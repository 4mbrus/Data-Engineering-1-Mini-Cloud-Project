There’s an economic explanation for why everything feels so tense right now,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/business/economy-tense-nightcap,"Oct 28, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","A version of this story will appear in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.
A collective angst is taking root. Maybe you feel it watching the news, scrolling social media, standing in line at the grocery checkout. Something’s off, and maybe it’s been that way for a while, but it hasn’talwaysbeen this tense, right?
While there are myriad reasons for our individual anxieties, there are also economic realities underpinning our agita. Some call it aK-shaped economy, in which the wealthy are getting richer and the poor are becoming worse off. None of that is especially new, but what makes this moment different is the utter flimsiness of it all. The sense — amplified bytech outages,a government shutdownandvolatile markets— that we’re just one slip-up away from calamity.
If you’re standing somewhere on the top rung of the K, the views are nice, but the ground may feel unsteady. That’s because the gains at the top are largely predicated on a speculative artificial intelligence stock market boom thateven some AI proponents saycould quickly fizzle — and potentially take the US economy down with it. Absent those AI investments, some analysts say, we’d bein a recession.
Yet another OpenAI financial entanglement is renewing fears of a repeat of the dot-com era
AI’s value is among the biggest known unknowns. President Donald Trump’sherky-jerky trade war maneuveringcertainly falls into that camp as well.
But then there are theunknownunknowns that have some investors on edge — the“cockroaches,” as Jamie Dimon called them, that have been propped up by the murky world of private and subprime credit markets and which could go bankrupt with shocking speed. “When you see one,” the JPMorgan Chase CEO said after the back-to-back bankruptcies of a subprime auto lender and an auto supplier, “there are probably more.”
There is a perception on Wall Street that “underneath strong economic numbers, there are crevasses of credit and valuation risks that are deepening and broadening,” wrote Macquarie strategists Viktor Shvets and Kyle Liu in a note to clients earlier this month.
They called the situation a “twilight zone” reminiscent of theSchrodinger’s cat experiment, in which two incompatible outcomes can simultaneously be true. The cat is both dead and alive; the economy is both weak and strong; AI is an overhyped bubble and AI is the future of everything; the Dodgers and the Blue Jays are both winning and losing the World Series.
These opposing situations will eventually resolve, of course, but in the meantime all most of us can do is flip a coin and hope for the best.
The struggles in the lower rung similarly reflect a fragile holding pattern.
Further complicating all of that: The Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to cut interest rates this week, is flying blind without the regular government data it and countless business leaders rely on.
Bottom line: The economy may be part of the reason you feel uneasy, whether you’re riding high on AI fervor or just trying to make rent month to month.
For investors, Shvets and Liu recommended that in this Schrodinger’s cat moment of uncertainty, either “go passive and spread risks widely” or focus on longer-term value investments over short-term shiny objects. “Both require lowering noise and tuning out news feeds as counterproductive distractions.”
“Will there be peace or war? Both. Will AI raise productivity or fall in a collapsing bubble? Both,” they write. “…Keep investment focus on the future.”"
"As the shutdown drags on, here’s how it can drag down the economy",https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/economy/us-government-shutdown-economy-snowball,"Oct 31, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","Thefederal government shutdownhas lasted all month and is on pace to become the longest on record.
While history has shown that the economy typically rebounds from a shutdown within a couple of months, each day it drags on bringsa greater risk that the economywon’t just bend but will start to break — and rupture livelihoods in the process, economists say.
“The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
Congressional Budget Office estimates released Wednesday projected that the shutdown has permanently sapped at least $7 billion in output from the economy.
The negative effects start to build on themselves very rapidly and the collateral damage becomes more widespread, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG.
“That’s kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering momentum and mass,” she said.
Predicting something that has becoming increasingly unpredictable is an impossible task, but here’s a look at how the shutdown could ripple through critical avenues of everyday life.
Prior to the shutdown, the US job marketwas already on its back.
It’s been alow-hire, low-fire, low-churn environment. Employers, frozen by high economic and policy uncertainty, have held off making investments and adding workers. Some businesses have used this period to test the waters onartificial intelligenceand other technologies – in turn putting to the test that “low-fire” descriptor by announcing mass layoffs in recent weeks.
“We’re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,” Zandi said.
Considering that backdrop, the tepid job gains can potentially turn into deeper job losses if safety nets become frayed, more paychecks are missed by federal workers and contractors, and spending pullbacks reverberate through the private sector, causing businesses to lay off workers or shut down, he said.
A US Chamber of Commerce analysis released this week estimated that 65,500 small business contractors have billions of dollars in payments at risk because of the shutdown — $12 billion in payments for the month alone.
Rate cuts and some greater clarity around trade deals and tariffs were supposed to fuel a rebound in hiring heading into 2026, noted Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at employment site ZipRecruiter.
“However, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year’s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,” she wrote in a note earlier this month. “This would delay hiring plans that might otherwise materialize, keeping the labor market stuck in place.”
US consumer confidence during October dipped to its lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump announced a massive suite of steep tariffs on imported goods, according to The Conference Board’s latest index released this week.
The expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage is at thecrux of the Congressional stalemateto fund the federal government and end the shutdown.
Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, whileRepublicans say they won’t negotiateuntil the government reopens.
Open enrollment starts on November 1, and the more than 22 million Americans who use the federal health insurance marketplace areexpected to see their monthly premium leapby 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis.
Also on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico are at risk oflosing access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households.
Any center closures could quickly increase financial hardship for lower-earnings families. Child care disruptions have been shown tonegatively impact labor force participation(particularlyfor women), productivity growth and overall economic growth.
The lengthier the shutdown, the higher the probability for a greater drag on overall economic activity, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.
“And this isn’t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you’re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn’t happen,” he said.
There’s the job that doesn’t get filled, the trip that doesn’t get taken and the holiday spending that doesn’t occur.
“At some point, things start to break because they’re just not getting done,” added Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics. “When this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence – consumer, business, investor confidence – the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.”
If the shutdown continues past Thanksgiving, “there’s no coming back from that quickly,” he said, adding that once it passes that “point of no return,” it will cause “damage that’s longer-lasting.”
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. It has remainedlargely resilient, despite massive uncertainty and persistently high inflation.
However, it’s likely done so because of an increasingly bifurcated, or“K-shaped” economy. Wealthy consumers, buoyed in part by strong market gains, are driving more of the spending while lower- and middle-income households are facing increased strain.
A drawn-out shutdown could inject further “crosscurrents” into an alreadychoppy price environment, Zandi said.
On one hand, disruptions to government services and funding could affect trade and supply chains, driving up prices. On the other hand, a weakened economy would mean it’s harder for companies to raise prices, which could help keep overall inflation in check.
“The net of all that, I think, is hard to know,” he said.
Still, the shutdown and its economic fallout could give the Federal Reserve one more reason tocontinue cutting interest rates, he added.
“The Fed’s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions,” he said. “This [shutdown] would weaken the already fragile job market more.”
The shutdown could very well exacerbate those struggles for many Americans, especially people on the margins.
Most Americans are “not taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they’re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment,” Zandi said. “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think so.”
A lack of funding for safety net programs,particularly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, could not only exacerbate hunger and hardship for tens of millions of Americans, but also threatens to destabilize local economies, especially in rural areas.
“It just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,” KPMG economist Swonk said. “Low- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.”
“It’s hard when you see the struggles we’re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,” she added.

The government is back open. Here’s what that means for economic data,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/14/economy/federal-data-what-to-expect-economic-data,"Nov 14, 2025, 11:48 AM ET","The US government has reopened following its longest-ever shutdown, setting the stage for the eventual release of the gold-standard federal data that is crucial in analyzing the health and trajectory of the nation’s economy.
Data nerds(and government officials,and Federal Reserve policymakers, and business owners, and, well,everyone else for that matter),rejoice!
Starting next week, the backlog of federal data will start flowing, and the long-awaited September jobs report (originally due out October 3) will publish Thursday, November 20, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Friday.
“It’s been like flying in fog without any instrumentation,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
However, expect some choppiness when the air starts to clear.
The very nature of the 43-day shutdown has created an unprecedented situation: Some datapoints were not gathered when they typically should have been, increasing the potential for big holes in what’s expected to be already messy data.
Since the government was dark for the entirety of October and the first dozen days of November, several reports that included data collected in September and scheduled to be released in the ensuing weeks were not delivered (with the exception of the Consumer Price Index), nor was data collected for October (we’ll get to that here shortly).
Other major reports in the wings – likely in various stages of completion – include September data on wholesale inflation, import and export prices, quarterly employment costs, annual consumer expenditures, retail sales, gross domestic product and consumer spending.
That remains to be seen.
The leading statistical agencies are in the process of updating their schedules for economic releases (a calendar set in place more than a year ago).
However, it’s not as simple as plugging reports into different dates. Several releases are reliant on data from other series. For example, CPI and Producer Price Index data points feed in to the Fed’s favored inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index,which in turn feeds in to GDP.
On Friday morning, the Bureau of Economic Analysis – the statistical arm of the Commerce Department that estimates GDP and produces data on topics such as income, spending, foreign trade, and state and local economies – announced it is “working to update its schedule of economic releases” and is consulting with the Census Bureau, BLS and other suppliers of data used to produce the BEA’s indicators.
Early Friday afternoon, the Census Bureau announced revised release dates for three reports originally slated to publish in early October. The August data on construction spending, manufacturers’ shipments and international trade will be released Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week, respectively.
Each economic data series will be affected differently by the shutdown, depending on how, when and from whom the data is collected, said Erica Groshen, a former BLS Commissioner who serves as senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.
Still, she noted, expect the BLS and other agencies to prioritizePrincipal Federal Economic Indicators, which are about three dozen major statistical series used to describe the condition of the US economy. (The jobs report, CPI, PPI, and PCE are among these. The Job Openings and Labor TurnoverSurvey, for example, is not).
As it stands now, October 2025 could very well amount to a “lost” month of data – or close to it.
During the shutdown, the nation’s statistical agencies were run by skeleton crews as the actions of collecting, analyzing and disseminating data were suspended – disrupting finely tuned processes that have underpinned major economic reports for decades.
For example, the jobs report is composed by two surveys: one of businesses and one of households. The establishment survey is primarily automated and relies upon online portals for businesses to submit their information such as workforce levels and pay. The household survey, on the other hand, is largely conducted via telephone and in-person visits.
“It’s very hard to ask people what their situation was five weeks ago, and it’s bound to be unreliable,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. “I think part of the employment report for the month of October will be lost forever, and we will only get the data that is submitted by companies.”
The household survey is what’s used to generate labor force estimates and the unemployment rate,and since that wasn’t conducted in October, “we’re going to get half the employment report,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassettsaid on Thursday. “We’ll get the jobs part, but we won’t get the unemployment rate.”
The lack of a complete monthly employment snapshot isn’t ideal when the US labor market entered the shutdown on seemingly shaky ground; however, a rough picture of the trajectory could still be assembledusing the payroll estimates combined with a smattering of private hiring data as well as state-level unemployment filings and layoff notices, wrote Mike Reid, senior US economist at RBC in a note Thursday.
Thevisibility on inflationdata for October will be “particularly bad,” Reid noted.
Two-thirds of the pricing data that feeds in to the CPI is collected by in-person visits to brick-and-mortar stores, Reid said. Wholesale-level prices also were not collected in October for the Producer Price Index.
That will then ripple through to the PCE price index, where about 90% is constructed from CPI and PPI inputs, he added.
“Unlike the labor market, there are few (if any) reliable alternatives to the CPI report,” he said. “Absent the CPI and PPI reports, it’s hard to gauge inflation’s trajectory.”
And if the October inflation data is released, it could pose a “serious data quality issue,” as it would likely lean more heavily onimputation, a methodology that utilizes a variety of existing datapoints to capture missing information.
“But we know that already when the statistical agencies have all the data available, there’s a big degree of uncertainty, and sometimes the numbers are not statistically significant,” EY-Parthenon’s Daco told CNN. “So, with even less data, the statistical significance of these numbers is likely to drop even further.”
The shutdown lasted through nearly half of November, meaning that this month’s data also will not emerge unscathed, economists said. However, they also fully expect all major reports to be released.
There’s a greater likelihood that inflation data will have a higher level of imputations, noted RBC’s Reid. The timing and staffing levels of returning BLS employees also could impact the collection of data, including the household survey for the jobs report, said former BLS Commissioner Groshen.
“BLS has fewer resources this time, because it is down 20% in its staffing, one-third of its leadership positions are vacant, and it’s possible they had even more people quit during the course of the shutdown,” she said, referencing the Trump administration’s large-scale layoff of federal workers earlier this year via the Department of Government Efficiency.
Still, while it’s possible that the surveying of households in November could include questions for October, it’s unlikely, she said, noting current staffing levels and the heft of the data backlog facing statistical agencies.
“There’s a very highly orchestrated way that those interviews are conducted, so just even running surveys simultaneously is problematic,” she said. “I would not be surprised if the Census Bureau and BLS just decided that they can’t run the October [household survey] again.”
If that’s the case, it’s possible that the BLS could estimate the October unemployment rate from the September and November data, she said.
“Noisy” reports aren’t out of the ordinary for major economic releases such as the jobs report. Large disruptions, including those considered relatively short term, have a way of leaving their mark on data for months (or, in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, for years).
Entering into evidence are the October 2024 and November 2024 jobs reports.
In October 2024, a month impacted by two major deadly hurricanes and massive labor strikes, the initial employment snapshot showed a net gain ofjust 12,000 jobs– a far cry from September’s 223,000-job gain.
It was also a one-time blip.
After striking workers and weather-waylaid employees went back to work in November, the jobs report for that month showeda surge of 227,000 jobs gained.
When the October 2025 jobs report is released, it’s expected to show significant job losses – perhaps to the tune of 1.5 million jobs, RBC’s Reid estimates – largely because of federal workers who were not on payrolls.
And, with the shutdown ending during the week that includes the 12th of the month – the period the BLS uses to tabulate employment – the November jobs report should capture the return of those employees and contractors to payrolls.
Still, the shutdown gummed up the nation’s statistical machinery, and it could take a couple of weeks for everything to get sorted out and running smoothly again.
“It’ll likely be the February period, where we get the January data, before we get our first real clean look at the US macroeconomic data,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. “So, there’s a price to be paid there in terms of the quantity and quality of the data that we’re going to get until early winter 2026.”
The privately produced data provided a sense of what the federal data could show; however, if those expectations are dashed, there is potential for wide swings in the markets, said Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics.
“If they hit the mark, and that’s what they show, then no harm, no foul,” he said. “If, though, the numbers come out and vary from what we expect – either on the upside on the downside – then that may call into question the Fed policy that’s been done since the shutdown.”
US stocks hadtheir worst day in a monthThursday and were lower Friday as traders digested news that the government had reopened. Investors braced for weeks’ worth of data set to be released in short order.
“I say this only half-jokingly: Maybe because the government is opening up again, the market took a dive,” economist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research told CNN’s Matt Egan. “When the government was shut down we could believe whatever we wanted to believe. Now we need to be data dependent and that may not be as much fun.”

Walmart just proved it’s America’s solution to the affordability crisis,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/business/walmart-economy-consumers,"Nov 20, 2025, 7:13 AM ET","Walmart is proving to be America’s antidote to the cost of living crisis.
A growing number of Americans are heading to Walmart for groceries and clothing as inflation and high prices squeeze their budgets: Walmart’s business in the United States is surging and it’s gaining market share from rivals, the company said Thursday in its quarterly financial report.
Walmart has used its massive size and scale to drive down prices and pour billions of dollars into investments such as raising wages, sprucing up stores and building a logistics network for online shopping.
These investments are paying off for Walmart at a moment when many Americans’ finances are stretched.
Last quarter, Walmart’s US sales increased 4.5%. Walmart saw an uptick in customer trips to stores, and shoppers spent more when they visited. Walmart also raised its sales and profit guidance, signaling it expects a strong holiday shopping season.
Walmart’s gains have been led by middle-class and upper-income households turning to its stores and website to try to save money.
“We’re gaining market share, improving delivery speed, and managing inventory well,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a news release. “We’re well positioned for a strong finish to the year and beyond that.”
McMillon announced Friday that he’sretiringsoon as CEO after 11 years. He’ll be succeeded in February by John Furner, who heads Walmart’s US operations.
Walmart is gaining over Target in particular.Target’ssales have stagnated for around four years.
One major advantage Walmart has over Target is its grocery business.
Shoppers make frequent trips to stores to pick up groceries, and Walmart has made improving its produce section a top priority in recent years. The company has also narrowed the gap with Target on apparel and home goods.
As shoppers tighten their spending, more are choosing Walmart over Target.
Walmart has alsopeeled offlower-income customers from Dollar General and other discount stores."
What will happen next in this topsy-turvy stock market? Choose your own Wall Street adventure!,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/investing/wall-street-economy-concerns,"Oct 17, 2025, 12:40 PM ET","The stock market issending mixed signalsat the moment, caught in a tangle of overlapping anxieties. Predicting its next move depends heavily on which narrative you want to believe.
You could choose door No. 1 and subscribe to the dominant concern of the week: A number of high-profile bankruptcies in consumer-facing industries may have exposed an underlying economic weakness thatthreatens parts of the banking sector.
A small number of regional banks have reported some bad loans this past week. The bankruptcies of a major auto parts company and a subprime auto lender have exposed bigger lenders, including JPMorgan and Wall Street finance company Jefferies, to potentially significant losses.
A number of the lenders are alleging they were victims of fraud. But if you believe these are canaries in the coal mine – and not a series of isolated incidents – it might mean a growing number of consumers won’t be able to pay back their loans or may rein in their spending with companies that owe banks a bunch of money. That could drag down lenders that are most susceptible if the economy really starts to take a turn for the worse.
To paraphrase JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week, these bank problems may becockroachesthat could signal the presence of other hidden cockroaches.
Markets hit their most recent record just last Wednesday. But they started to stumble after Chinaramped up export controlson keyrare-earth mineralsthat the Trump administration has been negotiating for months to free up. Those rare-earths are used in practically everything that beeps, including consumer electronics and military equipment.
President Donald Trump last Friday said he’s had enough, threatening a major re-escalation of the global trade war. He said he’dsend China’s tariffs higherby 100 percentage points and saw no need to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a high-profile planned meeting in South Korea later this month.
Trump and his administration quickly walked back those threats, confirming a Xi meeting was still on. And today Trump said he understood significantly higher tariffs on China wouldn’t be sustainable.
But Trump has changed his mind on tariffs before, and it’s too soon to count out amajor escalation in trade tensions. If that happens, Morgan Stanley analysts predicted the market could quickly tumble 11% into a correction.
Big Tech and the promise of AI have fueled the historic rise in stocks this year, particularly since April. But analysts have warned in recent months that this is a one-legged stool – and AI companies’ high valuations can’t support the market forever.
Some see echoes of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s that went bust in the early 2000s. Stocks have never been pricier as measured by the ratio of share price to companies’ actual sales. And the top eight most valuable stocks on the market – all worth north of $1 trillion – are all heavily invested in AI.
All that froth suggests to some that valuations have gotten out of whack with reality, and the AI-powered gains are due for a serious reality check.
Still, bubbles are notoriously hard to predict, and Wall Street’s majority opinion appears to be that the run-up in AI stocks as just the beginning of a long-run trend that will power the stock market for many years to come.
Investors have largely ignored the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs over the past six months, as prognosticators’ worst predictions about high inflation and a slowing economy have failed to come to fruition.
However,inflationison the rise, albeit slowly. Hiring hasslowed to a crawl. Trade with the United States has slowed due to higher tariffs. And some consumers have been jostled by rising prices, with delinquencies and subprime debt rising for lower-income tiers.
Ironically, cracks in the economy have helped drive stocks higher, because the underperforming job market forced the wait-and-see Federal Reserve to lose patience and start its recent rate-cutting campaign.
But the Fed may not be able to cut rates for long if so-calledstagflation– high inflation and stagnant economic growth – becomes a real concern. At that point, the Fed may be forced to deal with an inflation problem all over again.
Geopolitical tensions could be easing in Ukraine and the Middle East, and meetings are lined up between Trump and his Chinese counterpart; and with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. As with the recent ceasefire in Gaza, those meetings have the potential to turn down the temperature, at least somewhat, in some of the most concerning parts of the globe.
Meanwhile, worries about oversupply have pressured the oil market, with the price of Brent and WTI both at near five-month lows – potentially easing the inflation burden for Americans, if gas prices follow oil prices lower.
And the latest concerns about regional banks, though bringing back bad memories of a couple years ago, may prove to be as contained as theregional bank crisis of 2023.
More bad headlines may continue to jostle the markets in the near-term. But not much has really changed: Stocks are down just about 2% from their record high. If they fall further, that could present a good buying opportunity to get back into the market when stocks are relatively cheap.
“We would view deeper pullbacks as opportunities to lean in, as the bull market still deserves the benefit of the doubt,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist, in a note to clients Friday
Put another way: “We are keeping our powder dry and ready to buy the dip,” said Mohit Kumar, chief economist at Jefferies."
The government shutdown’s impact is spreading through the economy,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/business/government-shutdown-business-economy,"Oct 24, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","“The shutdown is stifling our ability to grow,” said Grant Richardson, who founded a wine import company, Pangea Selections, in 2019.
Richardson can’t close on a six-figure Small Business Administrationloan while the federal government is shut down, but the impasse hasn’t given him a break on the roughly $20,000 in tariffs that he expects to fork over this month.
The entrepreneur from Austin, Texas, is still waiting to receive roughly $10,000 in business tax credits for the quarter. And he can’t seal a deal with a California winemaker to launch a new product line because the government is not approving new labels for bottles during the funding lapse.
“The government is still taking money from us, but it’s not paying out what it owes,” he said, referring to the tax credits.
The shutdown has frozen many of the government’s key functions, such as lending and processing tax credits. And now without pay, hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country have pulled back on spending, creating economic ripple effects.
From restaurants in Washington, DC, to businesses around national parks, the shutdown’s impact is spreading through the US economy, with no relief in sight.
Sean Han, chef manager at Market to Market, a cafeteria at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, said foot traffic has declined about 20% to 30% since the government shutdown began — during a year that has already been tough because of mass federal layoffs.
The business hasn’t reduced employees’ hours yet, he said, but that could happen — in addition to the possibility of layoffs — if the shutdown drags on for longer. With fewer customers, Han said he directed workers to focus on giving whoever comes in a better dining experience.
“We’ve been around for about 20 years, so we’ve seen this before,” Han said. “But it took us nine months to recover after the pandemic and we’ll have to rebuild again once this ends.”
Restaurant reservations in Washington were down 9% last week compared to the same week a year earlier, according to data from OpenTable.
In North Carolina, Pam Anderson is caring for only a handful of dogs at her Ocean Sands K-9 Resort in Kill Devil Hills.
Some of her local clients have been calling off or shortening their vacations because the impasse has affected the national parks, or they are federal employees who are not being paid. At the same time, she is not getting any bookings from tourists, which she suspects is because the popular Wright Brothers National Memorial has shuttered.
Just this week, a local family who planned to leave their two dogs with her for a few days in mid-November pulled out, which will cost her $500 in lost revenue. The couple works for the federal government.
Although the kennel had a “rocking September,” reservations are down 40% for October and 60% for November so far compared to last year, leading Anderson and her husband to tighten their belts. They have stopped going out to dinner a few times a week and are holding off on their charitable giving.
“I told my husband the other day, ‘Don’t spend any money’,” said Anderson, 70, who is thinking of getting a night job.
Last March, restauranteur Fran Bolden opened a cafeteria at the Redstone Arsenal, a US Army base near Huntsville, Alabama. It was a profitable side venture for Bolden in a town whoseeconomic lifelineis the military, defense and aerospace industries.
But that restaurant, Arsenal Eats, is now shuttered until the government reopens. Bolden said they usually expect around 150 people a day for breakfast and lunch; the past two weeks saw only between 25 to 30.
“The volume is just not there,” she said.
Businesses all over downtown Huntsville and beyond are feeling the pinch, she said, and small businesses bear a big brunt of the burden.
“The local economy is in a military city. With people not out, not spending money, not sure what to do – we rely on the business of these people in order to be able to sustain ourselves,” Bolden said.
For the past two years, toddlers at Bernard Jackson’s swim and wellness center in Washington, DC, have learned to float for the first time, and seniors in their eighties have practiced gentle exercises to stay strong.
But the shutdown has taken a heavy toll. With fewer families able to afford lessons and operating costs on the rise, Jackson has had to make difficult choices just to keep his doors open. Many of his clients are federal employees directly affected by the lapse in pay.
“Since people are not getting paid, they aren’t coming to their lessons,” Jackson told CNN as he was leaving an unemployment center.
“I can tell you at least 40% of my revenue has gone down.”
Even as attendance drops, Jackson is finding ways to support his clients. He continues to send instructions and exercises for them to practice at home.
“The pool is still open,” he said."
How Trump built — and is now losing — his golden economic touch,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/trump-affordability-rebate-checks-snap-economy-analysis,"Nov 14, 2025, 12:00 AM ET","It was some feat for Donald Trump, a billionaire with his own airliner who lived in an eponymous skyscraper in liberal New York and wintered in a Florida palace, to brand himself as the conservative champion of working Americans.
But his political alchemy on the economy is dissolving.
Trump’s presidency is taking a wobble as he flaunts his sun king’s life of luxury and obsesses over building, literally, his personal legacy with vanity projects like aWhite House ballroomover his campaign vow to make America affordable again.
Trump is coming across as increasingly oblivious to awave of economic insecuritysweeping the nation, which is hitting many of the voters he won over in two presidential election victories as he transformed the GOP from its starchy country-club roots to ablue-collarelection machine.
It might be agolden ageforWhite House decor, but the new era of prosperity that he promised in 2024 is still elusive.
A slew of recent polling showsdeep pessimismamong Americans about the current state of the economy and its prospects. But Trump doesn’t want to know.  “The economy is my thing. And we have the greatest economy in history,” he told Fox News this week. He seemed irritated to be confronted with questions about high costs for food and housing.
This retreat into a gilded bubble couldn’t come at a worse political moment. Hisapproval ratingsare tanking. TheEpstein scandalis back to haunt him. And the Beltway political and media world has suddenly discovered the new buzz issue of “affordability” after Democrats won gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey with populist economic promises.
As he seeks to stave off lame-duck status, Trump desperately needs to rediscover his common economic touch. If he fails, the midterm elections next year could be grim for Republicans.
Trump’s initial electoral edge on the economy was a shrewd mix of branding, a political sixth sense about resentment boiling in hollowed-out industrial heartlands in 2015 and his own mystique as a consummate dealmaker.
Critics in recent days have lampooned his perceived lack of empathy for citizens who are struggling economically. But he was never a Bill Clinton-style “feel your pain” politician. Trump instead amplified the voice of voters who believed they’d paid the price for the globalization and free trade policies that made the establishment elite rich. He might have been wealthy —but he was never in the club. Like his base, he knew what it felt like to be left out: He’d been spurned by high society for decades, deemed vulgar and nouveau riche.
“We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon,” Trump said in his searing first inaugural address in 2017. “One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.”
Trump’s political magic was also cultural. His dystopian tirades on immigration and crime were popular. His vulgarity helped him pose as an outsider. And the Democratic Party’s turn to aspirational upper middle-class voters and apparent disdain for those immortalized in Hillary Clinton’s disastrous “basket of deplorables” comment helped sever it from the working class. Trump’s birtherism campaign against Barack Obama was a way to exploit backlash to the first Black presidency. And a leftward move by Democrats on social issues drove more voters into his camp.
Trump also had something else — a mythology of success. His spell on NBC’s “The Apprentice” evoked the image of a self-made business titan. If he made himself rich, why not everyone else? Trump rally-goers often cited this as a reason to vote for him, even if Trump’s history of business scrapes and near-bankruptcies told a more questionable story about his effectiveness as a tycoon.
In the 2024 campaign, Trump rode the advantage of fond memories of the pre-pandemic economy in his first term. It was also easy to lambaste the Biden administration’s months of denial on inflation and the failure of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to spell out her own convincing appeal to the middle class.  Trump posed in an apron andworked the fry stationat a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania, boosting his common-man credentials.
It would not be true to say that Trump has done nothing to tackle costs felt by working Americans. His entire economic policy, including tariff hikes on almost every country in the world, is designed to revive the glory days of the 20th-century factory economy. “If you think about your hometown in the state that you grew up, Main Street looks a lot different today than it did many years ago. And President Trump wants to restore America as a manufacturing superpower around the globe,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in March.
The White House claims the massive tax cuts in Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” put more money in the pockets of most Americans, even ifthe wealthiest did best. It says its program of gutting regulations and canceling wasteful spending will do the same. Next year, a new portal known asTrumpRxwill seek to lower drug prices. Last week, the president announced a deal with two pharma giants to lower the price of obesity drugs. The administration claims tariffs raised trillions of dollars. The stock market has been on a tear.
Evidence is mounting that Trump’s policies are making the affordability crisis worse. His tariffs are raising the price of goods for Americans. He’s had to promise a massive bailout to farmers hammered by his trade war policies. His new brainwave is for$2,000 paymentsto Americans pulled from government coffers swelled by tariffs. This sounds like a nice idea. But it could backfire by spiking inflation — and it is hardly a long-term answer for millions of Americans juggling bills and cutting back on the basics, who are now also confronting fears that AI will take their jobs.
The administration implicitly acknowledged its policies are making things harder for working Americans when Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week pledged swift tariff relief on some staples like coffee and fruit. “Coffee, we’re going to lower some tariffs. We’re going to have some coffee come in. We’re going to take care of all this stuff very quickly, very easily. It’s surgical. It’s beautiful to watch,” Trump said on Fox.
But he was partly to blame for the spiking price of a cup of joe, having slappeda 50% tariffon major producer Brazil because it prosecuted his friend former President Jair Bolsonaro for election interference. If ever there was a case of a president’s fixations making life worse for his people, this was it.
When all else fails, there’s always denial. Trump suggested on Fox that polls highlighting anxiety over the economy were fake. Andon “60 Minutes” this monthhe said, “We have no inflation” and, “Our groceries are down.”
The inflation rate is 3.0%, far lower than its peaks during the Biden administration. But in the political argument it’s often forgotten that prices aren’t going down; the rate at which they are increasing has simply slowed. It’s an equation every shopper understands, even if the president doesn’t.
The gap between peoples’ experiences of the economy and his sunny diagnosis of the country’s performance is highlighting how Trump, a politician who performs best when he has an enemy to attack, lacks a vocabulary for empathy. He’s a salesman, a booster, or as his critics would say, a con man who thrives on hyperbole.
Trump is not alone among presidents in struggling to articulate a positive economic message in tough times. In a 1992 campaign debate, President George H.W. Bush was caught looking at his watch while Clinton connected on voters’ economic struggles, creating an instant metaphor of indifference. During the 2012 campaign, Obama’s advisers struggled to find the balance between celebrating the rebound from the Great Recession without appearing oblivious to the unresolved struggles of many voters who weren’t feeling it.
Trump’s behavior in the government shutdown made his case harder — for instance, when he asked the Supreme Court tostop food stamp paymentsto more than 40 million Americans, handing Democrats an easy political weapon. And his indifference to rising health insurance premiums doesn’t help much either.
Trump’s advisers know he has a problem. They are considering whether he should tour the country togive economy-focused speeches. This follows calls from some Republicans, like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for him to drill down on “America First” economic policies after months spent trying to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
“The president gets it. He knows this is an issue,” a senior White House official told CNN’s Alayna Treene. “But he’s frustrated he’s not getting credit for what he’s doing.”
Scheduling Trump for a scripted speech might sound like a good idea. But it could backfire, like the infamous time in the 2024 campaign when he went to North Carolina to engineer an economic pivot and a wild campaign rally broke out. “They wanted to do a speech on the economy so we are doing this as an intellectual speech. You are all intellectuals today,” he told his crowd, mocking his own campaign strategy.
A better option must just be to hold rallies. They might at least restore his political mojo and renew his connection with his voters. Rallies have played an important role for Trump. He used them almost like vast focus groups, testing out lines scanning the crowd to test reactions. He has no such equivalent source of political intelligence in the White House, surrounded by obsequious aides, conservative media and his Cabinet of millionaires and billionaires. Trump does mingle on the patio of his Mar-a-Lago club. But hefty membership fees mean it’s hardly a haunt of working Americans.
Presidents often get too much credit when the economy roars and too little when it sours. But any prolonged downturn in the coming months could doom Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. And Democratic candidates showed the way for their colleagues in Virginia and New Jersey with blue-collar economic themes and by toning down progressive cultural rhetoric."
‘Things are pretty crappy.’ 1 in 4 US households are living paycheck to paycheck,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/13/economy/job-prices-debt-economy,"Nov 13, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Austin H. can’t wait to buy a house and start a family. But right now, the 34-year-old is barely getting by.
Austin is living paycheck to paycheck and saving almost no money, one of the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet in an increasingly unaffordable economy.
Worse, the family-owned construction business he works at is shutting down.
“I am going to be unemployed in the next month or two – with no safety net,” said Austin, who declined to share his last name.
An estimated 24% of US households are living paycheck to paycheck so far in 2025, according to a Bank of America Institute analysis released this week. The bank’s researchers combed through internal data on its tens of millions of consumers and tracked how much income customers spent on necessities like housing, gasoline, groceries, child care and utilities.
They found that 24% of households spend over 95% of their income on those necessities, leaving little to nothing left over for the “nice-to-have” things like going out to dinner or taking a vacation, let alone saving.
Austin, who has a master’s degree in fine arts, said he’s applied to roughly 1,000 jobs over the past year – everything from teaching to construction – with no luck.
“To be 34 and living paycheck to paycheck with no savings, things are pretty crappy right now,” he said.
Austin is supporting his partner, a veterinary student, and worries about how the two of them will pay off his student debt on top of all their other expenses.
“We want to own a house and start a family, but I don’t know how we will ever get our feet under ourselves,” he said.
The Bank of America report is evidence of the K-shaped economy, where affluent Americans are faring far better than those at the bottom.
Many are struggling to get by, even as President Donald Trumpdismisses affordability concernsas a “con job” conjured up by Democrats based on “fake” polls.
But the rate of increase in households living paycheck to paycheck has slowed significantly this year, and while there is little change this year for middle- and high-income households, the share of lower-income households living paycheck to paycheck has jumped from 27% in 2023 to 29%, according to Bank of America.
“Higher income and lower income households are living in two different worlds,” Joe Wadford, economist at the Bank of America Institute, told CNN.
The problem is that paychecks among lower-income households are often not keeping up with prices – especially now thatinflation has reaccelerated.
After-tax wages increased about 2% in October year over year among middle-income consumers, Bank of America found. That’s below the 3% inflation rate as of September.
Wage growth for lower-income Americans is falling even further behind. Their after-tax wages increased just 1% year-over-year.
By contrast, high-income wages jumped 4%, safely outpacing the increase in the cost of living.
Wadford said the wage growth gap between high- and low-income Americans hasn’t been this high since 2016.
For Millennials like Austin, that gap is even bigger.
Wages have inched up just 1% for low-income Millennials, compared with 6% for high-income.
“We work full-time and have degrees. And we’re getting nowhere,” Austin said.
Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, said the large number of households living paycheck to paycheck underscores the “deepening affordability crisis” caused by five years of price hikes that have outpaced income gains.
For the broader economy, the risk is that many families struggling to get by and worried about their jobs opt to spend much more cautiously.
“This could weaken the foundation of a consumer-driven economy,” Daco said.
That’s especially true if layoffs gather steam in what had been a no-fire, no-hire job market.
Goldman Sachs economists warned in a recent research report of a growing “risk of labor market deterioration.” The Wall Street bank estimates there is a 20% to 25% chance that the US unemployment rate jumps by at least 0.5 percentage points in the next six months. That’s up from just a 10% chance as of six months ago.
Some Americans are falling behind on their bills – especially those with low credit scores.
The percentage of subprime borrowers who are at least60 days late on their car loansclimbed to 6.65% in October, according to Fitch Ratings.
That is the highest since Fitch tracking began in the early 1990s, surpassing the prior peak set in January and well above levels during the Great Financial Crisis.
This trend is a clear sign of financial distress, especially since car loans are historically the last payment Americans are willing to miss.
Bank of America has found that the number of households making just the minimum payment on their credit card is also rising, though so is the share of credit card users paying off their entire balance each month.
“There is a mixed bag. There are some signs of consumer health, and yet, within the minority of people experiencing financial stress, pressure is mounting,” said Wadford, the Bank of America economist.
Vanessa Jones, a 65-year-old grandmother living in Davenport, Iowa, took on a second nursing job two years ago because she couldn’t make ends meet.
“The cost of living is way too high. My savings have been depleted. I haven’t tapped into my retirement, but that looks like the next step,” she said.
Jones, the primary caregiver for her two grandchildren, was recently diagnosed with cancer and wound up with “astronomical” medical bills. Facing $85,000 in medical debt, she filed for bankruptcy.
Jones pushed back on politicians arguing there is no affordability crisis.
“The people claiming prices are lower are not actually buying their own groceries or trying to find the cheapest place to get their car fixed,” she said. “They need to walk in our shoes.”"
"The US economy added 42,000 private-sector jobs last month, more than expected",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/05/economy/us-jobs-private-sector-adp-october,"Nov 5, 2025, 8:19 AM ET","Private-sector job creation bounced back in October, according to a snapshot of the labor market that has become more closely watched in theabsence of official federal jobs data.
Payroll processing company ADP on Wednesday estimated that private-sector businesses added an estimated 42,000 jobs last month, a swing into positive territory after back-to-back months of job losses.
While October marked a return to job growth, ADP’s chief economist cautioned that the pace of hiring is running far slower than earlier this year and far more concentrated in a few sectors.
“That recovery is tepid, and it is not broad-based,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said during a call with reporters on Wednesday.
The largest job gains were spread across industries such as trade, transportation and utilities (+47,000 jobs); education and health services (+26,000); and financial activities (+11,000), ADP reported.
Those posting the biggest job losses were information (17,000 jobs lost), professional and business services (15,000 jobs lost), and leisure and hospitality (6,000 jobs lost).
“The most concerning trend would be that drop in leisure and hospitality, because that points swiftly back to the consumer and how healthy and resilient the consumer will be,” Richardson said. “In the last three months of the year, we’ve seen consumer resiliency push up employment in that sector, so this negative number is something to watch as we go into the holiday season.”
Richardson also flagged that hiring softness among small businesses could be another concerning sign as to the health of the economy, noting smaller companies’ outsized share of employment.
ADP’s monthly tally has shown a significant slowdown in the job market since the summer, with net losses for September and August. Following revisions released Wednesday, there weren’t as many jobs shed in September as ADP initially estimated. September’s losses now sit at 29,000 jobs (versus a 32,000-job loss) and 3,000 positions were shed in August.
Still, a bounce-back was expected for October. Last week, ADP launched a weekly “pulse” report of employment estimates. That report showed that private employers added an average of 14,250 jobs per week during the four weeks that ended October 11.
Wednesday’s job gains came in stronger than the 37,500 jobs added that economists expected, according to FactSet.
The pulse report was launched to “meet the moment,” Richardson said, noting the federal government shutdown’s resulting black hole of employment and other data.
While ADP’s estimates have always functioned as a proxy for the official monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics – which is typically released two days afterwards – the two sets of numbers don’t always track.
However, with no jobs report last month nor expected this month due to the shutdown, ADP’s data has taken on an outsized role for economists and investors looking to gauge the health of the economy.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the lack of government data is “clouding” the central bank’s view of economic activity and that a decision on a rate cut next month is not a “foregone conclusion.”
“If you’re driving in the fog, you slow down,” Powell said at a press conference following the October rate-setting committee meeting. “We’re going to have to do our jobs one way or the other. I hope by the time of the December meeting, we’re getting a better flow of data.”
The Fed implemented a quarter-point rate cut last week in order to shore up a softening labor market, but Fed Governor Lisa Cook this week said she sees more urgency for the central bank tofocus on stubborn inflationrather than on unemployment.
The latest Consumer Price Index report showed annual inflationreached 3% last month,the highest level since January. The most recent jobs report the BLS produced showedunemployment crept up to 4.3%in August and the economy added just 22,000 jobs that month. And, for the first time in several years, there arenot enough jobsfor everyone seeking employment, with roughly 7.2 million open roles but around 7.4 million unemployed people."
White House weighs stepped up domestic travel and speeches to improve Trump’s standing on the economy,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/trump-economy-white-house-strategy,"Nov 12, 2025, 4:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump’sadvisers have had conversations about him traveling the country to give economy-focused speeches as they privately weigh a number of strategies to improve his standing on the issue, administration officials told CNN.
Trump’s advisers acknowledge that they have an affordability problem that the president hasbristled at in public: Americans’ outlook on the economy is dour, and the administration’s efforts to ease their financial anxieties aren’t resonating.
“You can’t convince people that their experience, what they’re feeling at home, isn’t reality,” one of the officials said.
White House officials have advised the president not to brush away or outright dismiss that Americans are feeling squeezed byrising prices, they said. They have been actively putting “policy time” — as one of the officials characterized it — on Trump’s schedule with the goal of accelerating the administration’s efforts to tackle inflation.
While Trump has talked extensively about affordability in recent days, he has often downplayed the strain Americans are feeling, suggesting in a Fox News interview on Monday that polls capturing Americans’ economic anxiety are “fake.”
One of the strategies being discussed in the West Wing is for Trump to turn much of his attention to his domestic agenda. That includes ramping up his domestic travel, the officials said, and pulling back on his international trips. As the holidays draw near, there’s also a push to coordinate new messaging on what the administration is doing to help lower costs.
Two key factors last week — Democratic victories in Tuesday’s elections and the mounting pain of the record-long government shutdown — initially set off alarm bells, not only in the White House but in the Oval Office directly, about the magnitude of the issue, the officials said.
The discussions also come as Trump has been criticized, including by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of focusing more on his foreign policy and less on domestic concerns, though the president dismissed that notion on Monday.
“I have to view the presidency as a worldwide situation, not locally,” Trump said, responding to the criticism thathe was too busy meeting with foreign leaders. “But with all of that, I passed a great big beautiful bill, which is the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.”
The president, meanwhile, has been personally frustrated with Americans’ perception of his administration’s handling of the economy and the media’s coverage of it.
“The president gets it. He knows this is an issue,” a senior White House official said. “But he’s frustrated he’s not getting credit for what he’s doing,” pointing to energy deregulations and the extension of his 2017 tax cuts.
Trumpacknowledgedthat frustration last week, just hours after Democrats walked away with major wins in New Jersey, Virginia, New York City and California.
“I tell Republicans, you want to win elections, you got to talk about these facts,” he told a financial conference in Miami, concluding that his party has been too quiet about the economic accomplishments of his term so far. “You know, it’s really easy to win elections when you talk about the facts.”
Earlier in the day, Trump castigated Senate Republicans, arguing they weregetting “killed” politicallyby the government shutdown, which public polling showed Americans blaming more on the GOP and Trump than on Democrats.
It appears the shutdown could be over by week’s end, but officials argue that it has contributed to burgeoning concerns about the cost of living in the US. (The shutdown also exposed anotherpotential political liabilityfor the GOP in the form of rising health care premiums, which the party will be forced to grapple with after this week’s votes to reopen the government.)
Trump’s public comments on the economy have at times been reminiscent of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, who was widely seen as out of touch for initially downplaying the threat of inflation.
Pressed during Monday’s Fox News interview about why Americans say they’re down on the economy if he’s accomplished as much as he says he has to lower prices, Trump questioned the premise.
“I don’t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake,” Trump said. “We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.” He used the opportunity to point to the revenue being generated from his tariff policies. (In aCNN pollreleased last week, 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” That number topped out at 58% under Biden in CNN polling.)
Fact check: Trump’s lying spree about inflation
Some of the president’s defensive messaging has come from what he’s being told by his advisers, who have argued that his financial policies are working but need time to settle in, two of the officials said. They’ve also cautioned that while his tariffs have caused a temporary ripple in the economy, those hurdles will be smoothed out by the 2026 midterms.
“President Trump inherited the worst affordability crisis in modern American history, and in less than ten months, he stopped inflation in its tracks,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement. “The President’s pro-growth policies of deregulation and energy independence are bringing down gas prices, food prices, and inflation — and Americans will continue to benefit. Trust in Trump — he created the greatest economy in his first term and he is doing it again in his second term.”
Yet despite Trump’s grandiose claims about ushering in the best economy in history and knocking Democrats’ affordability message as a “con job,” he’s also taken steps in recent days to try to make his mark on the issue. He’s floated$2,000 tariff rebate checksto lower- and middle-income Americans, gone after meatpacking companies he’s accused of jacking up prices, and even raised the idea of a 50-year mortgage (a proposal that stemmed from Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte and one that many White House officials are not on board with).
All of those moves appear to be an indication of how the president is seeing the affordability issue resonate, even as he attempts to brush it off in another breath.
And while some in the White House see the new fixation on affordability as an overreaction to last week’s elections and shutdown anxiety, administration officials also want to avoid Biden’s mistakes, which means taking Americans’ perceptions about the economy seriously — and doing something about it.
With critical midterms that will shape the rest of Trump’s term now less than a year away, they don’t see time to waste."
Trump denies inflation is hurting Americans. It’s the same mistake that haunted Biden,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/trump-biden-economy-inflation,"Nov 4, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","“We have no inflation,” President Donald Trump said in his“60 Minutes” interviewSunday evening. “Our groceries are down.”
And withthose two false claims, Trump is repeating a political mistake that haunted his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and contributed to the Democrats losing the White House: Trump appears to be denying the economic reality that people are experiencing﻿ in their everyday lives.
Whether or not Trump is making a similar political miscalculation remains to be seen. Today’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City could serve as an indication.
Inflation is far from the crisis levels of the Biden years, but it never went away. And inflation is on the rebound again, rising in September to the highest annual rate since January in part because of the president’s tariffs.
Grocery prices aren’t down, either – they’re up across all major product categories, rising 1.4% since Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Denying that reality is a tough sell to Americans, many of whom seriously hate this economy, mainly because they feel those higher prices every time they go to the store.
A newCNN poll conducted by SSRSshowed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 47% call the economy and cost of living the top issue facing the country.
Bidenpolled miserably on the economy, too.
In June 2022, as millions of Americans were grappling with the highest gas price of their lifetimes and inflation hit a four-decade high, Biden highlighted strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
“Look, here’s where we are. We have the fastest growing economy in the world,” Biden said on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,”a claim that CNN later deemed false.
Biden conceded that inflation is “the bane of our existence,” but downplayed it by saying it’s “mostly in food, and in gasoline.”
That dismissiveness probably hurt the Democrats in last year’s election, considering Americans in 2024 said affordability was their chief concern. Even if inflation was falling, prices were still rising – just more slowly, and from painfully high levels. So voters weren’t exactly swayed by the Biden administration’s frequent statements that theeconomy was on fire.
“Wages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3% — the lowest in the world and trending lower,” Bidensaidduring his 2024 State of the Union address. “It takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.”
Voters didn’t buy it. Biden’s speech dismissed the cumulative effect of rising prices that voters were living through.
Trump’s tactics aren’t exactlyBiden’s. In 2023 and 2024, Biden correctly argued that price hikes were slowing. And when Biden acknowledged high prices, he typically tried to assign blame to corporations, lambasting “greedflation” and “shrinkflation.”
Trump is just straight-up doling out untruths – andblaming Biden.
But either way, the effect may be the same. Americans don’t take kindly to politicians who refuse to see voters’ lived experiences – especially when they’re smacked in the face with high prices on every supermarket trip.
Interestingly, Trump identified Biden’s flaw, and he and his campaign frequently criticized the former president for failing to sufficiently acknowledge the pain inflation had inflicted on Americans. Trump at campaign stops would sometimes pose with groceries, commenting on how unaffordable they had become.
The consequence of becoming president, of course, is that those inherited problemsquickly became Trump’s. But blaming Biden or denying reality doesn’t seem to be working. Trump is already starting to shoulder much of the blame for the bad economic vibes: About 6 in 10 (61%) say Trump’s policies have worsened US economic conditions, according to CNN’s poll.
Americans aren’t just kvetching about high prices; they’re (not) putting their money where their mouths are, and they’re changing their behavior.Chipotle, Coke, Crocsand other consumer brands said during earnings calls with Wall Street analysts last month that middle-class and lower-income customers are closing their wallets.
Despite a still-robust economy, on paper anyway, lackluster hiring is adding to Americans’ frayed nerves, as is the erosion of federal safety-net benefits.Loan defaultsand delinquencies are on the rise again among some of America’s most vulnerable.
The problem with inflation is that it’s cumulative. There is a snowballing effect from years of price hikes – even if those price increases are smaller today than under Biden after the pandemic.
The typical American household is spending $208 more per month to buy the same goods and services as they were in September 2024, according to Moody’s Analytics data based on the most recent inflation report. Keep in mind that in September 2024, Trump was on the campaign trail claiming inflation was out of control.
Zooming out further, Moody’s found that due to inflation, the typical household is spending $1,043 more per month than they did at the start of 2021.
In other words, to buy the same amount of stuff that Americans purchased four years ago, they ne﻿ed to spend $1,000 more of their paychecks.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week explained why Americans don’t care about metrics that politicians like to cite, including strong spending or gross domestic product booms.
“Consumers are not interested in that story,” Powell said in a media briefing Wednesday. “Their prices are higher. More than that, the reason they are so unhappy about inflation is the inflation we had in 2021, 2022 and 2023. You can say prices aren’t going up as much, but that doesn’t mean that people aren’t feeling those higher prices from the inflation we had two or three years ago. They are, and that is why a large part of the public, if you sample people, inflation is still very much making people unhappy.”
Powell noted it will take time – and growing paychecks – for the effect of higher prices to wear off.
“It will feel better over time, but that will take time,” he said.
Meanwhile, the lesson for Trump may have been best stated by Democratic political strategist David Plouffe.
In “Original Sin,” the book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson into Biden’s late-term cognitive decline, Plouffe said the fatal mistake by Democrats  was to deny the reality voters were witnessing.
“Never again can we as a party suggest to people that what they’re seeing is not true,” he said."
What bubble? The analysts and investors making the bull case for AI,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/27/tech/ai-bubble-analysts-bull-case,"Nov 27, 2025, 7:30 AM ET","Chipmaker Nvidia posted yet another blockbuster earnings report this month.
The stock fell anyway, as many investors worry that the market is in the middle of an about-to-burst AI bubble.
But for AI’s biggest believers, the report was just another sign that the industry’s train isn’t running out of steam anytime soon.
“Fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated in our view,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note last week. The Nvidia earnings report “is another validation point for the AI Revolution and (in) our view we are in the Top of the 3rd inning of this AI game  .”
The possibility of an AI bubble has loomed over the tech industry and Wall Street for years, but worries have ramped up sharply this year. Massive AI infrastructure spending, a string of circular deals among a few key big tech companies and seemingly endless rhetoric about AI’s world-changing potential – with little profit to show for it – have sparked concerns that we’re in for another dot-com-style bubble bursting.
About forty percent of the S&P 500 isnow made up of 10 tech companies, including Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, Oracle, Alphabet and Microsoft – all of which are betting big on an AI revolution.
There’s a lot at stake: The bursting of the dot-com bubble helped cause the 2001 recession and led theNasdaq to lose over 75% of its valueby late 2002.
But some analysts say investors should actually keep piling into AI. They argue there’s a big difference between AI and the dot-com era, when many early internet companies failed to find lucrative and steady business models, with notable exceptions like Amazon and eBay. AI companies, on the other hand, already have healthy business models or viable paths to profitability, they argue.
“The lesson of the dot com era is there was a bubble, it burst. We don’t think we’re in one now for AI,” Bob Michele, JP Morgan’s chief investment officer and head of the global fixed income, currency and commodities group,” said on CNBC last week.
And AI has far more potential to make money, Ravi Mhatre, co-founder of Lightspeed Venture Partners, told CNN. LSVP is a major backer of AI company Anthropic.
“The scale of revenue growth happening in this cycle is exponentially greater than prior cycles,” he said.
Rapid advancements in AI models also mean more uses are regularly popping up for the technology, Mhatre said.
Tech companies are already seeing increased cloud demand and productivity gains, especially in areas like coding and advertising. And there are plenty of growth markets geared to consumers –  ChatGPT recently addeda new toolto help shoppers research purchases, for example. But whether that growth will outpace costs, especially for smaller companies, remains  a big question.
Some investors believe the AI industry is at the beginning of a “super cycle” decade (or more) of innovation, investment and revenue. That could mean a global economy dominated and fundamentally changed by AI, they say.
“I tend to believe that the AI super cycle is real, that it is going to have a pretty profound impact on the economy, but you have to make room for the full range of outcomes when we price these things,” Marta Norton, Empower’s chief investment strategist, told Bloomberg Television last week.
Mhatre said there’s a bubble in that a rush of investments is chasing momentum that may not prove successful. But the industry itself might not be in a bubble.
“I do think both things are true. We’re in a hype cycle,” Mhatre said. “On the other hand, this kind of scale and speed with which value is getting created is also radically different than the prior cycles, where I just think the time that it took people to build technology and for it to be diffused was longer.”"
Saudi Arabia is making a massive bet on becoming a global AI powerhouse,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/tech/saudi-arabia-ai-powerhouse,"Nov 2, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Saudi Arabia is turning its oil wealth toward its massive AI ambitions.
Its chief investment vehicle is Humain, a homegrown company that is building out a full stack of data centers, cloud capabilities, large language models and applications. It’s owned by the Kingdom’s nearly $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund.
Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salmanunveiled Humain in Mayahead of President Donald Trump’sstate visit to Riyadh. This week, at the annual Future Investment Initiative in the same location, the scale, ambition and deep pockets behind the project came into clearer focus.
Humain CEO, Tareq Amin, is setting out to make Saudi Arabia the world’s third-largest AI market, after the United States and China. It’s a bold ambition for a newcomer to the industry, but Amin argues the Kingdom’s competitive edge lies in its abundant and cheap energy resources that can feed the seemingly insatiable demand for computing power.
“We have an advantage in Saudi Arabia,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “Look at this country’s amazing energy grid that doesn’t require a company like Humain to build the substations and the power to deliver that to a data center. That means I have saved 18 months of time.”
Saudi Arabia makes an AI play with Humain
Humain plans to build up to six gigawatts in data center capability across the country by 2034, with a rolodex of key AI partners, including Nvidia, AMD, Amazon Web Services, Qualcomm and Cisco.
On Tuesday, Humain announced a$3 billion dealwith private equity giant Blackstone to build data centers in the Kingdom.
It also publicly launchedHumain One, an AI-powered operating system where users speak or type to a computer to tell it to perform tasks, rather than clicking on icons, as is conventional in systems like Windows or iOS.
Humain has been using the AI system internally to run much of its HR, finance, legal, operational and IT departments. Amin says there is now only one employee in his payroll department, with AI agents handling the rest.
The Kingdom is entering the closing stretch of its Vision 2030 economic transformation plan facing headwinds from declining oil prices and delays in its construction of giga-projects like Neom, placing new urgency on its AI push to support the growth of the Arab world’s largest economy.
It alsofaces competitionfrom the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which has its own AI vehicle, G42, and recently secured a landmark deal with the Trump administration to build “Stargate UAE,” a sprawling $500 billion data center project billed as the largest outside the United States, with the help of OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco.
Asked whether there’s room for two regional heavyweights, Amin said he supports democratizing AI, while touting Humain’s robust operations.
“It is good for humanity to have knowledge — especially around AI — not to be all centralized in one location. So it’s good what is happening in the UAE. It’s very good what’s happening in Saudi Arabia,” he said. “I will tell you what we decided to do, which is very different … Humane is not a holding company. We are an operating company.”"
Polls show Trump’s happy talk on inflation is falling flat,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/inflation-polls-trump,"Nov 20, 2025, 1:04 PM ET","The 2025 election two weeks ago crystallized how big a problem the economy and affordability appear to be for President Donald Trump and the Republican Party.
Trump’s initial strategy for dealing with this problem appeared to be  pretending it didn’t actually exist. Trump set about falselyclaiming prices were actually down, that there is “almost no inflation,” and that everything was more or less hunky dory.
Itwas bizarre, even from a president who often seems to reside in his own elaborately crafted alternate reality.
And it appears to be falling flat.
New polling conducted since Trump began driving this message shows Americans continue to see things very differently than Trump has cast them. And their reviews of his economic stewardship appear to actually be getting worse.
“Our groceries are way down. Everything is way down,” Trump said November 6. “Groceries are way down, other than beef,” he said at another point. He added last week that grocery prices were “already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.”
But just 12% of Americans said grocery prices have gone down over the last six months, according to a newMarquette University Law School pollconducted November 5 through 12.
By contrast, 75% said they’ve gone up.
(Average grocery prices were indeedup roughly 1.4%in September compared to when  Trump took office in January, and the 0.6% jump in one month from July to August was the largest in three years.)
Even among Republicans, only 2 in 10 subscribed to Trump’s alternate version of reality in which prices are actually dropping. A majority said prices are up.
The numbers were similar in a Fox News poll released Thursday.
That poll, conducted November 14 to 17, showed 85% of registered voters  said grocery prices are higher than a year ago, with 60% saying they’ve “increased a lot.”
Around two-thirds or more also said the prices of utilities, healthcare and housing were up.
(“A year ago” technically includes two months in which Trump was not yet president, but it stands to reason people perceived the question as being mostly about his tenure.)
Perhaps most striking: The percentage who say grocery prices are up “a lot” (60%) is significantly higher than the percentage who said that about groceries and everyday items back in October 2021 (43%). This despite inflation back then having been about double what it is today.
That suggests this problem is really ingrained – and will be difficult for Trump to defeat with happy talk.
Trump has claimed there is “virtually no inflation,” “almost no inflation” and said inflation is “almost nonexistent.” He has also said “we don’t have any inflation.”
In fact, inflation has remained stubborn throughout Trump’s tenure and is at about 3% on an annualized basis – right where it was when he took over.
And the perception might be even worse.
52% of registered voters  said inflation was “not at all” under control, according to the Fox poll. That includes nearly two-thirds of independents (65%).
Fewer than 2 in 10 overall – and only one-third of Republicans – said inflation was at least “mostly” under control.
To the extent Trump has allowed that there are economic pains, he’s generally cast them as remnants of the Biden era.
“Biden was a disaster with affordability,” Trump told Fox News shortly after the election. He added: “When I took over, it was a mess.”
But this, too, appears to be a losing argument.
The Fox News poll asked whether Trump or Biden were more responsible for the current economy, and voters  chose Trump, 62%-32%.
Only around half of Republicans (53%) blamed Biden.
The gamble for Trump in pitching this alternate reality is evident: If people don’t ultimately subscribe to it, they might come to view Trump as out of touch and  not taking the problem seriously enough.
Already,CBS News-YouGov pollinghas shown 75% of Americans and a majority of Republicans have said Trump is not focused enough on lowering prices.
And indeed, it seems Trump is doing himself no favors right now. If anything, his political picture on the economy and affordability is worsening:
The same poll shows Americans say by about a 2-to-1 margin that they expected Trump’s policies will continue to increase inflation.
Indeed, Trump has given people plenty of reason to attach whatever happens with the economy to him. That’s what happens when you rock the economy with a series of unilateral global tariffs that weren’t even endorsed by Republicans in Congress.
Trump voluntarily took ownership of the economy. Now he wants to disclaim the reality of what’s followed.
Political analysts love to mine Trump’s actions for secret political strategy and three-dimensional chess moves. But this seems more like desperation than anything else."
Americans are feeling worse about the economy as government shutdown drags on,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/07/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-november,"Nov 7, 2025, 10:08 AM ET","The record-breaking government shutdown has left Americans feeling worse about the economic outlook. That’s according to the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, which showed the index falling to 50.3 this month from 53.6 in October.
It’s the lowest level since June 2022, which marked the lowest reading on record since the survey’s inception in the 1950s.
“With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” Joanne Hsu, director of surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement.
The drop this month represents a 6.2% decline from October and a 29.9% decline compared to last November. Meanwhile, economists polled by FactSet had been anticipating a slight improvement this month.
“The index certainly looks like the economy is ready to roll over the proverbial cliff,” Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, said in commentary issued Friday.
The increased level of pessimism was “widespread” across different ages, income levels and political affiliations, Hsu noted. The one notable exception was consumers who are heavily invested in the stock market. They reported an 11% improvement in sentiment as the stock market hangs near record highs.
That group of consumers is crucial because they have “the biggest influence on the aggregate consumer spending data, so continued strength here is important for the resilience of the economy overall,” Thomas Simmons, chief US economist at Jefferies, said in a note to clients Friday.
“However, that middle tercile is important too, and the decline in their sentiment appears to be intensifying. If this group is unable to continue to keep up their pace of spending, the top-line growth numbers may finally break from their above-trend pace,” he said.
This story is developing and will be updated."
"A first look at November hiring shows the private sector lost 32,000 jobs",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/economy/us-adp-private-jobs-report-november,"Dec 3, 2025, 8:20 AM ET","Small businesses are starting to crack amid a weakening economy, rising costs and fickle consumers; and they drove job losses in the US private sector in November, payroll giant ADP reported Wednesday.
ADP’s latest monthly look at private-sector employment showed that about 32,000 jobs were lost last month, marking a drop-off from the upwardly revised 47,000 jobs gained in October.
ADP’s reports have gained in prominence in recent weeks as the longest shutdown in US historystifled statistical agencies’ abilities to collect, analyze and release economic data.
The November jobs report, originally slated for release on Friday, isdelayed until December 16. It also will include partial data from October, a month where a full jobs report was nixed.
As such, Wednesday ADP data is likely the next-best estimate on the labor market Federal Reserve officials will get before their policymaking meeting next week.
Still, while ADP’s tabulations don’t often correlate with theofficial jobs numbers, they’re looked to as an indicator of hiring and wage growth activity.
And in recent months, that trajectory hasn’t been great.
Consumer confidence falls to lowest in seven months as concerns grow about the economy
Private employers have shed jobs in four of the past six months, ADP data shows. The net loss of 32,000 reported for November is the largest monthly drop in two and a half years.
“The (ADP) report shows the job market is losing more momentum at year-end and skews risks toward modestly higher unemployment early next year,” Oren Klachkin, Nationwide’s financial markets economist, wrote in a note Wednesday. “There’s a high level of disagreement among Fed policymakers right now, but we maintain our call the doves will prevail over the hawks and the FOMC to vote for another [quarter-point] interest rate reduction at next week’s meeting.”
The estimated job losses reported for November were overwhelmingly at small establishments (classified as having between one and 49 employees), which shed an estimated 120,000 jobs last month. Medium and large businesses added 51,000 jobs and 39,000 jobs, respectively.
“When you look historically, the labor market is not weak, but it is weakening — and the first to crack are small establishments,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said Wednesday in a call with reporters. “I see them as a canary in the coal mine. Things could shift, but small firms are the leading indicator.”
It’s possible that the steep losses at small businesses could be tied to spillover effects from theUS government shutdown, which lasted from October 1 to November 12, she said.
However, the estimated labor force cutbacks are likely more a reflection of small businesses trying to weather an uncertain economic environment and an increasingly cautious consumer, she said.
“You can see that there are a lot of different angles of concern for the smallest firms: It’s about supply, it’s about high price levels,” she said Wednesday. “Even if you think that inflation is declining or moderate or any tariff impact is transitory, if you look at cumulative price increases over the last five years, it’s up around 25%.”
And when small businesses don’t have the wiggle room to navigate higher prices – notably the ability toabsorb cost increasesfromfrequently shifting tariffs– they often shift their hiring patterns to help offset rising costs, she added.
Businesses are likely staying lean – delaying hiring, not replacing workers – versus making outright layoffs, so that they can weather an uncertain economic environment, she said.
“And all of that is adding up to job losses on a national level,” she said.
That low-hire, low-fire activity has been heavily supported by other economic data, specifically claims for unemployment benefits. First-time claims have remained fairly stable while continuing claims (those filed by people who have received a week or more in jobless benefits) have been butting up against four-year highs.
By industry, the losses were more broad-based, with some of the deeper drops in industries such as professional and business services, information and manufacturing.
Economists were expecting that 40,000 jobs would be added, according to FactSet.

Vance pleads for ‘patience’ on the economy in sharp departure from Trump’s rhetoric,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/jd-vance-economy-patience-trump,"Nov 20, 2025, 2:01 PM ET","Vice President JD Vance on Thursday acknowledged that the Trump administration faces growingskepticism over its economic record, issuing a plea for patience ahead of what he predicted would be an eventual “economic boom.”
“We get it and we hear you, and we know that there’s a lot of work to do,” Vance said during a Breitbart News event. “As much progress as we’ve made, it’s going to take a little time for Americans to feel that.”
The conciliatory tone represented a sharply different approach from the one taken in recent weeks by President Donald Trump, who hascontinued to insistthat the economy is thriving while dismissing cost-of-living concerns as little more than a Democratic talking point.
It also underscored the White House’s ongoing efforts to calibrate its messaging on the economy ahead of next year’s midterm elections — and in theaftermath of GOP losses in New Jersey and Virginiaearlier this month that voters indicated were driven in large part by deep disappointment with Trump’s domestic agenda.
Vance during his remarks conceded that Americans remained unhappy over the affordability issues that have weighed on those approval ratings, such as theprice of groceries. At one point, he went as far as to undercut one of Trump’s key barometers of economic success — a decline in the price of eggs since January — by admitting that the food staple is still too expensive for many people.
“If you’re an American who’s just struggling to get by, you work hard, you pay your taxes, you want your kids to have good opportunities. And then the price of eggs goes from $2 a dozen to $8 a dozen under the Biden administration, and then it goes from $8 a dozen to maybe $6.50 a dozen,” Vance said. “Well, to you that is still a major problem.”
The vice president sought to cast much of the blame for voters’ sour mood on former President Joe Biden, complaining that the prior administration had “put us in a very tough spot.” He also blamed Democrats for any near-term economic fallout from the record-longgovernment shutdown.
“I do think that actually pumped the brakes a little bit on all the economic news that we’re seeing,” Vance said of the shutdown. “That’s going to cause a little bit of damage.”
The vice president also celebrated astronger-than-expected September jobs reportreleased earlier on Thursday, calling it evidence that Trump’s policies were working.
Yet he allowed that the Trump administration still has plenty of work to do to convince voters that those policies stand to benefit them, departing from the president’s preferred approach of touting his agenda as an unqualified success.
At a US-Saudi Investment Forum a day earlier, Trump dismissed the focus on affordability, calling it a “new word” that Democrats have latched on to since he took office.
“The only thing that we’re going up in is our stock market, okay, we’re bringing prices down,” Trump said, despite the rise in the cost of key products likebeef and coffeethat economists have blamed at least in part on the administration’s tariffs. “But they came up with a new word that they’re using: affordability.”
The president in speeches and social media posts since Democrats’ electoral victories earlier this month has also called affordability concerns a “con job,” urging voters to credit him for falling gasoline prices and an inflation rate that’s come down from its Biden-era peak — but begun over the last several months to slowly climb once again.
The White House has floated a range of initiatives aimed at reining in the cost of living despite Trump’s insistence that prices are falling, including rolling back tariffs on hundreds of products and raising the prospect of sending $2,000 checks to Americans at some point next year. Trump isalso expected to step up domestic travelin the coming months focused on promoting his economic agenda, as aides try to boost voter awareness of the administration’s accomplishments.
Trump aides are also planning topitch a new health reform planahead of the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies amid GOP fears that the party will pay a hefty political price if voters’ health insurance costs skyrocket.
But the administration has offered few details about what that plan will look like. Though Vance on Thursday claimed the eventual proposal would get bipartisan support, he did not provide specifics.
The vice president also offered few new strategies for ushering in the booming economy that he said “we really do believe is coming,” arguing only that the administration needed a bit more time to realize its goals.
“The thing I’d ask from the American people is to ask for a little bit of patience,” Vance said. “We just gotta keep it going.”"
AI is about to face an enormous test. The market is already nervous,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/19/markets/nvidia-us-stock-market,"Nov 19, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market’srecent bout of volatility. So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday.
The stock market rally —﻿that had been going practically nonstop since April until this month’s blip — largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years.
Investors are now eager to know whether demand for Nvidia’s chips — and its optimism about the future — are continuing to grow or if there are signs of AI fatigue.
Earnings this month from tech company Palantir (PLTR), which uses AI for its government contracts, beat Wall Street’s estimates. However, concerns about the stock’s expensive valuation and nerves about a bubble gave investors pause — and fueled asell-off in AI stocksover the past several weeks. Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) has fallen more than 8% this month, although it’s still up 37% this year.
“The market for the first time is questioning whether the hype will turn into reality,” Bob Elliott, CIO at asset management firm Unlimited Funds, told CNN.
Nvidia’s chips power part of practically every major AI venture, meaning investors will scrutinize its earnings as well as chief executive Jensen Huang’s remarks.
“Nvidia takes on even greater weight than normal,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t confirm high expectations built into the market, then watch out below.”
Every investor should care about Nvidia’s earnings this afternoon: Nvidia accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. That means investors — and those with 401(k)s — are increasingly exposed to the company’s strong gains. Similarly, they are more exposed to a drop in Nvidia’s stock price.
As of Tuesday, Nvidia shares’ gains have accounted for 18% of the S&P 500’s total return this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Since Nvidia last reported earnings in August, concerns have been rising aboutcircular financing, with tech companies entwined in a massive web of extraordinarily lucrative deals.
Now nerves are fraying about whether the money being poured into the AI boom will be justified. On top of that, tech stocks have become relatively expensive.
“Nvidia’s earnings on Wednesday are particularly important given the rising skepticism regarding the longevity of the AI cycle and current AI stock valuations,” James Demmert,CIO at Main Street Research, said in an email. “Anything less than a stellar report and outlook could make stock indexes vulnerable.”
And it’s bigger than just Wall Street. There are concerns that the AI boom — which has helped boost US economic growth this year — is now masking signs of weakness in the economy.
At its market value of $4.4 trillion, Nvidia is currently larger than every country’s economy except the United States, China and Germany.
Nvidia’s fate is interlinked with other big tech companies that depend on its products. A sign of a slowdown in demand could signal that the other tech companies are less confident about the AI buildout.
Some Wall Street analysts are optimistic that Nvidia will continue to deliver impressive earnings. AI chatbots like ChatGPT — and the data centers powering AI — depend on the company’s chips. It’s the foundation of the current AI wave.
“That is why everyone listens to every word that Jensen Huang has to say, because it’s a good gauge of the health of the AI ecosystem,” said Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research.

Affordability is in crisis. The solution: You’ll never own anything again,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/economy/affordability-crisis-mortgage-debt-bnpl,"Nov 12, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","Stubborn inflationcontinues to make the cost of living unbearable for many Americans. A number of inventive solutions have emerged — but with a common theme: putting consumers deeper into debt.
This week’s50-year mortgage proposalfrom the Trump administration is the latest example of the trend. Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, remarked over the weekend on X that President Donald Trump’s proposal would be “a complete game changer.”
For many Americans, though, it may not be a good one.
The potential for a 50-year mortgage comes as the auto industry has been pushing seven-year car loans, which have become an increasingly popular option with theaverage price of a new carhitting a new record of more than $50,000. And the explosion of buy now, pay later options online and at brick-and-mortar retailers hasnormalizedtaking on longer-term debt for purchases as small as food delivery.
These offerings can help ease financial anxiety in the immediate future, but they can also do significant damage to a consumer’s financial stability over the long haul.
Case in point: While a 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments, the amount of interest a borrower would pay over 50 years could be double what would be paid at current rates over 30 years, the traditional length of most mortgages.
That’s assuming the borrower even survives the entire 50 years. With average American life expectancy at around 80 years old, most Americans would have to get a mortgage by the time they’re 30 to have a shot – albeit a slim one – at reaping the benefits of homeownership.
“Generally speaking, the more you can avoid longer-than-usual loan terms, the better,” said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. “Cars tend to lose value rapidly when you drive them off the lot, so with a longer-term loan, you run the risk of owing more on the car than it is worth. That’s not a good situation for anyone.”
Buy now, pay later (BNPL), an increasingly popular option for delaying payment, allows many Americans to own more goods by giving them an instant stream of funds to tap into. But, increasingly, consumers — especially younger ones — are making purchases they otherwise may not have been able to afford, as evidenced by the recent uptick in late payments.
A Federal Reserve study published last year on BNPL users reported that “adults who report lower overall financial well-being and those who appear liquidity or credit constrained were not only among the most likely to use BNPL, but most of these consumers also indicated that they used BNPL because it was the only way they could afford to make the purchases.”
All major forms of consumer debt, including mortgages, auto loans and student loans, are at record highs, according to a report last week from the New York Fed, which has been tracking household debt since 2003. In total, Americans are shouldering $18.6 trillion in debt, a 3.6% uptick from a year ago. Within that, credit card debt has risen nearly 6% from a year ago to a record $1.2 trillion, the New York Fed reported last week.
Meanwhile, the rate of consumers who entered serious delinquency — meaning they’re at least 90 days late in making a debt payment — rose to more than 3% in the third quarter of this year. That’s the highest level in over a decade, according to New York Fed data.
The stress is most prominent for student loan payments, of which more than 14% became seriously delinquent last quarter, the highest level recorded dating back to when the regional reserve bank began tracking it in 2004.
It’s having a worrying effect on Americans’ finances:Credit scores fellby the most this year since the Great Recession. As an individual’s credit score declines, it generally becomes more expensive to finance any existing or new debt because lenders view the borrower as a greater risk. To compensate for that, they charge higher interest.
An intrinsic part of the American dream has long been owning a home, and it’s for good reason.
While renting has its advantages, the major upside of ownership is that over time property values tend to appreciate, which generates a stream of wealth that can be tapped into later in life, making it possible for people to retire.
Not to mention, there are also tax advantages to owning a home, such as the ability to deduct mortgage interest payments to lower your overall tax burden. No such equivalent exists for rent payments.
“Homeownership has been one of the most accessible ways for the average person to build wealth,” Schulz said. But with home prices and mortgage rates as high as they’ve been for several years, it’s become yet another financial choice that’s giving people pause."
Home Depot’s business is stuck. That’s a bad sign for the economy,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/home-depot-economy,"Nov 18, 2025, 6:44 AM ET","The housing market is frozen, and consumers arenervousabout the economy. That’s a bad recipe for Home Depot.
The bellwether for US consumers and the housing market said Tuesday that its sales at US stores open for at least one year rose only 0.2% last quarter. It also cut its profit forecast for the year.
Home Depot attributed the slowdown to consumers cutting back on remodeling projects and big home upgrades. Mortgage rates have been stuck between 6% and 7% in recent years, leading fewer people to buy and sell their homes.
“We believe that consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand,” Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said in a statement.
The company also said that fewer major storms and extreme weather events last quarter led to weaker customer demand for roofing materials, backup power generators and plywood.
Home Depot’s (HD) stock slipped 3% during pre-market trading Tuesday. Shares have dropped roughly 8% this year.
The company has also been grappling with President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported goods. Nearly half of Home Depot’s inventory comes from suppliers outside the United States.
In August, finance chief Richard McPhail said Home Depot would have to raise some prices as a result of the Trump administration’s taxes on imports.
“For some imported goods, tariff rates are significantly higher today than they were at this time last quarter,” he said in an interview with theWall Street Journal. “So as you would expect, there will be modest price movement in some categories, but it won’t be broad based.”"
Consumer spending stalled in September as inflation remained stubborn,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/economy/us-pce-consumer-spending-inflation-september,"Dec 5, 2025, 10:09 AM ET","The last piece of official inflation data to land before the Federal Reserve’s policymaking meeting next week was a shutdown-delayed report that showed the pace of price hikes remained stubborn in September and consumer spending waned after a summer splurge.
The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — the inflation gauge the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% target rate — rose 0.3% on a monthly basis, which lifted annual inflationfrom 2.7%to 2.8% in September, a rate last hit in April 2024, according to data released Friday by the Commerce Department.
Gas prices were on the high side in September, helping drive up overall inflation. Food prices also rose for the second month in a row.
However, energy and food prices can be quite volatile (and influenced by one-time factors), so the Fed also closely watches the core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, as a way to gauge underlying inflation trends.
The core PCE index rose 0.2% from the month before, which slowed the annual rate to 2.8% from 2.9%.
Friday’s data came in largely as anticipated: Economists were expecting inflation to rise 0.2% from August and tick higher to 2.8%, according to FactSet.
Sticky, stubbornly high inflation running at a 2.8% rate is still above the Fed’s 2% target; however, it remains likely that the central bank willmake another quarter-point cut at its policy meeting next week, said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet.
But, at this stage, the other side of the Fed’s price stability and full employment mandate warrants more monetary policy attention as the labor market continues to cool, she said.
Friday’s data is “certainly not going to stop them from cutting,” she said of central bank officials. “I think it’d be different if we saw inflation accelerating and picking up.”
Friday’s report was originally scheduled for release on Halloween; however, the federal government’s historic shutdown (which lasted the entirety of October and a dozen days into November), delayed the collection, tabulation and dissemination of a host of critical economic data.
Although seemingly stale, Friday’s data is the most comprehensive monthly report on pricing trends and how US households are earning, spending and saving.
Americans also reined in their purchases somewhat in September. Spending rose 0.3% that month after ticking up by 0.5% during each of the three previous months.
When taking inflation into account, spending was flat in September, the lowest monthly reading since real spending dipped 0.1% in May (when car sales slumped after a spring buying frenzyfueled by tariff fears).
The fundamentals supporting consumer spending weakened in September as well, Friday’s report showed: Inflation-adjusted disposable income rose just 0.1% for the month.
“A silent majority of consumers is increasingly strained by a two-year affordability crisis and elevated borrowing costs,” Gregory Daco, EY-Parthenon’s chief economist, wrote in a note on Friday. “Slower income growth is pushing many upper-median, median- and lower-income families to draw down savings and rely more heavily on credit to sustain their habits.”
While trading down has become the norm for many households, a lot of the spending activity – particularly on services and discretionary areas – is being driven by higher-income individuals, he said, referencing what’s been deemed a“K-shaped economy.”
Thehigher cost of living, after years of elevated inflation, continues to weigh heavily on Americans. Consumer sentiment has slumped amid the persistently high price environment as well as high levels of uncertainty related to steep tariffs and other sweeping actions from the Trump administration.
A separate report released Friday showed that consumer sentiment in early December rose 2.3 points to a preliminary reading of 53.3, according to the University of Michigan’s latest survey.
That was a bigger increase than economists had expected and showed that Americans saw “modest improvementsfrom Novemberon a few dimensions,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a release.
Still, sentiment remains historically weak, near record lows, and “consumers continue to cite the burden of high prices,” Hsu said.
The holidays and the promise of a new year tend to bolster Americans’ feelings about the economy and what lies ahead, NerdWallet’s Renter told CNN.
“I think people are optimistic and more willing to spend over the holidays and perhaps buck any negative sentiment they might be feeling at the time,” she said.
However, considering that the holidays can spur some irrational spending patterns, there does remain some concern about consumers’ financial health moving forward, she said.
“If they’re just amassing credit card debt and then getting behind on their payments, spending might not be all that great for the consumer,” she said.

The dirty secret of America’s holiday shopping season,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/business/holiday-shopping-economy-inflation,"Nov 25, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","Americans, enraged about years of rising prices, are going into the 2025 holiday shopping seasonprepared for battle. But this holiday shopping season could look a lot stronger than you’d expect – on paper, anyway.
How’s thatpossible?
High-income consumers keep spending like they’ve never heard of thisaffordability crisispeople keep talking about. But middle- and lower-income folks, despite declaring that they’refed up with their financial situations, are still spending, in aggregate. That’s prompting forecasts for flat or even slightly higher retail sales growth over 2024 – Mastercardforecastsa 3.6% rise in overall holiday spending this year.
But those folks are spending more in part because prices are higher. Stubborn inflation, combined with already-high prices, has forced people to shell out more for the holidays, pushing spending numbers up.
“Holiday shopping is far from full swing, but spending shifts are already surfacing,” said Vicki Hyman, communications director at Mastercard, in a recent report. “Inflation is expected to be a larger contributor to sales growth, as opposed to actual sales volume.”
That’s why holiday shopping data onBlack Fridayand beyond may give a somewhat rosy picture of the economy, even if headlines fail to expose the ugly side of the economy that has folks so furious.
“Low-income and high-income households are often living in two different worlds – and experiencing two different economies,” Joe Wadford, senior economist at Bank of America Institute, told CNN.
Black Friday through Christmas will test America’s economic strength. Preliminary reports look good: Early-bird holiday shoppers have been out in strong numbers this year, according to a report earlier this month from Bank of America.
Paychecks have grown fatter over the decade, and deposits into Bank of America accounts are higher now than they were in 2019, the bank said. That helped fuel a rise in credit and debit card spending overall, which grew 2.4% per household in October 2025 over October 2024, for the best month since February 2024. Spending has risen for five straight months, the bank said.
Shopping for holiday items was up an even stronger 5.7% over the past year in October.
But here’s the catch: That spending is measured in dollars, not items. The number of shopping transactions that Bank of America tracks has fallen slightly since January.
In other words: Inflation is taking a bite out of Americans’ shopping – and possibly their gift giving this year.
“Consumers are clearly spending more and getting less,” Wadford said.
Some of the spending figures may also be skewed bytariffs.
As Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs took shape, Americans rushed to buy items like electronics and jewelry so they could get ahead of the increase in prices. That may ultimately lead to lower spending on those items during the holiday season – because many people already bought what they wanted or because higher prices may dissuade some folks from making purchases during the holidays.
Another problem with aggregate holiday shopping reports is that they rarely tell youwhois doing the shopping. The details tend to paint a less glossy portrait of the economy than some of the headlines suggest.
For example, the Federal Reserve’s most recent Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes about the economy, showed consumer spending among low- and middle-income consumers is on the decline. They’re increasingly cash-strapped, and they’re looking for more discounts and promotions when they’re shopping.
Meanwhile, the Fed found high-end consumers are continuing to spend  – including on luxury items and travel.
That trend is starting to show up in holiday spending reports, too: Lower-income Americans have continued to spend – their credit and debit spending rose 0.7% last month over October 2024, far below annual inflation – Bank of America reported. But high-income Americans increased spending at more than triple that pace.
It’s part of the so-calledK-shaped economy, in which higher earners get a boost from their stock market investments and home valuations and use their fatter paychecks to spend. But lower earners increasinglylive paycheck to paycheckand look for discounts – or curtail their spending to cope with rising prices.
Those who make $170,000 and above are still spending like crazy – with double-digit growth this year, noted Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. But those with more moderate incomes, particularly those with low credit scores, are spending less than they were pre-pandemic.
Bank of America found that wages are only up 1% year-over-year for low-income families. But prices are up 3% as of the September inflation report.
“When your bills are up $300, but your wages are only up $100, what are you going to do?” Wadford said.
For those who are under financial stress, the pressure is mounting.
“It truly is a bifurcated economy,” American Express CEO Stephen Squeri said on an earnings call with Wall Street analysts last month. Squeri noted that American Express customers tend to spend more money than customers with other credit cards – which he attributed to the fact that Amex customers tend to be wealthier.
That’s similar to executives from other consumer brands, including Target, Walmart, Home Depot, Crocs, Chipotle and Coca-Cola, who all noted some degree of consumer pain among folks who make roughly $100,000 or less – and robust consumer spending among those who make more.
It’s one reason a poll published byFox Newsthis week showed 76% of Americans have a negative view of this economy, up from 67% in July.
“I would call it a K-shaped economy on steroids this holiday season,” said Long. “If you look at the gross spending and gross growth, it looks good. But if you break it down by average spend per cardholder it’s a totally different picture.”"
Trump announces plan to rescind Biden-era fuel-economy standards for vehicles,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/politics/fuel-economy-standards-rollback-trump,"Dec 3, 2025, 12:21 PM ET","President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled plans to rescind fuel-economy standards for vehicles put in place under the Biden administration.
“These policies forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices, and made the car much worse,” Trump said during an Oval Office event announcing the changes. “The action is expected to save the typical consumer at least $1,000 off the price of a new car, and we think substantially more than that.”
Top auto executives, including the CEOs of For﻿d and Stellantis, along with a General Motors plant manager, were in attendance at the event.
The Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, first established in 1975, set the average fuel economy targets for new vehicles. The Biden administration hadproposed modest increasesto the requirements for the vehicles most Americans drive as part of a push to promote electric vehicles and battle climate change.
Trump condemned the Biden policy as “anti-economy” on Wednesday, with Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy echoing similar criticisms.
“What Democrats were doing were not making cars more affordable. They were making them less affordable,” Duffy said in the Oval Office. “The consequence of that is going to be that more Americans can afford to buy a new car.”
The new standards, he said, will increase road safety and help automakers create new jobs.
“The more cars we sell, the more jobs we have in this country,” Duffy said.
In a statement ahead of the gathering, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised the administration’s move and emphasized the company’s support for revising federal requirements.
“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability. This is a win for customers and common sense,” Farley said.
Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa offered similar support, framing the changes as better aligned with consumer demand.
“Stellantis appreciates the Trump Administration’s actions to re-align the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards with real world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing US automotive industry. We look forward to working further with NHTSA on environmentally responsible policies that also allow us to offer our customers the freedom to choose the vehicles they want at prices they can afford,” Filosa said.

Why the world’s richest man and the CEO of the most valuable company met with Saudi officials,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/saudi-arabia-us-chips-ai-race,"Nov 19, 2025, 5:23 PM ET","Saudi Arabia is strengthening its ties with American AI companies — announcing a flurry of new joint ventures worth billions of dollars. The country seeks to make its mark in the AI industry as its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, makes his first visit to the United States in years.
Humain —an AI company backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund— announced a series of partnerships with prominent American tech companies, including xAI, Cisco, AMD and Qualcomm, during a US-Saudi investment forum in Washington on Wednesday.
Saudi Arabia is trying to further firm up ties with the United States and shift its economyaway from oil. For American companies, the Middle Eastern country answers three urgentproblems for AI expansion: funding, space and cheap energy.
Saudi Arabia is making a massive bet on becoming a global AI powerhouse
Elon Musk announced at Wednesday’s event that xAI,his AI company, will develop a huge data center in Saudi Arabia alongside Humain. The planned 500-megawatt data center would be xAI’s first large-scale center outside of the United States, and the partnership will see xAI’sGrok chatbotdeployed throughout Saudi Arabia.
“The future of intelligence will be engineered through massive and efficient compute combined with the most advanced AI models,” Musk said in a statement on Wednesday.
The center will be powered by chips from Nvidia, whose founder, Jensen Huang, sat alongside Musk and Saudi Arabian Minister of Communications and Information Technology Abdullah Alswaha at Wednesday’s panel. No further details about the partnership were revealed.
On Middle East tour, Trump touts US tech to power post-oil future
“This is how we walk the talk in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in partnership with the US,” Alswaha said. “Yesterday, the president and his royal highness announced the AI strategic framework and partnership. Today we’re going big with Elon and Jensen, so thank you for those opportunities.”
Bloombergreportedon Wednesday that the United States is set to approve the first sales of advanced AI chips to Humain.
At the event, Alswaha announced a 100-megawatt data center for Amazon Web Services “with a gigawatt ambition” that also will be powered by Nvidia’s infrastructure. AWS said in a statement that it plans “to provide, deploy and manage up to 150,000 AI accelerators” in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.
As AI companies expand, their huge data centers needspaceandmassive energy sources. Many data centers are being built in the United States, includingxAI’s Colossus in Memphis. However, there’s fear that China will beat out the United States when it comes toenergy productionto power AI systems. Saudi Arabia could help with that — it has much easier access to the space and energy needed to power these massive ventures.
Will ‘massive’ Gulf deals cement the US lead in the race for global AI dominance?
The investment from Saudi Arabia also plays a major part in Prince bin Salman’s redemption in the United States, following being labeled a “pariah” byPresident Joe Bidenfor his role in the killing ofWashington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
During his Oval Office visit on Wednesday, Prince bin Salman claimed the country will be investing $1 trillion dollars in the United States, a substantial increase from the previously announced $600 billion investment in May. The comments surprised even President Donald Trump in the moment, although the timeline of the investments is not clear.
“You’re saying to me now that the $600 billion will be $1 trillion?” Trump said to Prince bin Salman in the Oval Office. “Good. I like that very much.”"
Trump’s first problem on the economy and health care: admitting he’s got a problem,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/08/politics/trump-economy-health-care-problem-analysis,"Dec 8, 2025, 12:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump has a fresh chance this week to act on a priority voters continually say they want fixed — but over which he’s in denial.
Thehigh and rising pricesof health care, groceries and housing are a leading impediment to the lives of millions of Americans. But Trump, not unusually for presidents, seems more interested in his own political goals and obsessions.
Americans wracked by economic insecurity can’t wait. Nor can Republican lawmakers, who fear the president’s response — which is largely to blame his predecessor Joe Biden — will doom their reelection chances next year.
“Every bill we bring to the floor should be focused on lowering the cost of living for people who need it most,” Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, one of the most at-risk Republicans in the 2026 midterms,told CNN’s “Inside Politics Sunday.”
The Senate is expected to vote as soon as this week on whether to extend expiring subsidies on Affordable Care Act programs as part of last month’s deal to end the government shutdown. If Congress doesn’t act, millionswill face a choicebetween much higher premiums or simply going without coverage.
Trump meanwhile is expected to hold an event in Pennsylvania on making prices more affordable, as his administration faces increasing pressure to demonstrate it understands an issue that was instrumental in his election last year.
The prospects of decisive action this week on either score are low, however.
A plan to address Republican qualms while extending enhanced subsidies without major reforms to Obamacaredoesn’t yet exist. And even if the Senate finds a compromise, there’s little appetite among Republicans in Speaker Mike Johnson’s narrow House majority to save a law they’ve always hated.
Trump fumes even at the word “affordability” — regarding it as a Democratic “hoax” — and is wallowing in denial about an economy that he claims has entered a “golden age” but that is making many working- and middle-class Americans feel poorer. And while Trump has taken some steps totry to lower costs— of certain prescription drugs, for example — his wider policies may be making the situation worse.
The administration tacitly admitted as much when it recentlycut import dutieson coffee, bananas and other staples to ease the pain of consumers.
“As a nation, we have much to be grateful for this holiday season,” Trump said while lighting the National Christmas Tree last week, proclaiming big wins on the border, national security and ending wars. He also said, “Our economy is thriving, inflation has stopped, our nation is strong, and America is back bigger and better, stronger, better than ever before.” This may be one issue where the president’s talent for branding can’t get him out of a political hole.
A CNN/SSRS poll last month found 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” A recent CBS survey found only 36% approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, a onetime strength.
The contradiction between the president’s claims of success and the lived experience of many Americans raises the question of whether Trump, a billionaire, and his wealthy Cabinet have lost touch with what the country is feeling.
The fight over health care is the most urgent and visible clash in the affordability crisis.
If the enhanced subsidies expire at the end of the year, enrollees will face payments that many can’t afford — doubling from $888 to $1,904 next year on average,according to a new pollfrom KFF, a nonpartisan health policy group.
The stark politics of this issue for Republicans explain why Democrats picked the subsidies as the trigger for the government shutdown. They failed to achieve their goal, but highlighted the catch-22 of GOP lawmakers who want to kill Obamacare but whose success would hurt millions of their voters who rely on the program.
Some Republicans are pushing to extend the subsidies, to give them time to draw up a more permanent replacement health care plan. Others want reform before agreeing to an extension. But then the question becomes how to help Americans who suddenly find themselves with premiums they can’t afford.
The conundrum was encapsulated by Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
“Just to extend three years something that has not been working that was meant to be temporary from the beginning is not a good vote,” Curtis told Dana Bash.
“We need a minimum premium for people, even if it’s a couple of bucks. We know we need a cap on income,” he said. “How do we actually lower the cost, not just of insurance, but of health care? And then what do we do in the interim while we’re waiting to do that?”
As Curtis implied, the chances of a workable reform to Obamacare in the few days Congress is in session before the holidays seem remote.
Meanwhile, most people have already been forced to make their health care budget decisions for next year. This is why some Republicans say a vote to extend subsidies is the only answer. “If you don’t have a better plan, then get on board with ours,” Fitzpatrick told CNN’s Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.”
Trump has hardly helped the situation. He has repeatedly failed to lay down a blueprint or to take the complexities of the health insurance market seriously during two presidential terms. He did vaguely suggest that Congress should set up health savings accounts but has put no political muscle behind it. The White House also recentlypulled back a planto extend subsidies amid GOP opposition. Democrats are meanwhile salivating at the prospect of highlighting health care costs in campaign ads they can aim at swing-seat voters next year.
The president is expected to head to Pennsylvania, a state he won in 2024, this week to show solidarity with voters fed up with high prices. But he seems unlikely to ease his political situation, or the economic well-being of working Americans by talking about it. He is resistant to accepting the issue’s political potency. And in the past, he’s struggled to stick to a script and mocked advisers who suggest he needs to show economic empathy.
“They wanted to do a speech on the economy, so we are doing this as an intellectual speech. You are all intellectuals today,” he told a crowd in North Carolina in 2024.
Trump has always been more of a cheerleader than a feel-your-pain president. Yet his transformation of the Republican Party into a populist movement was rooted in his intimate connection with many White, working-class voters who felt deserted — culturally and economically by Democrats. But Trump doesn’t seem ready to commit to any strategy that accepts his second term is not a roaring triumph.
“Our country is wealthy again and secure again,” he said during a Cabinet meeting last week. “There’s this fake narrative that the Democrats talk about affordability. They just say the word, it doesn’t mean anything to anybody, just say, ‘affordability.’” Trump may have a point here, although next year, newly elected Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia must live up to campaign promises to cut prices similar to ones the president made in 2024.
Trump is also correct to say that inflation spiked under Biden. But his claims that he has halted the inflation rate are not true. It recentlyticked up to 2.8%, meaning the rate at which prices are going up is still rising. And an administration that takes pains to court corporations and the oligarchs of the tech industry is yet to convince working Americans it cares as much about them.
Trump’s frequent announcements of billions of dollars in investment in the US by foreign companies and states do look good — even if theydon’t always live upto his billing. And even if such projects come off, they’ll be a long-term proposition and won’t ease prices quickly. Trump’s pledge to appoint anew Federal Reserve chairwho will cut interest rates faster could lower mortgage rates and stimulate the housing market. But it could also unleash a new inflation crisis.
While Trump insists everything is great now, some subordinates, including Vice President JD Vance, who as a potential future GOP presidential candidate must not alienate voters, are more nuanced in recognizing some Americans are hurting. But Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had a sunny prediction on Sunday. “The economy has been better than we thought,” he told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Lashing out at “embedded inflation” left over from the Biden administration, he said: “I think, next year, we’re going to move on to prosperity.”
But voters have heard blame games and optimism before. Successive elections have failed to deliver tangible change. Affordability is a defining issue, that does exist, no matter what Trump says, and it’s become a curse of incumbents."
"The US economy added 119,000 jobs in September, but unemployment rose to a nearly four-year high",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/economy/us-jobs-report-september-final,"Nov 20, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Along-awaited jobs reportoffered a mixed picture of the US labor market.
The economy added 119,000 jobs in September, an unexpected rebound for the labor market — but it comes as the overall economy shows signs of slowing. However, the unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, the highest it’s been in nearly four years.
Economists were expecting 50,000 jobs to have been added and an unemployment rate that remained at 4.3%, according to FactSet.
Delayed for seven weeks due to the government shutdown, the latest snapshot of America’s job market showed that unemployment rose in September to the highest level in nearly four years.
In addition, August’s tepid job gains of 22,000 were revised to a job loss of 4,000 jobs and July was revised down by 7,000 jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday.
The health care and social assistance sector continued to drive overall employment growth. Those sectors added an estimated 57,100 jobs in September, accounting for nearly half of the overall gains. Leisure and hospitality contributed 47,000 jobs during a month with unseasonably warm weather.
Jobs were lost in sectors such as transportation and warehousing (-25,300), temporary help services (-15,900) and manufacturing (-6,000).
Although the September employment data has been on the shelf since early October,it provides a critical snapshotof the labor market at a time when tariffs, stubborn inflation and elevated interest rates continue to slow the US economy.
Plus, Thursday’s report might very well be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since theshutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during Octoberand part of November. The BLS on Wednesday announced that there will not be a separate October jobs report published but instead some of that data will be included in the November report scheduled for December 16.
Despite the stronger-than-expected September gains, this year is still on pace for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.
“The job market was really weak in the summer, and it didn’t improve much in September,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Credit Union. “What we learned today is that both June and August had negative job growth, so, shedding jobs; 119,000 is pretty good for September, but when you step back, the average (monthly job gain) of the past four months is in the low 40,000s.”
“So, it looks very weak,” she added.
Unemployment, a closely watched recession indicator, ticked higher in September, rising to the highest rate since October 2021.
However, driving the jobless rate higher was an increase in the labor force – primarily an uplift in more people looking for work, versus a sharp increase in layoffs, BLS data shows.
The job gains remain heavily concentrated. Two sectors – health care and social assistance, and leisure and hospitality – accounted for 87% of September’s job growth.
But in a labor market that’s been in a low-hire, low-fire slog, there are also few opportunities for those seeking work. On average, it’s taking people six months to find work, according to the latest BLS data.
The latest unemployment claims data supports that trend: In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that an estimated 1.974 million people filed continuing claims for unemployment insurance for the week ended November 8, hitting a fresh four-year high.
Initial claims, which are considered the best proxy for layoff activity, fell to 220,000 last week, remaining well below more concerning thresholds (300,000 to 400,000 range, consistently).
“If I had to characterize it, it still looks a lot like ‘no-hire, no-fire,’” Long said. “I do worry, given the number of industries that are starting to fire, that this is starting to look like ‘no-hire, start-to-fire.’”
Despite the mixed bag of data, the September report “could throw cold water” on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates further when it meets in December, Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, wrote in a note on Thursday.
“The sharp rebound in employment gains, up 119,000 in September following the downwardly revised negative 4,000 print in August soothes concerns that the labor market was on the precipice of a large downturn and removes urgency for another rate cut,” she wrote.
Still, because of the historic government shutdown, the September jobs report will be the freshest official monthly employment snapshot available when the Fed makes its next interest rate decision on December 10. The partial October and full November data won’t come out until the following week."
Big Tech keeps splurging on AI. The pressure is ramping up to show why,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/tech/microsoft-amazon-meta-google-earnings-ai,"Oct 31, 2025, 10:05 AM ET","Silicon Valley’s mega AI spending spree isn’t slowing down anytime soon. But Wall Street’s patience to see a return might be wearing a little thin.
That message rang clear when Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet all said this week that they’re forking over moreon capital expenditures, likeleases and equipment for data centers and infrastructure.
Based on the way analysts grilled executives from companies like Meta, Alphabet and Google on earnings calls this week, they’re eager for signs that these massive investments will pay off in a big way.
Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all grew their overall revenue year-over-year and surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. Microsoft and Google saw their cloud businesses expand by 40% and 34% respectively, while Amazon Web Services sales grew 20% year-over-year – a sign that companies are indeed relying on their services in the age of AI.
And they’re continuing to pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and data centers, an investment they call necessary for the internet’s next era.
The dollar amounts involved are staggering.
Google expects tospend $91 to $93 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, up from the $85 billion it previously forecast. Microsoft sees that spendingup 74%, to $34.9 billion this year, largely lining up with the more than $30 billion it predicted for the quarter. Meta spent $19.37 billion, up from $9.2 billion a year ago and more than the $18.4 billion analysts expected.
And Amazon estimates the 2025 bill will hit $125 billion – andexpects to increase that in 2026.
Even Apple, which is not a major cloud provider, expects to increase its capital expenditure spending related to AI investments, Apple Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said on the company’s Thursday earnings call.
Existing data centers need to be upgraded to handle AI workloads, leading to the giant outlays, said Melissa Otto, head of research for investment research service S&P Global Visible Alpha.
Tech giants justify that spending by saying demand is outstripping supply. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “as fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”
But Wall Street wants more than just promises of future returns. Meta shares fell as much as 13.5% on Thursday, while Microsoft’s were down more than 3%.
Nearly every question on Meta’s earnings call focused on how the company views its AI investments translating into income, the timeline for new products and models coming out of its Superintelligence Lab and its general approach to AI.
Zuckerberg called AI useful for powering virtual assistants and helping advertisers plan their campaigns. More than a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis, he said, adding that AI can lead to “all kinds of new products around different content formats.”
“We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it,” he said about the Superintelligence Lab’s efforts.
On the Microsoft call, analysts wanted to know if clients will make good on promised purchasing commitments and whether the tech industry can really make money from global AI investments. Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said its investments reflect business that’s already been booked, saying that demand is increasing.
Google investors wanted to know how AI summaries and agents are changing how the company makes money from search. Google’s chief business officer said the company makes about the same money from adsbelow and within the AI responses as with traditional search.
The answers satisfied some analysts; UBS said it maintains its “conviction that AI-related stocks should drive further equity performance,” while CFRA Research said it came away from the quarter “more optimistic” about Google’s core business and that Meta “remains committed to becoming the leading AI lab.” Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives said Microsoft is “hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front.”
But that’s as long as they keep growing the products that catapulted them to become the world’s largest tech companies in the first place. Investors are more likely to raise their eyebrows at all this spending if customers start shying away from Meta’s social media apps or Google’s search engine, according to Otto.
“You’re seeing a pressure to accelerate innovation,” said SuRo Capital’s Evan Schlossman. “You have new space in AI that people believe will be extremely valuable, and so there is a rush to sort of fill that void.”"
"So long, peak oil: World demand could now grow until 2050, a top agency says",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/oil-demand-2050-iea-intl,"Nov 12, 2025, 10:12 AM ET","Global demand for oil and natural gas could grow until 2050, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, departing from previous expectations of a speedy transition to cleaner fuels following UScriticism of its climate focus.
The IEA also predicted in its annual outlook that the world would likely fail to meet its goal to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change.
The Paris-based energy security watchdog has been under pressure from the United States for a shift in recent years toward a focus on clean energy policies as President Donald Trump called on American companies to expand oil and gas production.
During the Biden administration, the IEA predicted that global oil demand would peak this decade and said there should be an end to investment in new oil, gas and coal projects if the world wanted to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century.
Trump’s Energy Secretary Chris Wright has called the IEA’s demand peak projections “nonsensical.” The agency is funded by member countries, with the US the largest contributor.
In its World Energy Outlook published Wednesday, the IEA predicted that under a “current policies scenario” oil demand would hit 113 million barrels per day by mid-century, up around 13% from 2024 consumption.
The scenario – which the IEA first used in 2019 before switching to one more in line with a clean energy transition – is based on existing government policies and not aspirations to achieve climate goals.
IEA head Fatih Birol said on a press call the scenario had been restored to reflect differing choices governments were making about energy.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has previously disputed peak oil demand forecasts.
“We hope… we have passed the peak in the misguided notion of ‘peak oil.’” OPEC said on its website Wednesday.
In the IEA’s “stated policies scenario,” which considers proposed but not necessarily adopted policies, oil demand peaks around 2030.
The agency says its scenarios explore a range of possible outcomes under various sets of assumptions and are not forecasts.
Final investment decisions for new liquefied natural gas projects have surged in 2025, the report noted. Operations for about 300 billion cubic meters of new annual LNG export capacity will start by 2030, marking a 50% increase in available supply.
Based on the current policies scenario, the global LNG market increases from around 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035 and to 1,020 bcm in 2050, driven by rising power sector demand fueled by data center and artificial intelligence growth.
Global investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion in 2025, the report said, noting that if achieved this would surpass the $540 billion a year spent globally on oil supply.
The report includes a scenario describing a pathway to reduce global energy emissions to net zero by 2050.
More than 190 countries pledged at the Paris climate talks in 2015 to try to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
But the report shows the world surpassing that in all scenarios."
Trump is right: He lowered some of your costs. But he also made many prices higher,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/business/trump-prices-affordability,"Nov 17, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","President Donald Trump keepsdownplaying America’s affordability crisis, and he continues to falsely claim that inflation and overall prices have fallen during his second term.
“Our prices are coming down very substantially on groceries and things,” Trump told reporters in Florida Sunday evening. “They’re already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.”
The truth is annualinflation stood at 3%in September. Grocery prices havegained 1.4%between January and September, and US consumer prices haverisen 1.7%on average during Trump’s second term, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But that’s just an average. Look a little more closely, and Trump really can claim credit forsomefalling prices. But he is also to blame for somerisingprices.
A complex mix of factors determines the price of any particular item.As anyone who took Econ 101 remembers, supply and demand remain the primary influences over consumer prices. But commodity costs, wholesale prices, transportation and fuel concerns, regulations, labor and a whole host of other considerations can weigh on what people ultimately pay at the store.
But Trump’s policies, perhaps more than any president’s in recent memory, have directly influenced the prices on thousands of consumer goods – both lower and higher.
Drugs:Pharmaceuticals remain the the most prominent example of Trump directly influencing prices lower. Trump has put significant pressure on drugmakers to lower prices, and many have followed suit.
Most recently, Trump and his administration announced that certainblockbuster obesity drugswill be available for as little as $149 per month, significantly lower than the list prices, which can top $1,000. Trump has also announced deals withPfizer,AstraZenecaand others to set prices of new medications at“Most Favored Nation”levels, the lowest price made available in peer countries.
Eggs:When Trump took office, egg prices had been surging because a deadly avian flu epidemic devastated the egg-laying hen population. Egg prices peaked above$8 a dozen in late Februaryafter rising steadily over the previous year.
A couple weeks into Trump’s term, hisUSDA announced an initiativeto lower prices by increasing biosecurity on egg-laying farms, providing aid to farmers who lost flocks and temporarily lifting restrictions on egg imports. The plan worked: Egg prices have since fallen to just over $2 a dozen.
Oil:Trump dismantled many oil drilling regulations that he claimed would expand US oil production – but, so far at least, that hasn’t made any meaningful difference. Trump, however, publicly pressured OPEC+ on prices, and though the group of oil-producing nations denied Trump had anything to do with its decision, OPEC+ boosted production several times this year, and US oil fell below $60 a barrel – down from $75 when Trump took office.
Industry experts havepartially attributedOPEC’s decision to Trump’s influence, although they also say OPEC’s hand may have been forced by nations that acted independently of the group. And oil prices have ebbed and flowed with sinking demand and on-and-off Middle East conflicts throughout the year, as well.
Trump has also announced some policies that could have long-term benefits for consumers but whose effects remain to be seen.
Beef and fruit:Last week, Trump signed executive orders thatlowered tariffson imported beef and other produce that mostly grows overseas. That could lower some of those prices, but the tariff cuts largely justrestore import prices to where they werebefore Trump launched his sweeping trade war.
Cars:Trump’s domestic policy and tax billdid away with a number of financial penaltieson automakers that fail to meet fuel efficiency rules. That is saving some US automakers billions of dollars a year and could cut the cost of building a vehicle by 3% to 5%, according to Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities. But that may not translate to lower consumer prices because Trump also raised tariff costs on automakers.
Tariffs:By far the largest price increase on consumers that Trump has imposed came in the form of his sweeping tariffs on virtually every foreign country’s goods. That has raised the effective US tariff rate to 13.6%, up from 1.2% in 2024 – a gigantic tax increase that has raised the average American household’s costs this year by $1,200, according to the conservative-leaningTax Foundation.
The calculation is tricky, because tariffs are paid by US importers who typically pass those costs onto wholesalers, retailers and eventually consumers. JPMorgan this month estimated that consumers are currently paying about 20% of tariffs’ costs, but many businesses have announced they can no longer afford to eat those expenses and will soon be forced to raise consumer prices. That’s why the Tax Foundation estimates the average household’s annual costs will rise by $1,600 because of Trump’s tariffs next year.
Benefits cuts:Historiccuts to America’s safety net programs, including Medicaid and food stamps, will raise out-of-pocket expenses for the country’s neediest: Those earning less than $18,000 a year will have to spend more than 1% more going forward because of Trump’s tax and spending policy bill, according toPenn Wharton
The bill also cut some popular tax credits, including the$7,500that the government chipped in when customers bought electric vehicles.
America’s debt:Trump’s massive tax cut and spending bill will add nearly $4 trillion to America’s $36 trillion in debt, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. That briefly sent the bond market into a tizzy in May, leading US Treasury yields﻿, which trade in opposite direction to prices, significantly higher. Investors had effectively sent a warning that they may be unwilling to keep funding the government’s coffers unless they get paid more for it.
Yields have since come down – but not by a ton. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which influences mortgage, credit card and auto loan rates, remains above 4.1%.
Trump’s spending and economic policies have also hurt the dollar, which has fallen more than 8% this year. That can boost the appeal of US-made goods abroad, but it also makes foreign goods more expensive for Americans.
Meanwhile, Trump has effectively tried to will lower prices into existence,recently callingAmerica’s affordability crisis a “lie” and a “complete con job.” The White House, while casting blame elsewhere, acknowledged it has some work to do.
“The Trump Administration will not rest until the high prices that resulted from Democrat policies are fully reined in,” the White House said in a statement Friday. “We’re making progress — and the best is yet to come.”"
China used its trade juggernaut to withstand US tariffs. Can it keep its edge?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/14/china/china-us-trade-war-global-exports-intl-hnk-dst,"Nov 14, 2025, 7:37 PM ET","As US duties on Chinese imports spun higher and higher earlier this year, Derek Wang braced for major disruption.
With US orders ground to a halt, Wang, 36, who sells intelligent cookware out of southern China’s Guangdong province, looked elsewhere to fill the gap. After finding new buyers in Brazil, Japan, Malaysia and Cambodia, he learned what he describes as a key lesson: “Nothing is more important than the markets close to us.”
Stories like Wang’s have played out across China’s vast economy where businesses, large and small, scrambled to fill the void after temporary triple-digit duties – and the threat of their return – upended Chinese exports to the world’s wealthiest market.
The result has been a coup for China’s trade juggernaut.
Instead of seeing exports falter on lost US business, the world’s largest manufacturer has driven them deeper into other markets around the world – building on the country’s global economic footprint and hedges companies made during Trump’s first trade war.
The resilience gave Beijing confidence in its months-long negotiations with the US, which came to a head in October when leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met and agreed to a truce that whittles new tariffs on Chinese goods down to 20%.
But the push also puts China on track to eclipse last year’s gaping nearly $1 trillion global trade surplus – a balance that’s irritated governments around the world and sparked Trump’s trade war in the first place.
There were already questions about the sustainability of China’s export blitz before data released last week showed exports unexpectedly contracted by just over 1% year on year in October – the first downturn since February.
Whether China can maintain its level of exports to the rest of the world – and expand back into the US market after the recent truce, is a consequential question for the world’s second-largest economy as it continues to struggle with lackluster demand from its own consumers, but doubles down on manufacturing as its economic cornerstone.
So far this year, the shift in China’s export flows has been stark – and sent a clear message that, for China, the US is not irreplaceable.
While exports to the US dropped nearly 18% in the first 10 months of this year versus that period in 2024, they were up more than 7% to the European Union, 14% to countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and 26% to Africa, according to Chinese customs data released last week. Overall, exports rose 5.3%.
In Southeast Asia, that trade was buoyed by leaps in the export of machine tools, automobile parts and computer components. In Africa, construction machinery and green technologies have been key exports, analysts say, while parts of Latin America have seen significant growth in electric vehicles, chemical fertilizers and electronics, among other areas.
This trade engine was humming before the start of the trade war.
Already the world’s manufacturing superpower, China’s rapid climb to dominate green technologies like EVs, lithium-ion batteries, and solar panels, had driven up demand from countries looking to convert to renewable energy cheaply – and concern from those accusing China of unfair competition with subsidized products.
Some of those goods – like EVs and solar panels – were already effectively barred from the US market by high tariffs put in place in recent years, and China’s exporters have been building out trade across developing markets.
“(China) has prepared quite well for this,” said Jacob Gunter, who heads the economy and industry program at the MERICS think tank in Berlin.
“It wasn’t some miracle of foresight thinking to predict that the United States would escalate over time its trade and technology conflict with China, but China was (expanding markets) before the trade and tech war began, and ever since it’s started, that trend has really accelerated,” he said.
Even as many companies had to scramble to divert business from the US market in recent months, experts say the groundwork for the pivot was laid by Beijing’s decades-long push to build out its global economic footprint – expanding trade while also bankrolling ports, terminals and highways under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative.
It’s also relied on an earlier push from Chinese firms to move supply chains and production centers out of China to areas from Southeast Asia to Mexico – where goods are shipped from China to be fabricated or finished.
“That’s the key for the so-called resilience of Chinese exports,” said Yao Yang, dean of the Di-shui-hu Advanced Finance Institute at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, who noted these investments began during Trump’s first term.
“Without those outbound investments, I don’t think that China can cope with the shock.”
But Beijing’s trade resilience has also raised fears that a deluge of Chinese goods into other markets will wipe out domestic industries.
Countries have been hitting back with probes on Chinese goods, with the US and India, as well as Mexico and Brazil, together raising 79 anti-dumping and countervailing probes against Chinese goods in the first half of this year – a significant uptick from recent years before 2024, according to World Trade Organization data.
There’s also calls for exports or factory relocations to come alongside greater levels of local investment, knowledge transfer and more balanced trade.
For some Latin American countries, “deindustrialization is a big problem when Chinese companies start to invest … because they bring just the assembly, they don’t do technology and knowledge transfer,” said Diego Rodriguez, logistics and industrial practice leader at Americas Market Intelligence, a research firm in Miami, noting countries like Brazil are pushing back against this.
In Southeast Asia, the stronger flow of goods is a concern, according to Rebecca Sta Maria, former executive director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation secretariat.
“We feel as if we are being swamped. I remember one economy saying a ‘tsunami of Chinese goods coming into ASEAN.’ Of course that’s a concern to us,” said Sta Maria, now the director of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. But it wasn’t all negative, she added, because small and medium-sized businesses were using high-end components from China, making their products more competitive.
“I know that the Chinese government has acknowledged (the concern) to some extent, so now it’s how do we manage this?”
Beijing denies accusations that its goods are flooding markets. Its officials have instead taken Trump’s global trade shake-up as an opportunity to tout China as the reliable trade partner, while pledging to open its vast market wider to exporters and investors from around the world.
Observers say some countries may also be unwilling to throw up barriers to China at a time when they are facing higher tariffs on their own goods into the US – that’s especially when there is true demand in many countries.
In Africa, “it’s a two-way street,” said Capital Economics emerging market analyst David Omojomolo.
“These countries (in Africa) want to industrialize… there’s a massive electricity gap across the continent – solar panels are cheap and China’s got overcapacity … they need to send them somewhere, so of course, Africa is going to benefit.”
Even still, manufacturers across China have struggled to fill the hole left by the drop in US exports.
Factory employees in recent months have described to CNN canceled shifts, mandatory furloughs and lost jobs as employers deciding to relocate out of China.
Garment maker Zhang Peipei in Jiangxi province told CNN she has been able to keep her 20-year-old business afloat through smaller revenue streams coming from outside the US. But she says the unpredictable US tariff policies have already caused “serious and irreversible long-term impact” without clear alternatives.
With her business now hanging on whether she can cut a deal with buyers in Mexico, Zhang said she didn’t feel “very confident,” even despite a potential return of some US business now, “since the US has been shaking up the foreign trade scene, the whole world is chaotic right now.”
And there are questions about whether China’s robust trade data this year showed true demand or a short-term push to get goods out of the country to stockpile them or ship them to the US via a third country with lower tariffs.
An analysis of US and Chinese trade data from April to July – including the height of the trade uncertainty – suggests that just less than a quarter of China’s trade diverted from the US was likely still ultimately ending up in the US, while the rest of the goods were finding alternative markets, according to Gerard DiPippo, a senior researcher at the RAND China Research Center.
“Still, l’m not all that confident that the final demand for all those (other) exports going to the Global South is actually going to be remaining in those countries,” he said, noting that exporters could also be building up offshore inventories as they waited to see how countries’ trade talks with the US played out.
“The big caveat,” he added, is that “the margins of Chinese exporters are almost certainly getting squeezed … they’re maintaining high volumes in real terms, but they’re doing it by cutting prices.”
The recent truce between Xi and Trump leaves tariffs on Chinese goods at around 47% on average, but could see the return of more US business.
But as uncertainty remains across the global economy, a driving focus for those in China, both in the factories and the government, will be on expanding how much the country’s own consumers buy domestic-made goods.
That’s the case for Wang, the cookware maker in Guangdong. Despite finding new clients outside the US, he is also making another pivot, directing more of his business to China’s domestic market, and less of it outside, he said."
Trump’s undeniable stock market victory that no one saw coming,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/markets/us-stock-market,"Nov 4, 2025, 6:30 AM ET","One year after President Donald Trump’s reelection, the US stock market continues to notchrecord highs.
The S&P 500 has gained 19.6% over the past 12 months, boosted by strong corporate earnings and investors’ enthusiasm about artificial intelligence. Stocks have been remarkably adaptable, defying concerns about a resurgence in global trade tensions and bouts of intense volatility.
To Trump, the market’s gains are a vindication of his policies. The president on October 28 touted stocks’ record highs during a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.
“Their stock market today and our stock market today hit an all-time high,” Trumpsaid. “That means we’re doing something right.”
But some analysts say the stock market’s gains have a more prosaic reason: Corporate earnings continue to impress Wall Street, and investors are betting big on AI.
“What happens in Washington matters, but it’s not the only thing that matters,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist. “Despite all the shifting narratives, the key theme for this year is the dominance of tech and AI and the continued resilience of corporate America.”
The stock market’s resilience has been surprising, said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management, considering Trump’s “pretty aggressive changes and approaches” to US trade policy and the Federal Reserve, which he has pressured to lower interest rates.
“Trump’s introduced a lot of uncertainty into markets over the last year,” Ellerbroek said. “The market hates uncertainty.”
Investors have turned their attention to the AI trade and tried to look past concerns about tariffs, he said.
“This AI investment cycle is humongous and unprecedented and overwhelming any and all of those things,” Ellerbroek said.
The S&P 500, which is weighted by market value, has become increasingly concentrated in big tech companies. Nvidia (NVDA), which just hit$5 trillionin market value, now accounts for 8% of the S&P 500’s market value.
An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500, which gives all the companies in the index an equal part, is up just 6% over the past 12 months, compared to the benchmark index’s 19.6% gain.
The S&P 500 fell as much as 19% in April as Trump rolled out hisplan for tariffs. But as markets tumbled, the Trump administration walked back its most severe proposals.
Since then, the S&P 500 has coasted higher. The index is up six months in a row.
“Stocks may be higher in part because the administration’s final tariff actions were ultimately less severe than initially feared,” said Mark Malek, CIO at brokerage firm Siebert Financial. “Were it not for the tariff-driven swoon earlier this year, markets would likely be even higher today.”
From Trump’s election through the end of October, the S&P 500’s rise was the eighth best for a president’s first year since the end of World War II, according to CFRA Research data. The S&P 500 climbed roughly 38% during the same period during President Joe Biden’s term, marking the best performance on record.
Meanwhile, the US stock market’s gains this year pale in comparison to global markets. In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi index has soared 66% across the past 12 months. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has gained 28%. Benchmark stock indexes in Poland and Greece have gained roughly 52% and 60%, respectively.
The US stock market’s rollercoaster ride since Trump took office
While stocks are near record highs, the Treasury market has also advanced. Despite concerns about US deficits, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and attacks on the Fed’s independence, investors have still flocked to US government bonds.
The 10-year US Treasury yield, which influences a host of interest rates across the economy, has declined from 4.4% in November 2024 to 4.1% this month.
Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, has signaled relative calm in markets for the majority of the past six months. An index tracking volatility in the bond market is hovering near its lowest level this year.
“We want the most America-first policies that are possible, without incurring market wrath,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Financial Times in October.
“What gets the people in trouble is they come in, they have these ideas, but they don’t respect the market,” Bessent said. “You’ve got to respect the market.”
When Trump was reelected,investors cheeredthe potential for deregulation and tax cuts, while the Fed had recently cut interest rates, providing a boost for stocks.
Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, said he has not been surprised by the stock market’s ascent.
“The administration has largely delivered on a lot of those things that investors were so bullish about,” Mayfield said.
“Ultimately you zoom back and you say, ‘All right, it’s an AI bull market,’” Mayfield said. “The administration took the baton from the last administration only two years into a bull market, still with a lot of leg room left and companies growing their earnings.”
OpenAI wants to build the next era of the web, and it’s shelling out billions to do it
Mayfield said he expects the rally to continue, but he is also cautious about a potential pullback, given just how far things have run.
“I don’t expect a smooth ride,” he said. “I would expect a correction at some point in the next 12 months — 10% to 15% maybe.”
A growing chorus of Wall Street CEOs concurs: David Solomon, chief executive at Goldman Sachs, said he thinks there will be a 10% to 20% drawdown in stocks sometime in the next one to two years.
“Things run and they pull back so people can reassess,” Solomon said during a panel at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit in Hong Kong.
While the S&P 500 continues to hit record highs, the index is being carried by big tech and AI. It leaves everyday investors and 401(k)s increasingly exposed to enormous gains, but vulnerable to a downturn.
To Lerner at Truist, the bull market deserves the benefit of the doubt.
“The North Star of this bull market is corporate profits,” Lerner said.
But with stocks trading at historically expensive levels, there are risks abound.
“When you haven’t had a pullback since April, I think you’re just more susceptible to negative surprises, whatever those may be,” Lerner said. “You might be somewhat less able to absorb them.”"
The secret behind your skyrocketing energy costs,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/climate/electricity-bills-high-infrastructure-wires-demand-cost,"Dec 4, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","Stephanie Tate couldn’t figure it out. After three years of living in her new Illinois home, her winter energy costs last year suddenly spiked to $400 per month.
She had three different technicians come to look at her HVAC system and furnace, but nothing was wrong with it. She had her home insulation inspected and found no issues. She installed new, energy efficient windows to stop cold air from leaking into the house.
“It still didn’t make a dent,” she said.
In the summer, her bills were even higher, driven by the cost of the electricity needed to run her air conditioner. Tate tried to use her heat and cooling sparingly in hot and cold months.
“In the winter, I keep my heat well below 68 — and it gets cold here, so you just bundle up,” Tate said. “In the summer, my AC is at 75. I’m dealing with a little warm weather inside my house.”
Diving into her bills, Tate found something surprising. Her electricity bill’s delivery fees — the costs customers pay to help maintain electric infrastructure like the poles and wires carrying power to their homes — were often just as high as the cost of the electricity she used.
What goes into your skyrocketing energy bills
“That’s ridiculous,” she said. “You’re paying more for everything right now, and the electrical costs — the way they increase so exponentially and so quickly is stunning to me.”
Around the country, customers like Tate are getting sticker shock when they open their monthly utility bills. Since last September, residential electricity rates nationwide increased by 7.4%, according to the federalEnergy Information Administration. Tate’s home state of Illinois had the third-highest increase nationwide, with a 20.6% jump year-over-year, behind the District of Columbia and New Jersey.
And electricity rates themselves — a bill’s “supply charges,” — don’t explain the total increase, because they don’t include those electric infrastructure “delivery charges” like Tate found.
Cost increases in Tate’s area are largely about the cost of generating electricity, said a spokesperson for Ameren, the Illinois and Missouri-based utility that Tate uses. The company doesn’t generate power itself in Illinois, and has to buy it from third-party suppliers, which can result in big price fluctuations during high-demand times, like summer.
But, like many other utilities, Ameren is also “investing in strengthening and modernizing the grid,” the spokesperson said. Increasingly, the costs of meeting those goals are showing up on utility bills around the country.
Customers often think of their utility bill as a measure of the energy they use to keep the lights on, and heat and cool their homes. But it’s also a reflection of what their utility is building or upgrading. Across the country, the rising costs of updating aging energy infrastructure are inflating bills.
The nation’s electricity infrastructure is old, and utilities across the country have recently been pouring money into upgrading it; in just five years, US utilities increased their spending by $5 billion on transmission (the massive high-voltage towers carrying electricity from one region to another) and another $16 billion on distribution (the smaller substations, poles and wires).
Electric utilities are making “essential investments” to strengthen the grid, said Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, an electric utility trade group.
“Our electric grid is America’s most important machine — and we have to make sure it works reliably every day for families, businesses, and local communities,” Maloney said in a statement to CNN.
Part of that investment is driven by new demand growth. Electricity demand in the US used to be pretty flat. Now, demand is exploding primarily from data centers, along with new manufacturing and home and vehicle electrification. Power demand from data centers alone is projected to reach 106 gigawatts in the next decade,according to a reportfrom research firm BloombergNEF.
“Over the last decade or two, we’ve been able to get by with the grid that we have,” said Ryan Hledik, a principal at the research and consulting firm Brattle Group and author of a recent study on electricity prices. “The unfortunate thing is, we’ve been needing to make those investments to basically tread water and keep the grid as reliable as it has been in the past, at a time when the cost of that equipment has been getting more expensive.”
New demand is coming at a pricey time for upgrades. The Covid-19 pandemic thrust global supply chains into chaos and made everything more expensive. As a result, the cost of some electrical equipment like transformers has risen faster than the rate of inflation, Hledik said.
Electrical systems have also taken beatings from flooding, high winds and wildfires, and companies often need to invest more to try to make systems more resilient to future storms.
“The grid is being updated, but it’s definitely still old,” Hledik said. “We’re continuing to confront the reality of more volatile weather conditions. So, it’s not my expectation that the need for this investment is going to be finished” anytime soon.
In some cities around the country, the same is true for the network of gas pipelines that deliver winter heating fuel to millions of homes. There was a customer outcry in Baltimore earlier this year as winter heating costs shot monthly bills above $1,000 for some residents.
Those spikes related to seasonal heating needs were also driven by the cost of replacing (extremely) old equipment. Baltimore Gas and Electric operates the oldest gas system in the country and is replacing hundreds of miles of the most ancient, leakiest iron and steel pipes in the ground,CNN recently reported. One pipe scheduled for replacement this year was first installed during Ulysses S. Grant’s presidency in the 1800s, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos told CNN.
“Our hundreds of miles of century-old gas main is far past the end of its useful life,” Alexopulos said. “We’ve got to upgrade this system.”
BGE crews have already replaced around 600 miles of elderly metal pipes with new, plastic ones and have around 800 miles left to complete, Alexopulos said.
In Illinois, Stephanie Tate got so fed up with her electricity bills that she decided this year to take the plunge and outfit her house with solar panels and a battery storage system, which she expects to be producing power soon.
Tate said she was “stunned” at how expensive her home solar and battery system was, but she expects state and federal tax credits and rebates will cover half of the cost. She plans to pay off the remaining balance in a year and expects the new system will save her thousands of dollars per year on her utility bills.
“I’m extraordinarily excited,” she told CNN. “Every day it’s sunny outside, I’m like, ‘oh gosh, I missed this day with solar. I wish it was up now so that I could reap the benefits.’”
She’s looking forward to having a cooler temperature in her house this summer and also anticipating a more reliable home system that will keep her power on during severe spring storms that can knock electricity out for days.
“Those batteries will run even when Ameren is offline,” Tate said.
She’s hopeful she’ll see her monthly bill reduced to a shell of its former self. However, Tate won’t be completely off the grid; she’ll still have to pay delivery fees to Ameren to remain connected to their system, even as she’s generating and storing her own power. Nevertheless, she remains optimistic.
“I’m just incredibly frustrated with the high bills,” she said. “It doesn’t seem logical that they should be this high, this quick.”
Switching to solar and batteries is “a leap of faith,” she said.

Trump’s gas price discount has disappeared,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/business/gas-prices-oil-trump-biden,"Nov 25, 2025, 5:01 AM ET","President Donald Trump and his economic team often respond to concerns about the affordability crisis by touting how much cheaper gasoline is than under his predecessor.
For the vast majority of 2025, this was alegitimate bragging pointfor the White House.
Until now.
For the first time since the start of Trump’s second term, the discount between this year’s prices and last year’s has effectively disappeared.
The national average for regular gas stood at $3.055 on Tuesday, almost exactly the same as $3.056 a year ago under former President Joe Biden, according to AAA.
In fact, Tuesday breaks an eight-day streak where the national average was up on a year-over-year basis, according toAAA datashared with CNN.
It’s a big shift from earlier this year, when gas was 30, 40 and even 50 cents cheaper than the same point in 2024.
Although prices at the pump are still relatively low and far from theirhistoric peak in 2022, this trend contradicts a key Trump talking point and undermines one of his strongest arguments on affordability.
During a major economic policy speech in Miami on November 6, Trump claimed, “Gasoline prices have plummeted to the lowest in two decades.”
In reality, gas prices were averaging $3.08 a gallon — nowhere near a multi-decade low and just a few pennies cheaper than under Biden the year before.
During an interview on Fox News that aired last Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued, “Oil and gasoline prices are down substantially under President Trump — and that is really the key to affordability.”
Yet gas prices were three cents higher on a year-over-year basis that day.
Americans say there is a disconnect between Trump’s rhetoric on prices and the reality they are experiencing.
According to aCBS News poll, 60% of Americans say Trump makes things sound better than they really are when it comes to prices and inflation.
Just 27% say Trump makes thing sound about as they really are, while 13% say he makes them sound worse.
It’s one thing to embellish unclear or hard-to-quantify numbers like how many trillions of dollars of foreign investment US officials have secured. It’s another matter altogether to tell people groceries are getting cheaper, or prices are plunging at the gas pump, when neither is true.
Gas prices are a highly visible way that many Americans view the cost of living. The spike to $5 per gallon after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 caused an uproar and a political nightmare for the Biden administration.
Thankfully, drivers in some states are saving a bit on gas prices relative to last year going into the driving-heavy Thanksgiving weekend..
Gas prices are significantly cheaper year-over-year in Colorado (24 cents), Wyoming (19 cents), Hawaii (12 cents), Wisconsin (12 cents), Maryland (9 cents) and North Dakota (9 cents),according to AAA.
However, average gas prices are also up significantly in some states, including Oregon (27 cents), Alaska (26 cents), Washington (20 cents), California (16 cents), Idaho (16 cents), Arizona (14 cents), Michigan (9 cents) and Nevada (9 cents).
None of this is to say gas is expensive under Trump. It’s not.
In fact, GasBuddy projects the average national price for gas on Thanksgiving will be is $3.02 — tied for the lowest Thanksgiving price since the pandemic sent prices crashing in 2020. But the year it’s tied with is 2024, so it’s not exactly something for the Trump administration to boast about.
“We’re basically in the same neighborhood as last year. It’s virtually the same price,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “Policy hasn’t really done anything.”
But when adjusted for inflation, gas prices haven’t been this cheap on Thanksgiving Day since 2016, excluding Covid, according to GasBuddy.
“People don’t feel as bad about filling up their tank because they are making more money,” said De Haan.
Some on Wall Street are betting that even cheaper prices are on the way in 2026.
Oil supply is projected to increase faster than demand next year.
Unless OPEC steps in to intervene, Brent crude oil will likely drop into the low $50s per barrel by the fourth quarter of next year and close 2026 in the $40s, commodity strategists at JPMorgan Chase wrote in a research report published Monday.
JPMorgan said the “outlook worsens” in 2027, with a mounting surplus driving Brent to an average of just $42 a barrel and sinking into the $30s by the end of that year.
The projected supply glut is so severe that JPMorgan said producers will “almost certainly” need to make major adjustments by cutting output.
Tom Kloza, a veteran oil market analyst now at Gulf Oil, agrees that the outlook is favorable for gas prices next year.
“It’s an easy road in 2026. Everything points to a surplus of crude,” Kloza said. “There are a lot of things Trump faces challenges on. This is not one of them. It may not be a lay-up, but it’s probably a free throw.”"
Candidate Trump vowed to make America affordable again. President Trump says it’s a ‘scam’,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/business/prices-trump-affordable-jobs,"Dec 5, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump has repeatedly argued the affordability issue is anepic “scam”conjured up by Democrats.
“It’s a con job. I think affordability is the greatest con job,” Trumpsaidfrom the Oval Office on Tuesday.
It’s a bizarre argument on many levels, especially since Trump is about to travel to Pennsylvania on Tuesday to promote his economic agenda and his continued focus on “ending Joe Biden’s inflation crisis,” a White House official told CNN.
And for Trump, calling affordability a scam is doubly strange because it’sthe very issuethat helpedpropel him back to the White House.
Trump successfully tapped into anger over the cost of living in the 2024 election and promised voters he would swiftly bring down prices – even if that wasnever realistic in the first place.
Candidate Trump used remarkably similar language to what President Trump now dismisses as a hoax.
“Inflation is destroying our country,” Trump said during anAugust rally in North Carolinaafterholding up Tic-Tacsto highlight shrinkflation, when companies charge the same for a smaller amount of product. “We will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues.”
Trump said at that rally he would instruct his Cabinet to deliver results “within the first 100 days,” if not earlier.
Weeks later during a rally inMontana, Trump promised to bring down “prices of all goods.”
“Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,” Trump said in a line that herepeated in late Septemberin Pennsylvania.
The No. 3 promise in the 2024 Republican Party platformreads: “END INFLATION, AND MAKE AMERICA AFFORDABLE AGAIN.”
Last month, Trump returned to the matter, briefly, in the hours after Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey won key racesin part by focusing on affordability.
“Affordability is our goal,” Trumppostedon Truth Social on November 5.
Dismissing affordability as a scam is impossible to square with official economic statistics, independent research, alternative measures and pubic polling.
Just 21% of US adults in November described current economic conditions as excellent or good, down from 24% in October and the lowest percentage since March, according to aGallup pollreleased Thursday. Far more, 40%, now say conditions are poor, up from 37% in October.
Relatedly, Gallup’s Economic Confidence Index dropped in November to its weakest reading since July 2024.
Although Trump has dismissed polls as “fake,” Wall Street research backs up these feelings.
Consider that roughly 24% of US households areliving paycheck to paycheck, according to Bank of America estimates.
And Fitch Ratings has found that the percentage of subprime borrowers who arelate on car loanshas doubled to all-time highs, surpassing even levels during Covid or the Great Recession.
Of course, affordability didn’t suddenly become a problem as soon as Trump took office. It’s a years-long issue, one that intensified in historic fashion during former President Joe Biden’s term when a variety of factors conspired to drive inflation to a 40-year high of 9.1% in 2022
Those years of inflation have now snowballed into a higher overall level of prices, frustrating Americans whose paychecks don’t go as far as they used to. Consumers must spend more to get the same, orsometimes less.
Each month the typical US household must now spend $208 more than they did in September 2024 to buy the same goods and services, according to Moody’s Analytics data based on the September inflation report.
That’s almost $2,500 in increased costs per year – for the same amount of groceries, electricity, childcare and other items.
And it’s even worse compared to pre-Biden-era inflation: Each month, the typical household is spending $1,043 more than they did in January 2021 for the same goods and services, according to Moody’s Analytics.
Wages are up – but for many people, not by enough to cover higher prices and save.
That’s what Americans are experiencing, not the fact inflation is at 3% instead of 9%.
But the cost-of-living news isn’t all bad: Gas pricesdropped below $3 a gallonthis week for the first time in four and a half years, according to AAA. It’s a major improvement from the spike to $5 a gallon in 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices skyrocketing.
Part of Trump’s bind is that his favorite economic tool – massive tariffs – are unpopular and viewed as part of the affordability problem.
Economists say they have contributed to price hikes on everything fromcoffee and bananasto car repair andclothing, albeit less than expected.
As of November 1, prices were nearly 6% higher than the pre-tariff trend, according to theHarvard Business School Pricing Lab. Some prices were up even more: furnishings/household equipment and household maintenance (9%), clothing and footwear (15.9%) and coffee/tea/cocoa (9.2%).
And the more the public sees of tariffs, the less they like them. A clear majority, 62%, opposed new tariffs on imports in aCBS News pollin late October. That’s up from 48% who opposed tariffs in aCBS polllast fall.
None of those numbers are helpful for a president who loves import taxes so much that hedubbed himself the Tariff Man.
And Trump’s campaign promises were unrealistic even before he took office. Consumer prices rarely come down en masse – unless there are larger economic issues at play, like a recession.
The best case all along has been that prices would increase so gradually that they’re barely noticed and dwarfed by pay hikes.
The bottom line is Trump faces an almost impossible task in trying to convince Americans the affordability crisis they experience each day doesn’t exist. After all, Candidate Trump told them it does."
Stocks and bitcoin slide as nerves fray ahead of Nvidia earnings,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/investing/us-stock-market,"Nov 17, 2025, 2:50 PM ET","Wall Street kicked off the week on a sour note, with stocks and bitcoin tumbling as a risk-off attitude spread through markets.
The Dow closed lower by 557 points, or 1.18%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.92%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.84%.
Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 13%.CNN’s Fear and Greed indextraded in “extreme fear” and hit its lowest level since early April.
Stocks fell on Monday as investors’ nerves intensified ahead of two key events this week: Nvidia (NVDA), the star of the artificial intelligence boom, is set to report earnings on Wednesday. And on Thursday, the September jobs report — long delayed because of the government shutdown — is set to be released.
These two events will provide more insight about the issues that are “top of mind” for Wall Street, according to José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.
Tech stocks havecome under pressurethis month as concerns linger about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 5.5% since hitting a record high in late October.
Investors are trying to discern whether the AI trade is on stable foundations, and whether the Federal Reserve will pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting in December.
Meanwhile, bitcoin plunged on Monday to below $90,000 for the first time in seven mon﻿ths, erasing its gains for this year. The cryptocurrency has tanked more than 28% in just six weeks after it hit a record high above $126,000 in early October.
Tech and crypto-related stocks led the S&P 500 lower on Monday. Coinbase (COIN), a crypto exchange, fell 7%.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Monday dipped below their 50-day moving averages, according to FactSet. The 50-day moving average is a key threshold of support.
“While the long-term uptrend is intact, we believe a corrective pullback/consolidation phase is already underway after the market’s six-month winning streak,” Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said in a note.
Why markets are suddenly on edge
Stocks are coming off avolatile week. Tech stocks took a bruising last week before investors swooped in on Friday to buy the dip.
Investors this week are gearing up for a potential market-moving event with Nvidia’s earnings. The chipmaker accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500’s market value. Nvidia shares fell 1.83% on Monday, weighing on the broader market.
“The monthly jobs report would normally dominate this week’s economic calendar, but with the AI trade struggling the past couple of weeks, Nvidia’s earnings are once again looking like a key piece of the market’s momentum puzzle,” Chris Larkin, managing director at Morgan Stanley’s E-Trade, said in an email.
The recent stock market rally is also being tested as investors adjust to the prospect that the Fed might pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting next month. Traders are pricing in a 45% chance that the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 94% chance one month ago.
Stocks have rallied on optimism about Fed rate cuts. Nerves are mounting that the central bank may prioritize concerns about stubborn inflation.
“Data releases starting this week should provide a clearer picture for one of the key risks over the coming weeks — the December Fed meeting,” Mohit Kumar, chief strategist and economist for Europe at Jefferies, said in a note.
Investors this month have also rotated out of high-flying tech stocks and moved into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.
“This rotation is both expected and welcome, as it should unwind some of the frothiness … and allow this bull market the opportunity to catch its breath before resuming its advance,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said in a note.

Trump is trying to will lower prices into existence. It won’t work,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/business/lower-prices-inflation-trump,"Nov 10, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump keeps trying to convince Americans that gas costs $2 a gallon. That’s a tall task when it costs $3.
“We’re a little bit above $2 right now for gasoline,” Trump said Friday. “We’re going to be approximately $2 very soon.”
Trump and his administration have made that false claim repeatedly over the course of the year.
The vast majority of Americans aren’t paying anything close to what Trump has been claiming.AAAsays the national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $3.08. Gas is currently cheapest in Mississippi, where the average fill-up will cost $2.60 a gallon.
Making false claims about gas prices and trying to convince Americans that he has made fill-ups dramatically more affordable is a particularlybold choice for Trump: The price of gas is prominently advertised and plastered all over towns and cities across the United States. A gallon of gasoline may be the best-known price – for anything – among American consumers.
Trump is asking Americans to ignore what they see – and pay for. It’s a “Don’t Look Up” strategy that’s proven ineffective: Most Americans remain fed up with the economy and blame Trump for the lack of affordability, according to a newCNN poll conducted by SSRS.
The poll found that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies have worsened US economic conditions.
Democratic party victories in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia elections last week showed that affordability has become an American crisis that could ultimately threaten Republicans and Trump along with them.
So Trump, post-election, has tried to take ownership of the affordability issue.
“The affordability is much better with the Republicans,” Trump said Thursday. “The problem is the Republicans don’t talk about it.”
Focusing on policies thatpromote affordabilitymay move the needle in Republicans’ direction. But, at least so far, making false claims about falling prices has not proven a winning strategy.
If you really want to split hairs, therearea small handful of gas stations across America where you can get fuel at a price that approaches Trump-was-right territory.
The cheapest gas station in the country is the Murphy Express in Ardmore, Oklahoma, which sells regular gas for $2.14 a gallon, according to GasBuddy, which crowdsources gas prices across the country. Early last week, a Costco in Austin, Texas, was selling gas at $1.98 a gallon, but that station has since hiked prices back up to $2.18.
“Generally, we have seen about three to four stations below $2 in recent weeks, but none have held that level for more than a few days,” Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CNN.
That’s three or four stations in theentire United States. GasBuddy tracks 150,000 stations across the country. Those outliers are far from the prices that the vast majority of Americans are paying.
Gas prices have fallen a bit over the past year, and grocery prices are rising more slowly than overall inflation and are a far cry from the 11.4% price hikes they faced when inflation peaked under former President Joe Biden.
But Trump is not even in the ballpark on some his false statements about prices.
“Our energy costs are way down, our groceries are way down, everything is way down,” Trump said Thursday.
“Inflation is at a perfect number,” he added on Friday.
Energy prices arehigher under Trump– up 2.8% in September over the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Residential electricity prices have surgedmore than 6% over the past year– twice the overall pace of inflation. according to theUS Energy Information Administration.
Grocery priceshave risen 1.4% during Trump’s second term. Trump has correctly noted that beef prices are surging because of unique challenges in the market, but grocery bills are up across the board – all six categories tracked by the US government are more expensive now than they were at the end of 2024.
Inflation has been on the rise again, and prices rose 3% in September over the past 12 months – the fastest pace since January. Although that’s far from the crisis-level 9% inflation rate during the summer of 2022, it’s well above the 2% inflation rate that the Federal Reserve targets over the long term.
The reality-denial of millions of Americans’ lived experiences is whatplagued Bidenand helped cost the Democrats the White House in the 2024 election. Trump seemed to understand that during his campaign, making a constant issue of rising prices. But now that he’s in charge of the economy, he’s trying to persuade Americans that the problem has been solved.
The issue is that Americans can’t be convinced that gas costs $2, food prices are falling or inflation doesn’t exist when they can’t make ends meet."
"Nvidia beats earnings expectations, even as bubble concerns mount",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/nvidia-earnings-ai-bubble-fears,"Nov 19, 2025, 4:25 PM ET","Nvidia posted strong revenue and profits that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations Wednesday. The closely watched result could prompt a sigh of relief across the stock market following growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble.
Nvidia’s sales grew 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the October quarter, ahead of the $54.9 billion Wall Street had projected, signaling that demand for AI chips remains strong even as more questions emerge about whether returns from the technology will keep up with the pace of infrastructure investments. It posted profits of $31.9 billion, up 65% from the year-ago quarter and also slightly above expectations.
“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, a message that echoes his earlier arguments that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.
The company also posted stronger-than-expected sales guidance of around $65 billion for the fourth quarter, another indicator that the AI spending spree isn’t slowing anytime soon.
Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) jumped 3.4% in after-hours trading immediately following the report.
Nvidia has become both the backbone and an emblem of the AI boom, with much of the industry’s technology running on its chips. Theworld’s most valuable public companyhas also been central to this year’s stock market rally — it accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500 and its deals with other tech firms have helped fuel their stocks, too — meaning that nearly all investors and 401k holdersstand to be impactedby Wednesday’s results.
Fears of an AI bubble ahead of Nvidia’s report had caused volatility across the stock market as investors adopted a risk-off attitude and dumped assets like bitcoin and AI stocks.
Shares of other tech stocks — including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google — were in the green in after-hours trading following the Nvidia report, underscoring the chipmaker’s impact on the wider market.
“This answers a lot of questions about the state of the AI revolution, and the verdict is simple: it is nowhere near its peak, neither from the market-demand nor the production–supply-chain sides for the foreseeable future,” Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in emailed commentary following the report.
At the heart of the bubble concerns are the circular funding deals that Nvidia and other chipmakers have formed with AI companies, such as a$100 billion investmentin OpenAI in exchange for chip purchases that was announced in September. OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar further raised eyebrows earlier this month whenshe suggestedthat the government should backstop the debt tech companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure — a statement the company later tried to walk back.
But the fears haven’t stopped Nvidia from making more such deals. Anthropic on Mondaycommittedto buying $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft Azure, running on Nvidia chips, in exchange for an investment in the AI lab from both tech giants.
Huang has repeatedly batted down bubble concerns. At the company’s GTC AI conference last month, he told CNN that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure.
The fact that Nvidia’s business continues to hum isn’t surprising given that tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Googleall indicatedin their most recent earnings reports that they plan to continue hiking their AI infrastructure spending. Huang alsolaid outat GTC the company’s plans to get its technology into even more areas of life — from cell phone towers to self- driving cars.
Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress sought to reinforce that AI is generating returns in the company’s earnings call by taking the unusual tack of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads;” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year; and Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off."

"With Trump’s focus abroad, Republicans push for midterms pivot to economy",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/politics/republicans-midterm-message-economy-trump,"Dec 3, 2025, 3:45 PM ET","Some of PresidentDonald Trump’s closest allies in Congress are warning that the party needs to sharpen its affordability message to voters heading into the 2026 elections — or risk big losses that would shackle him for the rest of his second term.
“I would love him to get back to driving around in the garbage truck, going to McDonald’s. Go to a supermarket, go to a farm. That’s when he’s at his best,” Rep. Jeff Van Drew told CNN, recalling a message he conveyed to the president in a lengthy phone call earlier this week. “Next year, we got to concentrate — the American people first.”
Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican in a purple seat, said he’s not worried about his own reelection but is concerned for the political survival of “many of my friends, some people who won by one or two or three points.” And he’s worried about the HouseGOP’s fragile majoritynext November.
Many Republicans in Washington were already privately anxious that their party lacked a clear domestic agenda in Congress, as Trump himself devoted much of the fall to overseas crises. Those fears escalated this week, after their GOP candidate in a special election for a ruby-red Tennessee congressional districtwon on Tuesdayby just nine points, after Trump himself won the seat by 22 points a year earlier.
Inside the party, GOP lawmakers and top strategists acknowledge that the Republican Party – including Trump – need to remind voters they are focused on making life more affordable for everyday Americans, with less emphasis on conflicts likeRussia’s invasion of Ukraineorstrikes on alleged drug boatsin the Caribbean. In the House, that means an ​economy-focused policy agenda in 2026, rather than party infighting on issues like therelease of the Jeffrey Epstein case filesorlawmaker censure votesdominating floor time.
It’s not clear yet exactly how or when party leaders will make the pivot, with Trump himself calling the affordability issue a “scam” anda “con job”by Democrats at aTuesday Cabinet meeting.
The day after the Tennessee special election, Trump again said that affordability is a “Democrat hoax” while unveiling plans to rescind fuel-economy standards for vehicles put in place under the Biden administration — a move he said would save Americans money.
“They use the word ‘affordability’ — it’s a Democrat hoax. They’re the ones that drove the prices up,” Trump said. “They never talk about, like, the specifics.”
“I think affordability is the greatest con job. They look at you and say ‘affordability,’ they don’t say anything else,” he said.
But the pressure to do more on the economy is mounting, and it’s not just battleground Republicans who are sounding the alarm. Ultraconservative GOP Rep. Tim Burchett called Tuesday’s special election in his home state a “wake up” call, warning that “complacency within our party is a problem.”
“The best friend the Democrats have right now is the Republicans messaging, because we do a terrible job of messaging,” Burchett said, lamenting the lack of enthusiasm within the party’s own base, particularly with economic concerns creeping up. “We got a real problem, and we better wake up.”
Across the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he, too, was eying the results in Tennessee as a sign that the party needed to better focus its message, even as he downplayed the results from an off-year race that comes with its own unique circumstances.
“I think, obviously, we need to take to heart the fact that we have to sharpen our message, make sure that we’re giving people a reason to vote for us in the midterms next year,” Thune said.
He added that Republicans needed strong candidates, good messaging, and healthy financial resources next year: “Those are the ingredients to a successful election, and we got some work and some challenges ahead of us this next year.”
(His counterpart, Speaker Mike Johnson, brushed off any signals from the race, telling reporters: “I’m not concerned at all.”)
Some of Trump’s GOP critics in Congress have gone after him directly for his recent focus on military campaigns abroad. That includes Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has attacked him nearly every day on social media for ignoring issues at home.
Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was also blunt in his criticism: “I think that people voted for Donald Trump because they wanted less foreign war.”
“Venezuela is still foreign war. Just because it’s in our hemisphere doesn’t make it a lot different. and so I think there’s a large portion of his supporters that will be very upset with a war in Venezuela,” Paul said on the escalating conflict against alleged drug trafficking in South America.
For many Republicans, the most immediate concern is health care. The party is facing a glaring affordability crisis on December 31, when enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire, threatening to spike health care premiums for tens of millions of people.
No one in GOP leadership or in the White House has yet indicated how they plan to address the expiring subsidies that help lower the cost of Obamacare, even as dozens of their own members push the party to strike a deal with Democrats to avert the cliff.
One of those Republicans is Sen. Josh Hawley, a close Trump ally who has repeatedly urged his party to embrace the growing number of working class voters in their base — and to put affordability at the center of their agenda.
Hawley has pushed hard for GOP leaders to strike a deal to avert steep price hikes for those Obamacare plans, in addition to pushing his own bill to allow individual taxpayers to deduct up to $25,000 in medical expenses.
“We have got to help people be able to afford the necessities of life and just get by day to day. And there’s no better place to start than health care. Nothing costs more than health care,” the Missouri Republican told CNN.
Asked if the party gets the message, Hawley said: “Well, we’ll find out. The president gets it. … He realizes Congress needs to act, and we do. We need to act.”
GOP Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents a battleground seat, said he expects party leaders to make a “conscious effort” to focus on affordability in 2026, adding: “And I hope it’s done in a way that’s actually going to help, as opposed to just trying.”
Kiley has been publicly and privately critical of his party leadership for failing to do more on the issue, frustrated that the House stayed out of session for nearly two months during the fall government shutdown.
“We could have been working on these issues every single day for the last several months. Bringing bills that would move the needle. Working on bipartisan deals. To address the cost of housing, the cost of energy, the cost of health care and everything else. Unfortunately the House wasted a lot of time,” Kiley said.
But he believes it’s not too late. “I think everyone agrees that affordability needs to be at the center of any agenda. Americans are really frustrated right now,” he said.

"Amid tensions with US, high inflation is back on Venezuela’s streets",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/11/americas/venezuela-inflation-us-tension-intl-latam,"Nov 11, 2025, 12:01 AM ET","As Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro faces growing USmilitary pressureand calls for his resignation, an old foe is returning to haunt him in his own backyard: Inflation, one of Venezuela’s chronic economic maladies, is on the rise again.
“Prices are growing every day,” said Yon Michael Hernandez, 25, a motorcycle taxi driver in the slum of Petare, east of Caracas.
“Corn flour is 220 bolivars today, it may be 240 tomorrow and 260 the day after, and the same package that might have cost you one dollar 15 days ago is worth three now,” Hernandez told CNN. He referred to the Venezuelan currency and to the pre-cooked flour used to makearepas,the ubiquitous corn pancakes that are a daily staple.
In the three months since the Pentagon deployed warships and aircraft in a campaign that the White House said was aimed at drug traffickers from Venezuela, the bolivar has depreciated around 70% against the US dollar, according to data from the central bank, hemorrhaging one point every day.
In the illegal but widely used currency black market, the drop has been just as steep. At the official rate, the US dollar is pegged at about 231 Venezuelan bolivars. On the black market, a dollar is worth roughly a third more. The Venezuelan government prohibits publishing black market exchange rates.
The surge in inflation is linked – although only partially – with the growing tensions between the Trump administration and the Maduro government, which has been under US Treasury Department sanctions for almost a decade.
Venezuela urges residents to report neighbors with app
Maduro has accused the United States of seeking to oust him after more than 12 years in power and one year after he controversially claimed to win a presidential election that many international observers accused him of stealing.
While a military attack on Venezuelan soil may not materialize, the economic outlook is firmly in the red once again, after a change of policies gave the country a much-needed boost in the years immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic.
Only last year, Maduro boasted about the results of those reforms, claiming his country’s GDP was growing at 8% and that inflation was at the lowest rate in four decades. The autocratic leader no longer makes such claims.
According to the United Nations, Venezuela historically does not produce enough food to meet its needs, and many products must be imported from abroad and paid for in foreign currencies.
This also means the market is particularly exposed when the bolivar loses value.
For many Venezuelans, still reeling from years of hyper-inflation before the pandemic lockdowns, the new price hikes revive a familiar nightmare.
“Not many people are purchasing these days. Those who can try to buy as little as possible,” said Marjorie Yanez, 40, a street-food seller in Caracas. “Dollars get more expensive every day, and that is bad for retailers like us because we also must raise our prices every day.”
A typical breakfast of croissant andcafé con lechenow can easily cost the equivalent of $8 to $10 at a bakery in Caracas, while the country’s official minimum wage is less than a dollar a month.
The stream of remittances from relatives abroad, a consequence of more than 7 million Venezuelans fleeing the country under Maduro to look for better opportunities elsewhere, is also falling short.
“I had to increase how much I send back to my parents every month, but even with that, it’s not enough. They can barely make ends meet,” said Diego Mejias, 35, an architect in neighboring Colombia who provides for his parents in Caracas.
The central bank stopped publishing inflation reports in October last year, when the country had managed to keep the rate at single digits for 20 straight months.
Shortly afterward, things began to unravel.
In July, Venezuelan security forces briefly detained several economists, including former finance minister Rodrigo Cabezas, for sharing pessimistic views. The interior minister called their comments destabilizing. Critics denounced the arrests as baseless.
The economists were later released, but publishing economic figures remains taboo.
For many Venezuelans, economic fears trump concerns of US military action
For this report, CNN spoke with two private consultants who have access to reliable economic data. Both spoke anonymously for fear of government retaliation.
CNN has also contacted Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who is in charge of Venezuela’s finances, and is waiting for a response.
Both consultants estimated that inflation in Caracas is currently running between 20% and 30% a month and is destined to keep rising as long as the bolivar depreciation continues.
Prices are slightly cheaper outside the capital in regions such as Tachira or Zulia, closer to the Colombian border, where many imported products cross into Venezuela.
Faced with the economic malaise, the government has cracked down on the black market for US dollars. In June, Attorney General Tarek William Saab announced the detention of 58 people on charges of “manipulating exchange rates.” Authorities also seized a dozen web pages advertising the sale of dollars and euros at rates different from the official one by the central bank.
The moves have done little to stop the bolivar’s fall.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s annual inflation at about 270%, the highest in the world and a sharp increase from the 180% rate it estimated in April.
For 2026, the outlook is even bleaker. The IMF forecasts Venezuela’s inflation to top 600% by next October.
The bolivar’s plunge can be partially explained by the US military’s show of force, as nervous Venezuelans seek to purchase hard currency as a hedge against an uncertain future. But that is only one of the causes, the consultants told CNN.
US sanctions against the Venezuelan oil sector, which is the nation’s largest source of foreign exchange by far, are also partially to blame.
In July, the Trump administration renegotiated a license authorizing Chevron, a major US oil company, to export Venezuelan crude. Under the new terms of the license, Chevron was authorized to pay fees and royalties to Venezuela in oil but not in cash, effectively reducing Chevron’s crude exports from the country by half, according to Reuters.
A spokesperson for Chevron said the company “operates globally in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to its business, as well as the sanctions frameworks provided for by the US government, including in Venezuela.”
The change has proved costly because Venezuela lost one of its few remaining sources of legitimate income. As a result, the government is now forced to sell even more oil on the black market at a discount to evade US government sanctions, one of the economists in Caracas told CNN.
To make up for the missing income, the government recently allowed private companies to sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for the depreciated bolivar, with exchange houses openly supported by a new crypto-managing regulator, the National Superintendence of Crypto Assets, known as Sunacrip.
Last year, Reuters reported that the government was preparing to increase usage of crypto assets in its oil exports to overcome the US sanctions. According to the specialized data collector Chainanalysis, Venezuela is second only to Brazil for crypto adoption rates in Latin America.
Today, thousands of Venezuelans – from corporate bankers to retirees – regularly purchase US dollars on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. It is even common to see shoppers at grocery stores trading currencies in the checkout lines.
Not everyone has embraced the new normal. “Sending money to Venezuela has always been a mess,” said Mejias, the architect in Colombia. “Now it’s even more confusing to understand what rate is good and what is not, and for old people like my parents, even more.”"
UK’s unpopular government delivers tax-raising budget after leak that outlined its main plans,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/26/economy/uk-budget-leak-intl,"Nov 26, 2025, 11:10 AM ET","Britain’s unpopular center-left Labour government sought to seize the political narrative Wednesday with a tax-raising budget that it hopes will boost economic growth, reduce child poverty and ease cost-of-living pressures.
But the chaos that has engulfed the government during weeks of mixed messaging and political infighting continued up to the final moment. The entire contents of the budget were leaked half an hour before Treasury chief Rachel Reeves delivered the budget statement in the House of Commons.
The government was elected in a landslide victory in July 2024 on a promise not to raise taxes on income for working people, and Reeves acknowledged that some of the budget’s £26 billion ($34 billion) in tax hikes broke the spirit of that pledge and would face criticism.
But, she said, “I have yet to see a credible or a fairer alternative plan for working people.
“These are my choices – the right choices for a fairer, a stronger, and a more secure Britain,” she said.
The biggest change in terms of money raised is freezing the thresholds at which earners pay Britain’s different tax levels for a further three years from 2028, meaning as wages rise, more people fall into higher tax brackets.
Other measures included a mansion tax, changes to the capital gains tax regime, higher gambling taxes, a new levy on electric car use and a cut to tax-free provisions for private pensions.
Reeves also abolished a much-hated cap on benefits paid out to families with more than two children. She also announced measures to ease the financial pressure on households, by freezing rail fares and cutting levies on household energy bills.
Britain is one of the world’s richest countries. So why do a third of its children live in poverty?
Overall, the budget was strikingly similar to Reeves’ first budget a little more than a year ago, even though she insisted at the time that it would be the one and only big tax-raising budget in this parliamentary term, due to run to 2029.
Unfortunately for Reeves, the UK economy, the world’s sixth-largest, isn’t doing as well as she hoped, with many critics blaming her decision last year to slap taxes on business. Though there were signs the economy was improving in the first half of the year, when it was the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, it has faltered again.
Britain’s public finances, like those of other nations, have been squeezed in recent years by the costs of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The United Kingdom bears the extra burden of Brexit, which has knocked billions off the economy since the country left the European Union in 2020.
Meanwhile, Reeves has a bunch of spending commitments aimed at easing the cost of living as inflation remains stubbornly high, including making up for a series of about-faces on planned welfare cuts.
The budget followed weeks of messy mixed messaging and political acrimony that continued into the minutes before Reeves stood in the House of Commons.
On November 4, Reeves made a speech to prepare the public and markets for a hike in income tax rates, which would break a key election promise. After an outcry among Labour lawmakers, and a better-than-expected update on public finances, she reversed course, opting for a smorgasbord of smaller revenue-raising measures.
Then, the entire fiscal forecast from the independent watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), including details of the budget’s main measures, was published online half an hour before Reeves’ statement.
Reeves said the early release was “deeply disappointing and a serious error” by the budget watchdog.
The OBR blamed a “technical error” for the leak, saying it went “live on our website too early this morning.” It said it will report to all relevant authorities, including the Treasury, as to what happened.
The budget is a high-stakes moment for Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is facing mounting concern from Labour lawmakers over his dire poll ratings. Opinion polls consistently put Labour well behind the hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.
The next election doesn’t have to be held until 2029, and the government continues to hope that its economic measures will spur higher growth and ease financial pressures.
But speculation is swirling about a potential challenge to Starmer’s leadership from within his party, and analysts say a misfiring budget could add to the sense of crisis within the government."
Trump’s latest tariff TACO probably won’t make your life more affordable,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/15/business/tariffs-trump-taco-affordability,"Nov 15, 2025, 3:00 AM ET","Americans could soon see some goods get cheaper after President Donald Trump exempted certain agricultural imports from a set of tariffs on Friday. But any price drops likely won’t be enough to make life feel more affordable any time soon.
The executive orderexempted products like coffee, beef and some fruitfrom Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, which began rolling out in April.
The new exemptions are part of what traders have dubbed TACO, or Trump Always Chickens Out, to describe times when the president backs off a policy after unintended consequences pop up. In the case of tariffs, Trump has already reversed a number of his measures, a sign that the administrationis reshaping his signature economic tool.
The latest TACO comes after voters, worried about affordability,gave Republicans a drubbingin recent off-year elections.
Nevertheless, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the new exemptions generally won’t help improve affordability.
“It depends on what the importers do with the tariff,” he said in a CNBC interview on Friday. “So when you look at the overall price trend, it hasn’t been because of tariffs. It’s been because of these other events going on and just supply and demand.”
But in cases where tariffs have been passed along to consumers, prices could drop, Greer said.
One potential example: bananas. American consumers are paying about 8% more for bananas than before Trump’s second term began.
The US largely imports bananas from South American countries. With bananas exempt from “reciprocal” tariffs that started at 10%, prices could go back to where they were earlier this year, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. But it’s unlikely to be something most consumers notice unless they’re buying bananas often, she added.
But not everyone is convinced it will even do that much.
“It is not clear that lowering tariffs will lower prices — it depends on what retailers think they can get away with. The import price of bananas has fallen since tariffs were imposed, but the US consumer price has risen,” Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS global wealth management, said in a note last week. (The United States tracks import prices before accounting for tariffs. In some cases, import prices have fallen as exporters lower what they charge as a way to share in the tariff expense importers pay.)
The White House has ramped up its efforts to convince voters that affordability issues are just a hangover from former President Joe Biden.
“Putting Joe Biden’s inflation crisis firmly behind us has been a priority for President Trump since Day One, when he signed an array of executive orders to slash costly regulations and unleash American energy,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNN in a statement.
But economists generally agree that Trump’s tariffs aren’t making matters better.
And while prices normally fluctuate, especially for food, they generally get more expensive over time, House said. “That’s why this isn’t going to, I think, cure consumers’ angst about elevated prices,” she said."
Planet Earth has never had so many billionaires,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/business/billionaires-worldwide-record-ubs-intl,"Dec 4, 2025, 11:48 AM ET","The number of billionaires worldwide – and their combined wealth – reached record highs this year, buoyed in particular by gains in tech stocks, Swiss bank UBS has found.
The world had 2,919 billionaires on April 4, when UBS completed that part of its research, the largest number since the bank started collecting the data in 1995.
“With tech shares and financial asset prices generally rising, despite volatility, billionaires’ total wealth reached a new high,” UBS wrote in its annualreporton billionaires published Thursday.
The MSCI World Index– which tracks more than 1,300 large and mid-sized public companies in developed markets – rose around 7% in the year to early April.
Billionaires’ combined wealth reached $15.8 trillion, an increase of 13% over 12 months, lifted by existing tech billionaires’ appreciating assets and by new billionaires across a range of sectors, the bank said. The number of billionaires jumped by 237 in the 12 months to April 4.
Tech billionaires’ assets grew by almost a quarter to $3 trillion, bolstered by the increasing value of their shares in artificial intelligence-linked companies such as Meta (META), Oracle (ORCL) and Nvidia (NVDA).
The six US tech billionaires whose wealth increased the most became $171 billion richer between them, UBS said, meaning that each became $28.5 billion richer on average.
“This surge is closely tied to their companies’ AI capabilities, from foundational chipmaking to AI-powered cloud infrastructure,” the bank wrote.
The total number of US billionaires rose to 924, accounting for almost a third of the global billionaire population. China now has 470 billionaires, second only to the United States.
UBS surveyed its billionaire clients between July and September 2025 and they identified tariffs, geopolitics and policy uncertainty as the top risks of 2026.
“What billionaires worry about most depends on where they live,” the bank wrote. For instance, 75% of billionaires in Asia-Pacific were concerned about tariffs, while 70% of American billionaires worried about higher inflation or a major geopolitical conflict."
Uncle Sam is outperforming the S&P 500,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/investing/equity-stakes-government-stock-market,"Nov 17, 2025, 4:00 AM ET","The Trump administration is investing in publicly traded companies — and it’s sending stocks soaring higher.
Under President Donald Trump, the US government has taken equity stakes in companies including Intel (INTC), MP Materials (MP), Lithium Americas (LAC) and Trilogy Metals (TMQ). Investing in public companies is an unusual move that has sparked debate on Wall Street and Capitol Hill about whether the government should be interfering in markets.
Proponents say the equity stakes are a strategic move to support companies in industries that are critical to national security, such as rare earths mining and the production of semiconductor chips. Critics, meanwhile, say it’s a heavy-handed use of government influence that is un-American and exposes taxpayers to unnecessary risk.
So far, the government’s portfolio is outperforming the S&P 500. Intel shares are up 77% this year. MP Materials shares have soared 276%. Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals shares are up 50% and 204%, respectively. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 14.5% this year.
“Markets seem to be understanding these deals as the federal government signaling it will continue to support these companies,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.
MP Materials is a rare-earths mining company. The company on July 10 announced the Department of Defense (now the Department of War) would purchase $400 million of the company’s stock, giving it a 15% equity stake and making it the company’s largest shareholder.
This company is America’s best chance to loosen China’s grip on rare earths
Intel, thebeleaguered chipmaker, announced on August 22 that the US government would invest $8.9 billion in the company, resulting in a 9.9% equity stake. On October 1, the Energy Department announced it would take a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas, a lithium production company.
Trilogy Metals, a mining company that is developing anenormous mining project in Alaska, announced on October 6 that the US government would invest in the company. The Department of War took a10% equity stakein Trilogy Metals.
The Commerce Department announced on November 3 that it would take a $50 million stake in Vulcan Elements, a private rare earths start-up. The government also has a“golden share”in US Steel as part of a national security agreement with Nippon Steel, which acquired the company in June.
The Trump administration’s actions are meant to address trade tensions with China, including bolstering supply chains of critical materials like chips and rare-earth minerals.
Rare earths in particular have become a sticking point in the US-China trade war. The minerals are used in everyday items like mobile phones as well as highly sensitive industries like defense, aerospace and the military.
What are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump’s trade deal with China?
China accounts for roughly 70% of global rare-earth elements mining output, 90% of rare earths refining output and over 90% of rare-earth magnet production, according to ING, a Dutch bank.
‘Self-sufficiency, allied resilience and national industrial champions are no longer optional,” James Litinsky, chief executive at MP Materials, said on the company’s earnings call on November 6. “They are the front lines of security.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that “the Trump administration is committed to using every tool at our disposal to safeguard America’s national and economic security.”
There is precedent for the government to take stakes in companies to bail them out during a crisis. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the government took stakes in companies including General Motors, Chrysler and AIG, then turned a small total profit when it exited those stakes by 2015.
But the government taking stock in companies outside of emergency situations is rare. Experts say it falls within a legal gray area.
“It is a real break from past attitudes toward government ownership, particularly for Republicans,” Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, said in an email.
Skeptics say this kind of government intervention goes against free market values — and raises the risks of big losses for taxpayers. It’s also uncertain that an equity stake can produce stronger supply chains.
Trump is trying to break China’s monopoly on rare earths, but can’t cut deals fast enough to catch up
“There is the risk of failure. Not all investments work out,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “You’re going to find people who are questioning, ‘Why are we doing this? We don’t need to risk our tax dollars.’”
Scott Ladner, CIO at Horizon Investments, said he was skeptical about the decision to take stakes in companies. The government historically has been poor at picking winners, he said, and it could divert money away from other, more compelling companies that are not in the government’s purview.
“I just don’t like the precedent that it sets going forward,” Ladner said. “These individual ones might end up working fine, but the precedent and the power that it gives to the government 10, 15, 20 years from now — I don’t love that precedent.”"
The world’s biggest company just told everyone to chill out,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/22/tech/ai-bubble-fears-nvidia-earnings,"Nov 22, 2025, 3:00 AM ET","Concerns about an AI bubble have been simmering forat least a year and a half.Nvidia’s incredibly strong earnings this past week tried to put those fears to bed. It may not have been enough.
Nvidia on Wednesdayposted sales and profitsup more than 60% year-on-year, stronger than Wall Street had projected. CEO Jensen Huang said “sales are off the charts.” And the company expects fourth quarter revenue of around $65 billion, once again ahead of Wall Street’s projections.
Nvidia executives said these results, along with growth from other major AI players and thebillions being poured into AI infrastructure, indicate that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.
“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” Huang said on a call with analysts Wednesday. “From our vantage point, we see something very different.”
Nvidia beats earnings expectations, even as bubble concerns mount
Some Wall Street analysts agree.But the wider market is not yet convinced: After briefly ticking up on Thursday morning following Nvidia’s report, the chipmaker’s shares (NVDA) dipped back into the red. They closed Friday down 1%, although the stock remains up 29% from the start of this year.
In other words, Nvidia answered a lot of questions about where the industry stands right now, but it may take more to shift the overall AI narrative.
Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company anticipates $3 trillion to $4 trillion in annual AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade, adding that demand “continues to exceed our expectations.” Already, tech giants are expected to pour $400 billion into AI-related capital expenditures this year, to meet what they say is growing demand for AI and cloud services but also to avoid falling behind industry rivals.
Nvidia has every reason to try to reassure investors — expectations for the company are sky-high after nearly two years of astronomical growth. And many look to the chipmaker as a bellwether for the overall tech industry.
Even as Silicon Valley tries to figure out the business model for generative AI, Nvidia has a big role to fill in the existing tech services people use every day, Huang said. That could help insulate Nvidia even if returns from new AI applications are smaller than expected or take longer to arrive than planned.
“The world has a massive investment in non-AI software, from data processing to science and engineering simulations, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in cloud computing spend each year.” Much of the infrastructure powering that software has transitioned from running on older CPU chips to Nvidia’s GPUs, the chips known for running AI tools, Huang said.
Kress also took the unusual step of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads.” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year. And Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.
Nvidia isn’t the only one arguing that AI bubble concerns may be exaggerated.
“The pure Nvidia numbers/guidance and strategic vision shows the AI Revolution is NOT a Bubble…instead its Year 3 of a 10-year build out of this 4th Industrial Revolution in our view,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in emailed commentary.
Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at investment research company Morningstar, said he doesn’t “see many signs to suggest that 2026 will be a weak year for Nvidia in any way” and sees the bubble fears weighing on the company’s stock as a “buying opportunity.”
But despite those strong results, it appears the stock market may not be ready to relax just yet.
Questions remain about whether tech firms will maintain their massive spending on AI infrastructure, especially asNvidia has invested inkey, unprofitable customers such as OpenAI and Anthropic. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar alsoraised alarmsearlier this month when she suggested that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are incurring to build AI infrastructure. Some took her comments as a sign OpenAI may struggle to afford its commitments, although the company later tried to walk back the statement.
And while Nvidia likely has enough customers even if a bubble burst causes some casualties among AI firms, investors may still be worried about what a downturn or even a slowdown could mean for the larger market.
Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, said questions about the sustainability of Big Tech’s infrastructure spending spree and Nvidia’s circular funding deals were not “put to rest” with its latest report. Instead, they may just be “punted” to the next quarter.
That means Nvidia almost certainly has more work ahead to convince the world that we’re in for an AI boom and not bust."
"Berkshire profit rises, cash soars to record",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/berkshire-hathaway-profits-buffett,"Nov 1, 2025, 9:08 AM ET","Berkshire Hathaway signaled on Saturday that it remained cautious about markets, letting cash swell to a record $381.7 billion even as profit rose, in its last financial report before Warren Buffett bows out as chief executive.
Between July and September, Buffett’s conglomerate also sold more stocks than it bought for its $283.2 billion equity portfolio, whose holdings, including Apple and American Express, the 12th straight quarter it was a net seller.
Berkshire also repurchased none of its own stock, the fifth straight quarter without buybacks, though its stock price has significantly lagged the broader market.
Buffett, 95, is letting cash build up as he prepares to end his six-decade tenure as chief executive at the end of the year.
Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 63, will succeed the legendary investor, though Buffett will remain chairman.
Abel is known as a more hands-on manager than Buffett. It remains unclear how he might spend Berkshire’s cash, which could include paying the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s first dividend since 1967.
Berkshire is planning to use $9.7 billion ofcash to buyOccidental Petroleum’s OxyChem chemicals business, a transaction announced in early October.
Third-quarter operating profit rose 34% to $13.49 billion, or about $9,376 per Class A share, from $10.09 billion a year earlier.
Operating results benefited from lower loss projections in some of Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance businesses, though the Geico car insurer reported lower underwriting gains as it spent more to acquire new policies.
Quarterly net income, including gains and losses on stock investments, rose 17% to $30.8 billion, or $21,413 per Class A share, from $26.25 billion a year earlier.
Buffett downplays net results because they include gains and losses on stocks Berkshire is not selling. This adds volatility, and Buffett believes net results are useless in understanding his company.
Investors have voted their apprehension about Berkshire’s outlook and pending management change by selling its stock.
Since Buffett announced on May 3 he wouldstep down, Berkshire’s stock price has fallen 12%, and trailed the Standard & Poor’s 500 by 32 percentage points.
For all of 2025, Berkshire is 11 percentage points behind the index.
Berkshire owns close to 200 businesses that also include utility and renewable operations, chemical and industrial companies, and familiar consumer brands such as Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See’s Candies.
It has not made a huge acquisition since paying $32.1 billion for Precision Castparts in 2016, though it later bought Pilot Travel Centers for $13.6 billion and the Alleghany insurance holding company for $11.5 billion.

Trump is trying to make ‘affordability’ his issue. Good luck with that.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/affordability-trump-gop-analysis,"Nov 7, 2025, 11:56 AM ET","President Donald Trumpis nothing if not gifted at crafting politically advantageous alternate realities. Throughrepetition, force of will and shamelessness, he’s convinced tens of millions of Americans ofa host of dubious or outright-false claims– most notably that the 2020 election he lost was somehow “stolen.”
But Trump’s latest effort to rewrite reality is brazen and puzzling even by his standards.
As inflation has proven stubborn, and even ticked up, and as energy andgrocery prices have continued to rise, Trump has set about trying to convince people that this isn’t the case at all.
“I will say this: If you look at affordability, which they campaigned on, they lied,” Trump told reporters on Friday, referring to Democrats’ success in Tuesday’s election.
“Because they talked about, ‘Oh, prices are up.’ No, no. Prices are down under the Trump administration. And they’re down substantially.”
He’s arguing that the rising costs people can see and feel are actually down. And now he’s trying to make “affordability” his calling card.
Good luck with that.
Polls have made clear Americans not only overwhelmingly understand prices are rising, but they strongly link this to Trump’s policies.
What’s more, the president has allowed a particularly troublesome perception to fester: that he’s been asleep at the wheel.
It’s difficult to see how pretending that inflation doesn’t exist and that his administration has done a great job on this issue is going to change that. If anything, it could exacerbate a perception that the administration is divorced from reality.
Trump has responded to Republicans’ poor 2025 election results by suddenly keying like a laser on “affordability.” He might not have much regard for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s democratic socialist policies, but he seems happy to rip a page out of Mamdani’s political playbook.
“Why did Zohran Mamdani do so well last night? He relentlessly focused on affordability,” top White House political adviser James Blairtold Politicoon Wednesday.
Trump’s MAGA ally Vivek Ramaswamy, who is running for Ohio governor, cut a video on election night urging Republicans to set aside their focus on culture warsin favor of an affordability focus.
Fact check: Trump falsely claims it’s only beef, but dozens of groceries have gotten more expensive this year
Trump has posted on social media and spoken repeatedly about affordability in the last few days, claiming on Friday that Democrats’ message on the topic was a “con job” and that Republicans need to do a better job talking about his economic successes.
“The only problem is the Republicans don’t talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads, because we have great numbers,” he said Thursday, claiming there’s “virtually no inflation.”
Trump has also repeatedly pointed to Walmart’s annual Thanksgiving grocery list costing under $40 this year compared to about $55 last year.
The talking point isa complete non sequitur, as CNN’s Daniel Dale writes. It’s not apples-to-apples because this year’s list has fewer items. And it’s clear that grocery prices writ large are up. In fact, average prices in Septemberwere up 1.4% compared to Januaryand up about 3% since last year, according to a recent Consumer Price Index study. They also just saw theirlargest one-month year-over-year increase (0.6%) in three yearsthis summer.
When pressed on the apples-to-oranges comparison of the Walmart Thanksgiving list on Friday, he dismissed the question as “fake news.”
But it’s not just that prices are up; it’s also that people recognize that, despite Trump’s claims.
A CBS News-YouGov poll last week showed just7% of Americans said prices have been going downrecently. Another 62% said they’re going up.
A Washington Post-ABC News poll, meanwhile, showsfewer than 10% of Americans say they’re paying less for groceries and utilitiescompared to a year ago. Conversely, 71% said they’re paying more for groceries, and 59% said they’re paying more for utilities.
And more than that, people draw a direct line from these price increases and economic pains to Trump.
All of which brings us to perhaps the one economic number that I keep coming back to on this topic.
CBS has asked repeatedly during Trump’s second term whether he was focused enough on lowering prices.
The percentage who said he’s focused “not enough” on this has risen from 64% in March to 70% in July to 75% in October.
That’s three-quarters of Americans who haven’t seen Trump doing enough on this topic. Even a clear majority of Republicans – 57% – say Trump has neglected the issue.
These perceptions are baked-in now, in large part because Trumphasneglected the issue, at least until he decided to start saying “affordability” a lot in recent days.
If anything, he’s given people a shorthand to tie him to this persistent inflation. That’s in part because he decided to make tariffs, which are often inflationary, his signature economic policy. And he decided to implement them unilaterally, making it clear exactly who is responsible for them. He voluntarily took near-complete ownership of the economy, and now he’s trying to pretend things have gone better than they have.
Trump might be able to convince some people that what they see with their own eyes at the grocery stores or on their electric bills isn’t real. Maybe he’ll get some MAGA Republicans to misremember prices being higher a year ago.
But when it comes to convincing the rest of the population they’re better off now, it’s really hard to see that working.
Trump’s alternate realities often resonate because Americans live in information silos where his claims aren’t fact-checked. That can work well when it comes to complex subjects like voter fraud.
But prices are things people can fact-check with their own eyes. They’re facts that are quite literally in people’s faces on a daily basis.
And ultimately, what Trump risks is instead convincing people that he’s out of touch with their economic realities.

US economy – and seaweed – slow tourist flow to Mexico’s Caribbean resort town,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/23/americas/tulum-mexico-tourism-slump-latam-intl,"Nov 23, 2025, 9:00 AM ET","Armed with shovels and wheelbarrows, municipal workers fromTulum, Mexico, were deployed to the resort town’s famed beaches in June, tasked with removing large quantities of sargassum that had piled up to cover the crystal-clear waters.
By that point in the year, authorities said they had collected 1,900 tons of thepesky seaweed, more than the 1,300 tons collected in all of 2024.
Local officials and hotel owners have told CNN that the amount of sargassum this year is the largest they’ve seen since 2018 – an issue that has contributed to a lower flow of visitors this year.
But the seaweed isn’t the only problem facing Tulum, a town in Yucatán Peninsula renowned for its idyllic coastlines and archaeological wonders. Other factors, such as the shaky US economy, local insecurity and the management of beaches, are also impacting tourism at this Caribbean destination, a favorite among Americans.
Tulum had fewer tourists this summer than in 2024, according to official figures and industry leaders.
During the week of August 16-22 this year, hotel occupancy was 53.3%, and the week of September 6-12 was even lower, dropping to 48.1%, according to the tourism secretariat of Quintana Roo state.
David Ortiz Mena, president of the Tulum Hotel Association, told CNN that the figures for this period are about four percentage points lower than those of 2024. He, however, rejected the notion that the situation is critical, arguing that summer is not the area’s peak season and that tourism begins to increase as the year comes to an end.
Ortiz Mena said he believes the main reason behind the summer slump was the economic uncertainty in the United States, which accounts for approximately 60% of Tulum’s tourists.
According to the businessman, inflation in the US, changes in interest rates and even the recent 43-day government shutdown – which paused payments to many federal workers – forced Americans to limit their vacations.
But there are already signs of “a clear recovery,” he said.
Hotel occupancy was 59.8% in the week of October 18-24 and reached 69.1% in the week of November 1-7, according to the most recent data from the state tourism secretariat.
“Tulum remains a great destination. It has a wide range of tourist attractions. Unfortunately, the negative aspects are emphasized, making it difficult to convey the positive,” said Ortiz Mena.
His views were shared by Eliazar Mas Kinil, Tulum City Council member with a focus on tourism, industry, commerce and agricultural affairs.
“The United States is our neighbor. So, everything that happens in the United States impacts us,” Mas Kinil told CNN. “In the end, I think American citizens are careful with their resources.” Tulum will have “a much higher season” in December and January, he predicted.
To attract more American tourists, officials are also working to improve public safety, an issue that reached a boiling point in March when local Secretary of Security José Roberto Rodríguez Bautista was killed in an armed attack.
The US State Department still maintains a Level 2 travel advisory – out of possible 4 – for all of Quintana Roo. This means that Americans are urged to exercise increased caution when visiting the state.
Hazael Cerón, coordinator of the Center for Tourism Research and Competitiveness at Anáhuac University, said he believes the main challenge is to strategically plan Tulum’s development. He said the town experienced “a boom” after the Covid-19 pandemic and was boosted by recent public works projects such a new international airport and theTren Maya, a large rail system connecting five states in the Yucatán Peninsula.
According to Cerón, Tulum’s authorities and business owners must work with academics to analyze travel trends, invest in both hotel and urban infrastructure, monitor the quality of services and prevent excessive charges for tourists.
“Tulum is an example we must protect. In fact, I think it will be an experiment for other traditional destinations that are also falling behind, like Acapulco or Mazatlán,” he said.
Councilman Mas Kinil acknowledged that strategic planning, establishing clear rules on issues such as beach access, and improving tourist services are key aspects for Tulum’s future.
“We, the public servants in tourism, the operators, the guides, the taxi drivers, the people, we also need to reflect on the fact that we have to provide better service to our tourists … so that they return to Tulum,” he said.
Mas Kinil recalled that the recent establishment of a natural reserve resulted in new restrictions that now prevent tourists from entering some beaches with disposable objects like plastic bottles and straws.
He said access to the beaches is still free for Mexicans and foreigners, and that authorities are working to better explain the rules that aim to protect the environment.
Officials and business leaders expect hotel occupancy to grow toward the end of the year and the beginning of the next one. They also see the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which Mexico will co-host with the US and Canada, as an opportunity for Tulum to receive more visitors.
Although Tulum will not be one of the tournament’s host cities, the tourism sector is confident that the resort town, or others in the Mexican Caribbean, can attract foreigners traveling to the country for the games.

Ortiz Mena noted that Tulum has 10,800 hotel rooms, ranging from luxury suites to hostels priced between $20 and $22 a night.
“It is very likely that this will contribute to the Mexican Caribbean, that people will take advantage of the extensive hotel infrastructure and the excellent connectivity, and this is estimated to mean 1 million more travelers for the Mexican Caribbean in 2026,” he said.
Cerón, the researcher, said that while room prices have remained stable, taxi fares and other costs tend to be high, including the price of coconut, which some businesses sell for up to 200 pesos, about $10.50.
“Suddenly we see the basket of golden eggs and want to milk it dry, and that’s what happened,” he said.

Phones might get pricier next year. Thank the AI boom,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/tech/memory-shortage-phone-computer-prices,"Dec 5, 2025, 5:01 AM ET","Fancy cameras, giant screens andmassive storageusually make smartphones more expensive. But next year, it’s a routine component that might be boosting prices: memory.
And it’s not just phones. Any device that uses memory, from phones to tablets and smartwatches, could get pricier.
Memory prices are rising for consumer products because major manufacturers are instead ramping up production for AI data centers as artificial intelligence companies boom.
“It’s pretty much brutal and crunched across the board,” said Yang Wang, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.
TheInternational Data Corporation, a global market research firm, reported earlier this week that the smartphone market is expected to decline by 0.9% in 2026 in part because of memory shortages. Memory prices are expected to surge by 30% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and may climb an additional 20% early next year,Counterpoint Researchsaid last month.
Tech companies like Meta, Microsoft and Google have aggressively expanded theirdata centers and infrastructurethis year to keep up with AI demand. And that growth is expected to continue: A report fromMcKinsey & Companyindicates companies will invest nearly $7 trillion in data center infrastructure-related costs globally by 2030.
That’s prompted memory manufacturers like Micron and Samsung to shift their focus to data centers, which usea different type of memorythan computers and smartphones. As a result, there are fewer resources for consumer products, said Wang.
Memory and storage companyMicron announced on Wednesdaythat it’s exiting the consumer memory business, citing a “surge in demand” coming from “AI-driven growth” in data centers.
Jaejune Kim, executive vice president for memory at Samsung, said in October that the companysaw strong demand for memory for AI and data centers in the third quarter. He also said the supply shortage for mobile and PC memory is expected to “intensify further.”
Gadget makers may have to face tough decisions about when to launch and how to price their products, analysts say.TrendForce, a research firm that follows the semiconductor industry, estimates memory price hikes have made smartphones 8% to 10% more expensive to produce in 2025 (higher production costs don’t always translate into higher consumer prices for a variety of reasons).
Some smartphones could cost moreas soon as early next year, said Nabila Popal, a senior research director for the International Data Corporation. Cheap Android phones may see the biggest impact, since less expensive products usually have thinner margins.
“It’s going to be almost impossible for them to not raise prices” of cheaper Android phones,said Popal.
Companies may also postpone phone launches to focus on expensive models that may be more profitable. The average selling price for smartphones is expected to climb to $465 in 2026, compared to $457 in 2025, according to Popal, putting the smartphone market at a record high value of $578.9 billion.
But the pendulum is expected to swing back in the other direction late next year as the supply chain adjusts, according to Popal and Wang, potentially bringing prices back down or at least capping increases.
The semiconductor industry is used to grappling with change as new technologies emerge, says Wang. But it may have not been prepared for how quickly AI demand would grow.
“In the semiconductor space, there’s always going to be a mismatch (in supply and demand),” he said. “This was kind of unexpected.”"
Dow stumbles and tech stocks slide as volatility picks up on Wall Street,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/investing/us-stock-market,"Nov 6, 2025, 12:07 PM ET","US stocks closed lower Thursday as concerns mounted about expensive tech stocks, and a risk-off sentiment spread through markets after new data showed a bleak outlook for the job market.
The Dow closed lower by 399 points, or 0.84%, after briefly falling as much 524 points earlier. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.12%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.9%.

“Large cap tech stocks have been on an unstoppable run over the past six months, with particular strength over the past two months, and a pullback has been long overdue,” Robert Edwards, chief investment officer at Edwards Asset Management, said in an email.
“Big tech stocks have their hands on their knees, dripping with a bit of sweat and gulping for air — that’s a natural response after a monster run over the past few months,” Edwards said.
Meanwhile, investors rushed in to government bonds, pushing yields lower, after data showed an acceleration in layoff announcements last month. The number of announced jobs cuts in October wasthe highest increasefor that month since 2003, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
US Treasury bonds are considered safe bets when there are signs of a slowdown in the economy. A weakening labor market can also bolster arguments for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Investors tend to buy Treasuries when the Fed is expected to cut rates in order to lock in current yields.

“With yields still attractive and likely to fall, we continue to believe that quality fixed income offers an appealing combination of income and the potential to perform well in the event of slowing economic activity and further rate cuts,” Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note.
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Thursday that there are “a lot of things taking place today, and there’s a lot of turbulence out there.”
“That creates a little more uncertainty that you should be prepared for,” Dimon said at the America Business Forum in Miami. “And, hopefully, you know, we’ll continue to have the soft landing [taming inflation while avoiding high unemployment], but it may not happen. We just don’t know.”
Wall Street this week was also attuned to theSupreme Court’s deliberationsand oral arguments about the legality of President Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariff regime that relies on an emergency powers law.
Investors in recent months have looked past concerns about tariffs, while the revenue collected has helped assuage bond investors’ nerves about enormous US deficits. While a decision on the tariffs is not immediately expected, it could prove to be a thorny issue for investors if the tariffs are struck down — despite the headache they caused earlier this year.

The Buffett Indicator is at a record high above 217%, signaling the stock market might be strongly overvalued.
“The S&P 500 today is at historically extreme valuations,” Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said in a note.
Stocks have climbed higher this year on strong corporate earnings and enthusiasm about AI. Yet concerns also linger that the market’s gains are increasingly reliant on tech companies.
Wall Street’s bar for positive surprises is also rising, analysts say. Some companies that have reported third quarter earnings have beaten analysts’ estimates but are still seeing their shares slide. Shares in Duolingo (DUOL), the language learning company, plunged 25.49% on Thursday and had their worst day on record after the company’s outlook and guidance underwhelmed investors.

Jassy explained that as Amazon added headcount, locations and lines of business in recent years, “you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers … sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work.”
Amazon’s headcount peaked at more than 1.6 million in 2021; it ended last year with around 1.5 million employees, according to SEC filings.
“It can lead to slowing you down as a leadership team,” he said. “We are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup, and … that means removing layers.”
Although Amazon said this week that the layoffs were more about staying “nimble” in anticipation of future AI efficiencies, the layoffs have nonetheless spurred fears about technology replacing human workers. Amazon (AMZN) shares climbed 13% after-hours following the earnings report."
Major milestone: US gas prices drop below $3 a gallon for first time since May 2021,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/business/gas-prices-three-dollars,"Dec 2, 2025, 5:47 AM ET","The last time gasoline was this cheap,4% inflationseemed alarming, JD Vance wasstill a private citizenand the United States had only just begun its messywithdrawal from Afghanistan.
Gas prices dropped below an average of $3 a gallon in the United States on Tuesday for the first time in four-and-a-half years, according to AAA.
The milestone represents a rare feel-good story in a years-long affordability crisis marked by high prices for necessities.
The national average forregular gas dipped to $2.998 a gallon, compared with $3.001 on Monday. Pump prices are down about six cents in just the past week and are below $3 for the first time since May 2021.
Gas is also cheaper than it was last year, albeit modestly. The national average a year ago was $3.05 a gallon. Last month, gas prices werebriefly more expensiveon a year-over-year basis.
Prices are even lower in many parts of the country.
According to AAA, the average price for gas is below $2.75 a gallon in 18 states, including New Mexico, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Iowa and Colorado.
It’s a far cry from 2022 when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices skyrocketing. At one point, gas prices surged beyond $5 a gallon for the first time ever, prompting the Biden administration to release emergency oil stockpiles.
President Donald Trump has made lower energy prices a central focus of his second term, vowing to keep a lid on prices at the pump by embracing a “drill, baby, drill” agenda of deregulation and support for fossil fuels.
Days into his second term, Trump also used a high-profile speech at Davos to call for Saudi Arabia-led OPEC to ramp up production.
Although Trump’s promises to slash grocery prices have not borne out and electric bills have increased sharply, gas is a bit cheaper than it was at this point last year. The biggest reason: Oil is much cheaper than it was at this point in prior years.
In early December 2022, months after Russia invaded Ukraine, US oil prices were sitting at about $81 a barrel. At this point last year, crude traded at around $70 a barrel. Today a barrel of crude is selling for just $59.
Oil has been driven lower by the fact that supply continues to outpace demand.
US oil production continues to break record highs, although it is only slightly higher than a year ago.
The bigger driver is the fact that OPEC has ramped up production this year, something the producer group refused to do in years past.
As always, oil prices can quickly change course, especially if investors fear a geopolitical conflict will threaten supplies. Trump in recent days has threatened to attack Venezuela, which hasmore oil reservesthan any nation on the planet.
But some on Wall Street are betting oil prices could stay cheap for some time, keeping gas prices low.
If OPEC doesn’t intervene to ease the supply glut, Brent crude oil – the international benchmark – will likely drop into the low $50s per barrel by the fourth quarter of next year and close 2026 in the $40s, JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote in a recent report.
JPMorgan said the “outlook worsens” in 2027, with a mounting surplus driving Brent to an average of just $42 a barrel and sinking into the $30s by the end of that year.

Modelo and Corona are unexpected casualties of Trump’s immigration crackdown,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/business/modelo-corona-economy-immigration,"Dec 3, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","Constellation Brands, the US owner of Modelo Especial and Corona, bet big on Latino customers for growth. But that strategy is unraveling under the Trump administration’s mass deportation push.
Many Latino consumers, both legal and undocumented, are fearful of venturing out in public to stores, restaurants and bars due to theimmigration enforcement blitz, according to customer surveys, companies and market research. Big parties and celebrations where beer often flowed have been scaled back or canceled. Job cuts in industries with large immigrant workforces have squeezed finances, as hasa broader cost-of-living crunch.
Constellation’s sales have plunged, Modelo lost itstop-selling beer spotto Michelob Ultra, and its stock has dropped nearly 40% this year, making it one of the worst-performing companies on the S&P 500.
The company’s struggles illustrate how President Donald Trump’s immigration policies have ricocheted to unexpected corners of the economy and corporate America, upending years of wagers by some of America’s largest companies on the growing purchasing power of Latino consumers.
These pressures have hit Constellation harder than most companies because Latinos make up roughly half of Constellation’s beer customers – by far the largest concentration in the industry. California, home to the largest Latino population in America and a primary target of raids by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is also Constellation’s biggest market.
“Hispanic consumers are the single-most important consumer group for our beer business,” a Constellation executivesaidlast year. They have “been the foundation of how we’ve been able to drive growth.”
Constellation declined to comment for this article. The White House did not respond to request for comment.
In 2013, Constellation acquired the sole US rights to distribute Grupo Modelo, the Mexican beer giant that brews Corona, Modelo, Pacifico, Victoria and other beers.
The deal transformed Constellation from a mid-sized wine seller in upstate New York into one of the largest alcohol companies in the world. It was also a bet on the long-term potential of Latino consumers, whose population in the United States has nearly doubled over the past 25 years to68 million.
“Why we’re so confident about the future is our Hispanic consumers,” Constellation said in 2013 following the purchase.
The company launched new lines of Modelo based on popular drinks in Mexico; advertised in Spanish-language media; and saturated stores in heavily Hispanic markets in California, Texas and Florida. If an ad failed to test well with both Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers, it didn’t run, the companysaidin 2023.
These efforts made Constellation a rare bright spot in a slumping US beer industry as consumers shifted toward non-alcoholic drinks and cannabis. Drinking has declined among White adults, according toGalluppolling, but it has remained fairly steady among people of color.
“Constellation has been on this wonderful ascent because they had such a strong Latino business,” said Martin Stock, who worked on Constellation’s beer brands for six years as CEO of advertising agency Cavalry. “They had brands that had a leg in Latino culture and they then broadened them out.”
Modeloovertook Bud Lightas the top-selling beer in America in 2023, and Corona became the fifth-largest beer by sales.
“The beer business in general is having a brutal time,” Stock said. “Constellation was an exception. They ran counter to the beer trends up until about 10 months ago.”
Bud Light loses its title as America’s top-selling beer
The Trump administration’s sweeping deportation push hasrattledcompanies of all sizes, particularly in immigrant corridors in Los Angeles; Chicago; Charlotte, North Carolina; and other major cities.
Nearly half of US small business owners say that increased immigration enforcement has had a negative impact on their business, according to apollreleased in November by Small Business Majority, an advocacy group. In Texas, for example, restaurant owners say customer traffic has dropped and employees have quit, according to asurveylast month from the Texas Restaurant Association, a trade group.
Other corporate giants are also hurting. Burlington, Wingstop, Colgate-Palmolive, PepsiCo and others have all reported sales declines at stores and restaurants in heavily Latino neighborhoods.
Constellation warned investors in its annual securities filing in April that changes in immigration laws and enforcement “impacting consumers, particularly Hispanic consumers,” are a risk to its business.
Its beer shipments to US retailers plunged 8.7% last quarter and are expected to decline by up to 4% in its 2026 fiscal year.
Latino customers have changed their shopping habits in ways that are “anti-our business,” CEO Bill Newlands said in October.
“The Hispanic consumer is very concerned at the moment,” he said. “The results that (we) are seeing in high Hispanic zip code areas is significantly worse” than in other markets.
Seventy-eight percent of Hispanic adults say economic conditions today are fair or poor, according to a Pewpollreleased in November. Hispanic consumers are more likely than other Americans to rate their current economic situation negatively, Pew found.
The big question for Constellation is if the pullback by Latino customers is fleeting – or if it represents a long-term threat to the company.
Some analysts say Constellation can mitigate the downturn because it has broadened the market for Mexican beers to non-Hispanic consumers. They expect Constellation to both expand distribution and marketing in areas with lower Latino populations and to roll out smaller, cheaper pack sizes to draw economically strapped shoppers.
But Constellation’s recovery hinges in large part on whether the Trump administration ramps up deportations, sending consumers further into hiding and shrinking the market.
The volatility is “unprecedented,” Newlands said. “We’re cautiously – and I would stress that word again – cautiously optimistic that we’ve hit the bottom here.”"
Fact check: Trump’s lying spree about inflation,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/inflation-trump-fact-check,"Nov 10, 2025, 2:45 PM ET","President Donald Trump went on a lying spree about inflation last week.
Grocery prices. Gas prices. Prescription drug prices. Overall prices. Over just three days, Trump made false claims about all of them.
Trump was discussing the issue of “affordability” after Democrats won state and local elections Tuesday in part bycampaigning on the cost of living. Hearguedthat this theme was “a con job by the Democrats” given how successful he said he has been in lowering prices.
But Trump repeatedly used inaccurate statistics and assertions to make his case that Democrats were dishonest. Here is a fact check.
Over and over, Trump claimed overall prices have fallen since he returned to office in late January.
“Every price is down,” hesaidThursday. “Everything is way down,” hesaidat another Thursday event. “Prices are down under the Trump administration, and they’re down substantially,” hesaidFriday, adding, “Everybody knows that it’s far less expensive under Trump than it was under Sleepy Joe Biden. And the prices are way down.”
None of that is true.
Prices are up during this administration. Average prices were 1.7% higher in September than they were in January, according to the most recentfigures from the federal Consumer Price Index, and 3% higher than they were in September 2024. Therehas been inflationevery month of the term, andfar more productshave gotten costlier than cheaper.
TrumpclaimedFriday: “We have almost no inflation. We’re down now to 2%.” He said at the same event: “Inflation is almost nonexistent.”
Those claims are slightly more accurate than Trump’s late-Octoberclaimsthat “we don’t have any inflation” and that “we’re down to 2%, even less than 2%.” But the new claims are still wrong.
Inflation not only very much continues to exist but has been accelerating since the spring. As of September, the year-over-year inflation rate hadincreased for five consecutive months.
The September rate, 3%, was the same as the rate in January, the month Trump returned to the White House. Inflation of 3% is simply not inflation of 2%. (Core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy prices,was also 3% in September.) And this “2%” claim wasn’t a one-time slip by Trump; heclaimedin late October, “We’re down to 2%, even less than 2%.”
Trump claimed on bothWednesdayandThursdaythat “groceries are way down.” Butgrocery prices are actually up. Average grocery prices rose 1.4% between January and September, Consumer Price Indexfigures show, and they rose 2.7% between September 2024 and September 2025. The 0.6% increase in average grocery prices from July 2025 to August 2025, meanwhile, was the biggest month-to-month spike in three years – and it was followed by a 0.3% increase from August to September.
Trump has repeatedly claimed that beef is the only grocery product whose price has increased this term. “Groceries are way down, other than beef,” heclaimedWednesday. “We have much lower prices than (Democrats) do, and we only have one thing, beef,” heclaimedThursday.
This is also false. The prices of dozens of individual grocery products increased from January to September. A smattering of products got less expensive over that period, most notablyeggs, but a far greater number of products got more expensive; you can see a listhere. Prices increased from January to September in five of the six overarching groups of grocery prices tracked by the Consumer Price Index.
Trump continued to usemathematically impossible figureswhen making claims about how much he is supposedly reducing prescription drug prices. “We’re bringing drug prices down to levels nobody ever thought was possible, tremendous cuts, 200%, 300%, 500%, 700%,” heclaimedThursday, adding later, “now we’re cutting it 1,000%, 1,200%.”
Trump has had some success in pushing drug companies to cut the prices of some medications; he made these comments at an event announcingreductionsin the prices of certain blockbuster obesity drugs. But far more medications have not had their prices slashed – and regardless, Trump’s professed reductions in excess of 100% make no sense even if he is talking about a small number of specific drugs. A price reduction of 100% would make a drug cost $0, so a reduction of 200% or more would mean Americans would be getting paid a substantial amount of money to acquire medications. That is not happening.
Trump has been making false claims about gas pricesformonths. HeclaimedWednesday: “Gasoline prices have plummeted to the lowest in two decades.” That wasnot even close to truegiven that the national average on Wednesday was $3.08, according to data provided by AAA – higher than it was on various days under Biden in January of thisyear, as well as during2020andearly 2021(amid the Covid-19 pandemic) and duringmuch of the 2000s and 2010s. “Plummeted” is also a stretch given that the AAA national average was $3.12 per gallon on the day Trump returned to office in January and $3.10 per gallon one year before Wednesday, both just barely higher than Wednesday’s $3.08 per gallon.
It’s possible Trump was attempting to refer to the federal Energy Information Administration’sestimatein September that drivers will this year spend “the smallest share of their disposable income on gasoline since 2005.” But that’s an estimate, not a certainty, and it’s simply not the same thing as Trump said about gas prices alone; “there’s a big difference between ‘lowest gas prices in 20 years’ and ‘least amount of your paycheck going to fill your tank in 20 years,’”Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, noted to CNN. It’s not necessarilyyourpaycheck, either. The federal estimate is based onoveralldisposable income in the economy, so some Americans have less than the estimate while others have more.
Trump also made other false claims about gas prices last week. On Thursday, Trumpclaimed, “We’re at almost $2 for gasoline.” On Friday, heclaimed, “We’re a little bit above $2 right now for gasoline.” Even granting Trump some wiggle room for the words “almost” and “a little bit,” there is no reasonable argument that a national average above $3 per gallon is “almost $2” or “a little bit above $2.” (De Haan said GasBuddy found one gas station, out of the tens of thousands of stations the company tracks, that sold gas for under $2 per gallon last week – and even that station only did so for a single day.)
Trump, echoing a claim he hasmadefor months,saidWednesday that Biden “had the highest inflation rate in the history of our country.” TrumpsaidFriday: “We took over a mess. The highest inflation in recorded history.”
It wasn’t the highest in history, as CNN and others have noted in numerous articles. Trump could have fairly said the inflation ratehit a 40-year high under Biden in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to theall-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920 – and Trump didn’t mention that it had declined to 3% by Biden’s last partial month in office in January, the same as the most recent Trump-era figure for September.
Trump’s claim was also incorrect if he meant the Biden presidency set a record for cumulative inflation over the course of a presidential term; the Biden-era increase was much smaller than the increase during President Jimmy Carter’s term.
TrumpclaimedFriday: “Energy prices are way down from what they were last year.”
But the Consumer Price Index shows thathousehold energy pricesare up substantially over the last year – 6.2% higher in September 2025 than they were in September 2024.
It’s possible Trump was not meaning to refer to household energy. A review of his recent comments suggests he often uses “energy” to describe eithergas prices at the pumps, which have fallen a little over the past year, oroil prices on world markets, which have fallenmore substantially.
So we won’t label this Trump claim false given that he could have been talking about the price of a barrel of oil. But when he doesn’t define the term “energy,” and speaks about it while discussing consumer prices, he leaves his assertion open to a possible misinterpretation."

HP’s teams focused on product development, internal operations and customer support will be impacted by the job cuts, CEO Enrique Lores said during a media briefing call.
“We expect this initiative will create $1 billion in gross run rate savings over three years,” Lores added.
The company laid off an additional 1,000 to 2,000 employees in February, as part of a previously announced restructuring plan.
Demand for AI-enabled PCs has continued to ramp externally, reaching over 30% of HP’s shipments in the fourth quarter ended October 31.
A global memory chip price surge brought on by rising demand from data centers could push up costs and pressure profits at consumer electronics makers such as HP, Dell and Acer, Morgan Stanley analysts have warned.
Why is Nvidia, the world’s leading AI chipmaker, entangled in the US-China trade war?
Big Tech’s pushto build out AI infrastructurehas triggered price increases for dynamic random access memory and NAND — two commonly used types of memory chips — amid high competition in the server market.
Lores said that HP expects to feel the impact in the second half of fiscal 2026, with higher price increases. HP has enough inventory in hand for the first half.
“We are taking a prudent approach to our guide for the second half, while at the same time implementing aggressive actions like qualifying lower cost suppliers, reducing memory configurations and taking price actions,” Lores said.
The company expects fiscal 2026 adjusted profit per share (HPQ) between $2.90 to $3.20, below analysts’ average estimate of $3.33, according to data compiled by LSEG.
HP expects adjusted first-quarter profit per share between 73 cents and 81 cents, with the midpoint coming below estimates of 79 cents apiece.

"China’s military firms struggle as corruption purge bites, report says",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/30/business/china-military-firms-struggle-purge-intl-hnk,"Nov 30, 2025, 9:44 PM ET","Revenues atChina’s giant military firms fell last year as corruption purges slowed arms contracts and procurement, according to a study released on Monday by a leading conflict think tank.
The Chinese declines contrast with strong revenue growth globally for big arms and military-services companies, fueled by wars inUkraineandGaza, and global and regional tensions, the research by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute found.
“A host of corruption allegations in Chinese arms procurement led to major arms contracts being postponed or canceled in 2024,” said Nan Tian, director of SIPRI’s Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme.
“This deepens uncertainty around the status of China’s military modernisation efforts and when new capabilities will materialize.”
The People’s Liberation Army was one of the main targets of a broader corruption crackdown ordered by President Xi Jinping in 2012, reaching the upper levels of the military in 2023 when its Rocket Force was targeted.
Eight top generals were expelled from the ruling Communist Party on graft charges in October, including the country’s number two general,He Weidong. He had served under Xi on the Central Military Commission, China’s supreme military command organization.
Asian and Western diplomats say they are still trying to gauge the impact of the crackdown on China’s ongoing military rise and how far down it reaches through the command chain.
Revenues of China’s top military firms fell 10% last year, while those in Japan surged 40%, Germany 36% and US revenues rose 3.8%, SIPRI data shows.
Revenues of the world’s 100 largest arms firms rose 5.9% to a record $679 billion, the report said, while China’s fall was enough to make Asia-Oceania the only region to post a revenue decline among its top arms firms.
China’s weapons revenue fell despite three decades of rising defense budgets in Beijing’s growing strategic rivalry with the United States, Asia’s traditional military power, and tensions over Taiwan and the hotly disputed South China Sea.
The buildup is bearing fruit as China deploys the world’s largest naval and coast guard fleets – including a potentially advanced new aircraft carrier – a host of new hypersonic missiles, nuclear weapons and air and sea drones.
Revenue fell at AVIC, China’s largest arms maker, land-systems producer Norinco and aerospace and missile manufacturer CASC, all state-owned, according to the SIPRI research. Norinco experienced the steepest revenue decline, falling 31% to $14 billion.
Corruption-related personnel changes at the top of Norinco and CASC sparked government reviews and project delays, while deliveries of AVIC’s military aircraft slowed, the research found.
China’s defense ministry and the three companies did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment from Reuters.

The timeline of advanced systems for the People’s Liberation Army’s Rocket Force, which handles its growing arsenal of ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles, could be exposed, along with aerospace and cyber programs, said SIPRI researcher Xiao Liang.
This adds to uncertainties over the PLA’s target of getting key capabilities and war-fighting readiness in place for its 100th anniversary, Liang said. The PLA’s forerunner, Mao Zedong’s Red Army, was founded in 1927.
“However, in the medium and longer term, sustained investment in defense budgets and political commitment behind modernisation will continue, albeit with some program delays, higher costs and tighter control of procurement,” Liang said."
Trump is threatening to attack a country with more oil than Iraq,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/business/venezuela-oil-trump,"Dec 2, 2025, 4:01 AM ET","The United States appearsready for warwith Venezuela, a prospect that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro this weekend attributed to America’s desire to control the country’s vast oil reserves.
The USState Department has deniedthat oil played a central role in America’s military sending more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops to the region – or that oil is behind President Donald Trump’s warnings that land strikescould be imminentand planes shouldavoid Venezuelan air space. Instead, the Trump administration says its military threats are part of America’s effort to stop flows of undocumented migrants and illegal drugs from Venezuela.
Whatever the rationale behind the rapidly intensifying situation in the Caribbean, if regime change is coming to Venezuela, the largest proven oil reserve on Earth will play a central role in the country’s future.
Most people associate large oil stockpiles with the Middle East or Texas, but Venezuela is sitting on a massive 303 billion barrels worth of crude – about a fifth of the world’s global reserves, according to theUS Energy Information Administration. It’s the planet’s single-largest known mass of crude oil.
Venezuela’s potential far exceeds its actual output.
Venezuela produces about 1 million barrels of oil per day – no slouch, but only about 0.8% of global crude production. That’s less than half of what it produced before Maduro took control of the country in 2013 and less than a third of the 3.5 million barrels it was pumping before the Socialist regime took over in 1999.
International sanctions on the Venezuelan government and a deep economic crisis contributed to the decline of the country’s oil industry – but so did a lack of investment and maintenance, according to the EIA. Venezuela’s energy infrastructure is deteriorating, and its capacity to produce oil has been greatly diminished over the years.
That’s a particular problem, because the kind of oil Venezuela is sitting on – heavy, sour crude – requires special equipment and a high level of technical prowess to produce. International oil companies have the capability to extract and refine it, but they’ve been restricted from doing business in the country.
The US government has imposed sanctions on Venezuela since 2005, and the first Trump administration in 2019 effectively blocked all crude exports to the United States from state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela. Then-President Joe Biden in 2022 granted Chevron a permit to operate in Venezuela as part of an effort to lower gas prices – a license Trump revoked in March but later reissued on condition that no proceeds go to the Maduro government.
The United States produces more oil thanany other country in history. But it still needs to import oil – especially the kind that Venezuela produces.
That’s because the United States produces light, sweet crude, which is good for making gasoline but not much else. Heavy, sour crude like the oil from Venezuela is crucial for certain products made in the refining process, including diesel, asphalt and fuels for factories and other heavy equipment. Diesel is in tight supply around the world – in large part because of sanctions on Venezuelan oil.
The United States imported 102,000 barrels per day from Venezuela as of September, according to theEIA. That’s good for the No. 10source of imported oil to the United States – but it pales in comparison to the 254,000 barrels per day imported from Saudi Arabia and 4.1 million from Canada.
For decades, America was far more dependent on Venezuelan oil than it currently is.
Venezuela is nearby and its oil is relatively cheap – a result of its sticky sludgy texture that requires significant refining. Most US refineries were constructed to process Venezuela’s heavy oil, and they’re significantly more efficient when they’re using Venezuelan oil compared to American oil, according to Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.
Opening up Venezuelan oil to the world could benefit the United States and its allies – and, potentially, the Venezuelan economy.
The restrictions on and decimation of Venezuela’s energy industry suggest it could become a much bigger supplier of oil. That could create opportunities for Western oil companies and could serve as a new source of production. It could also keep broader prices in check, although lower prices might disincentivize some US companies from producing oil.
“If we had a legitimate government in Venezuela to run things, that would open up the world to more supply, reducing the risk of price spikes and shortages,” said Flynn. “It would be a huge thing if we could reinvigorate the Venezuelan oil market.”
Even if international access were fully restored tomorrow, it could take years and incredible expense to bring Venezuelan oil production fully back online: PDVSA says its pipelines haven’t been updated in 50 years, and the cost to update the infrastructure to return to peak production levels wouldcost $58 billion.
If a friendlier government to the West came into power in Venezuela, that enormous cost may be worth paying – not only for oil and refinery companies’ profits, but for geopolitics as well.
For example, Russian oil is similar to Venezuela’s, which is why India and China remain so dependent on it despite international sanctions designed to cripple the country’s ability to fund its war in Ukraine. Adding capacity to Venezuelan production could provide an alternative to Russian oil, weakening Russia’s economy – and its ability to wage war in Ukraine.
The sanctions have also dealt a significant blow to the Venezuelan economy: PDVSA represents the single-largest revenue source for Maduro’s government. Restoring the company to its prior capacity could pay significant dividends to Venezuela.
“It’s really a sad story, and it shows how a regime like that can hurt the Venezuelan people,” Flynn said. “They can make it great again, but they’ve got to get rid of Maduro.”
That’s why some have speculated that oil may be playing a role in the Trump administration’s decision to pressure Maduro. This weekend, Madurosent a letterto OPEC’s secretary general, claiming the Trump administration wants to seize his country’s oil reserves.
“(Oil) is at the heart of the matter,” Colombian PresidentGustavo Petro told CNNin an exclusive interview. “So, that’s a negotiation about oil. I believe that is Trump’s logic.”"
"At some food banks, surging demand means a struggle to feed families",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/27/business/thanksgiving-food-banks-strained,"Nov 27, 2025, 7:01 AM ET","In Polk County, Iowa, the Urbandale Food Pantry started giving out turkeys and Thanksgiving sides weeks ago. Demand was so high, with over 2,000 families visiting so far this month, that the pantry ran through its allotment of Thanksgiving staples.
Fortunately, additional funding, including donations from the community,meant the pantry could continue to supply Thanksgiving items.
But the high demand at Urbandale is emblematic of what many food pantries and organizations are seeing this year: increased need, as high prices squeeze Americans’ wallets and many families are still recovering from the interruption in SNAP benefits because of the government shutdown.
Food banks face a ‘perfect storm’ of surging demand as shutdown drags on
“This month has been unlike anything we’ve seen,” Patty Sneddon-Kisting, the pantry’s CEO and only full-time employee, told CNN.
Food prices have been a source of stress for many Americans this holiday season. Grocery pricesgained 1.4%between January and September, and US consumer prices haverisen 1.7%on average this year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But that relatively low inflation builds on years of much higher rates, includinga multi-decade highof 9.1% annual inflation after the pandemic. The accumulated price increases have left many Americans struggling to keep up.
And when the government shut down for six weeks earlier this year, the pause in full SNAP benefits drove many Americans even closer to the edge. Google searches for “food banks near me” hit a new high over that time.
Meanwhile, wage growth for many workers has fallenbehindincreases for those at the top of the economy. In contrast to stock market gains and surging home prices for wealthier Americans, the number of households receiving SNAP benefits hasgrownsince 2023, according to Pew Research Center.
“When food prices are increasing and their monthly income isn’t really increasing to match it, it puts a lot of pressure on household budgets,” Michael Flood, executive director of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, told CNN.
Flood said his food bank hasn’t been able to keep up with demand this Thanksgiving season. However, support from volunteers has enabled LA Regional Food Bank to expand its distribution sites, with total food distribution up 24% compared to the Thanksgiving period last year, according to Flood.
Over the past month, the group of food pantries that comprise Share Food Program in Philadelphia saw a 12-fold increase in new registrants looking for food support, said George Matysik, the executive director. He added that emergency funding from the state and community donations enabled the program to continue buying food.
“These last few months have been the most challenging in the history of our organization,” he said.
At least one resource, though, is abundant: In a busier-than-usual holiday season, the volunteers who power these food banks are stepping up their efforts to help their friends and neighbors, pantries told CNN.
“We typically seem to have more than enough people out volunteering,” said Mary Connors, a retiree who has volunteered with the LA Regional Food Bank for six years. “Everybody’s excited to give back.”"
Why car prices won’t stop rising,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/business/average-car-prices-fifty-thousand,"Dec 3, 2025, 6:30 AM ET","Prepare for automotive sticker shock next year – again.
Average new car prices brieflytopped $50,000in September for the first time, before slipping back under that level in October.
But now, automotive experts say, car prices are headed back over that level. And this time, they might stay there.
Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, and Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, say cars are nearing that mark.
“It’ll edge up, even as much as the consumer doesn’t want to pay that amount,” said Drury. “It’s just the cost of everything on a car is going up, and $50,000 is just not that far away.”
The higher prices for cars – a necessity in many transit-starved cities and towns – are part of a larger affordability crisis that’s squeezed Americans, leaving many living paycheck to paycheck just to get by.
President Donald Trump, alongside top auto executives, announceda “reset” of federal fuel-economy standards for vehicles during a White House event on Wednesday.
Trump said his action, which rolls back emissions standards set by the Biden administration, will lead to lower car prices by reducing the costs automakersaccrue to meet tougher emission rules.
“Today my administration is taking historic action to lower costs for American consumers, protect American auto jobs and make buying a car much more affordable,” Trump said.﻿ “These policies force automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices.”
Trump also claimed that this move should save consumers $1,000 off the price of a car.
The CEOs of Ford and Stellantis, the European automaker that produces the Jeep, Ram and Dodge brands in the US, issued statements in advance of the event that praised the administration’s actions. Butthe change will do little to lower the cost of building cars.
All automakers plan their models and features years in advance, and many buyers look for improved fuel economy when shopping for cars.
Automakers also have to meet tougher mileage rules in other countries, and even some individual US states. Despite facing legal challenges from the Trump administration, many states follow strict emission rules set California.
Lastly, Wednesday’s action likely will not provide additional savings since mileage rules were essentially gutted earlier this year when legislation ended financial penalties for automakers for exceeding emission standards.
General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was not at the White House event, said earlier Wednesday that GM would continue improving fuel efficiency even if the mileage rules are rolled back. Speaking from the New York Times’ Dealbook conference in New York, Barra added that GMwould also continue to invest in electric vehicles.
No matter what changes are made to fuel-efficient rules, here’s why Americans will likely shell out more for a new car next year.
Car buyers often shop based on their anticipated monthly payment, with 80% of car sales financed, according to Experian.
Nearly a fifth of new cars now have monthly payments of $1,000 or more, Experian said, a result of a 30% increase in car prices and sharply higher interest rates since October 2019.
If the Federal Reserve keeps cutting interest rates, buys could face less in interest costs. But, perversely, that could give dealers room to increase their prices, keeping total monthly payments the same or even higher. (Anyone who’s ever bought a car likely knows the negotiating process at the dealership that ultimately determines how much a car costs.)
“Most consumers do shop by a monthly payment,” said Keating. “So I think that the monthly payment is far more impactful than anyone is giving it credit for. While affordability will still be an issue, they may feel a lot better about that monthly payment as rates go down.”
Wealthier households have also prospered in the K-shaped economy, in which higher- and lower-income households see diverging fortunes.
Stock market gains, fatter paychecks, rising home prices and anticipated tax refunds from Trump’s massive domestic policy bill could all fuel demand from richer buyers, driving sales of costlier models and pushing up average prices overall.
“This is why we believe the spring selling season is likely to be better than it’s been in typical years,” said Keating.
The end of the electric vehicle buyer tax credit in Trump’s tax and spending bill in July got a lot of attention. But the bill also quietly removed financial penalties for automakers that exceed emission regulations.
That means automakers now have greater freedom to concentrate on sales of larger, more profitable pickup trucks and SUVs – which also happen to be more expensive, again lifting average car prices in general.
Automakers have so far been reluctant to raise car prices too much and risk angering Trump, as well as potentially losing buyers to rivals.
But the average sticker price, after rising less than 3% compared to a year earlier in all but one month through August, rose about 4% in September and October, according to Edmunds. That’s because the model-year 2026 vehicles are hitting the lots, typically with higher sticker prices. Those newer models will make up an increasing share of sales going into next year as the remaining 2025 model-year vehicles are cleared out.
But there’s at least one scenario in which prices could fall – although it might be worse than higher price tags.
If the job market softens further and people increasingly lose their jobs, the bottom can fall out of the demand. Sales plunged thanks to the job losses of the Great Recession, with General Motors and Chrysler ending up with bankruptcies and federal bailouts.
No one is predicting anything that catastrophic this time. But job losses and a recession would be one very painful way to keep prices in check.
“I don’t think the headwinds predict that much of a fall,” said Keating. “I don’t think it’s waving warning flags just yet that say, ‘Hey, we’re in for a big dip.’”

What on Earth just happened to the stock market?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/business/stock-market-dow,"Nov 21, 2025, 7:48 AM ET","A day after Thursday’s anxiety-inducing fake out, Friday turned into Redemption Day on Wall Street.
The Dow ended the day 493 points higher, or 1.08%, after gaining as much as 800 points earlier in the day. The broader S&P 500 finished out the day 0.98% higher and the Nasdaq was up by 0.88%.
The earlier bounce back came after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said he supported lowering near-term interest rates, giving traders hope that they could geta December rate cut, after all.
Friday’s gains cap a topsy-turvy and highly confusing week for markets.
Going into Thursday, the sagging stock market had two big questions it wanted answered: Is the artificial intelligence bubble about to burst, and will the Fed cut interest rates in December?
At first, it seemed like traders finally got the clear response they had been eagerly awaiting:
Phew. Right?
Wrong.
Traders at firstcheered Thursday morning, sending all three major stock indexes sharply higher. At one point, the Dow was up more than 700 points. But by late morning, the rally started to wear off, and sentiment – and markets – turned sharply negative by midday.
Traders came to realize that the answers they thought they received actually just raised new, more difficult questions.
“People are trying to figure out A.) What’s better than off the charts in terms of what Nvidia can say from here and realizing that there’s no reward at these levels and B.) how the Fed can cut if jobs numbers are really better,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital.
By the end of the day Thursday, it was like nothing had changed: Markets resumed their slide that has sent the S&P 500 down more than 5% from the all-time high it reached just before Halloween.
Markets rebounded Friday, but Nvidia was essentially flat.Bitcoindropped by around 2% to levels not seen since April and is on pace for its worst month since 2022.
Nvidia’s quarterly earnings were so blow-out that investors began to fear that the world’s most valuable company and maker of the most precious commodity in tech – high-end AI chips – couldn’t possibly keep up this pace of growth for much longer.
Eventually, demand will ebb. And even if it doesn’t anytime soon, the AI market isn’t just Nvidia – other, less powerful companies could still be overinflated. Perhaps, traders feared, Nvidia’s earnings didn’t actually answer any of their questions at all.
Investors also looked more closely at aparticularly confusing jobs reportand realized it might not say exactly what they initially thought: The headline number showed much stronger-than-expected hiring in September, suggesting that the worst of the early-summer hiring slowdown may be behind us. The unemployment rate may have risen because more workers were entering the labor force, resuming their job searches after the summer lull.
Williams’ glass appears to be half empty. But if the Fed takes a glass-half-full approach – particularly after minutes from its last meeting released Wednesday showed significant resistance to another rate cut in December – perhaps that rate cut won’t be coming next month, after all.
So here we are on Friday, right back where we started.CNN’s Fear and Greed Indexis in “extreme fear” mode and at its lowest level since – you guessed it – April. The VIX volatility index briefly spiked to 27, its highest level since… do we even need to say it?
Until investors get satisfactory answers to their questions, expect more market volatility going forward. But with shutdown-delayed government data, an end to earnings season and traders about to go on vacation for the holidays, it’s not clear those answers are coming anytime soon.

Britain is one of the world’s richest countries. So why do a third of its children live in poverty?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/24/uk/britain-child-poverty-intl-scli,"Nov 24, 2025, 12:00 AM ET","Thea Jaffe never expected to use a babybank. In fact, she was responsible for referring other single parents from her local community group to the charityLittle Village, which provides essential supplies for new parents who otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford them – everything from strollers and cots to clothes, diapers, toys and books.
But when Jaffe, who lives inLondon, became pregnant unexpectedly with her second child, she couldn’taffordto buy everything she needed. “It’s so overwhelming having to accommodate a baby with no budget,” she told CNN.
“I was already struggling financially… but I didn’t know how bad things were going to get… Now things are at a point where I’m working full time, and I cannot pay my bills.”
Child poverty has reached a record high in the United Kingdom as the country’s cost of living soars and its social security safety net falters following years of government austerity. With public services much weakened, charities like Little Village have stepped in.
The issue is firmly under the spotlight this week as campaign groups call on Britain’s Labour government to prioritize measures to reduce child poverty in its annual budget, which will be unveiled on Wednesday.
Around one-third of Britain’s children – about 4.5 million – now live in relative poverty, often measured as living in a household that earns below 60% of the national median income after housing costs, a governmentreportpublished in April found.
One million of these children are destitute, going without their most basic needs of staying warm, dry, clothed and fed being met, according to a 2023 study by theJoseph Rowntree Foundation, which studies poverty and formulates policy to tackle it.
“We came across one family that were just existing on cornflakes and rice,” Little Village chief executive Sophie Livingstone told CNN.
“We have lots of families who are in one room, lots of mold, lots of very poor-quality housing even when people are housed,” she added.
Even for families that are able to meet their children’s basic needs, life is a month-to-month struggle, without any financial security.
“You just live in fear all the time and that’s not a fun place to be when you’ve got children relying on you,” Lia, a single mother to 7-year-old twin girls, told CNN after being connected through the Changing Realities Project, which documents parents living on low incomes. She asked to use a pseudonym to protect her family’s privacy.
“They want to do all the same things that their peers are doing… but the budget won’t allow that,” she said. After paying for essentials each month, she has no money left.
“Every single time I go out, I have to vigilantly and diligently make sure I’m not overspending. That’s a really anxiety-provoking situation to be in.”
A law graduate who lives in Hampshire, southeast England, Lia initially returned to work but says she would often be called mid-meeting by her childcare provider if one of her daughters, who has complex needs, dyspraxia and global developmental delay, was having a “tantrum or a meltdown.” She eventually had to quit her job.
“I go into survival mode,” she said. “I was in the (foster) care system growing up and I remember feeling so much struggle and angst like, ‘if I can just get through this, it’ll be ok.’ Yet still, that situation hasn’t changed; as much as I know I have a lot to offer and I try to be a good member of society, I still feel like no matter where I turn, there’s difficulty.”
And even for families earning well above the poverty line, the cost of housing and childcare, especially in London, can be so high that there is simply no money to spend on anything else. Around 70% of children living in poverty have at least one parent in work.
Childcare is more expensive in the UK than in most other wealthy countries – costing about 25% of a couple’s and about 60% of a single parent’s net household income, according to figures released by think tank The Institute for Fiscal Studies in 2022.
Jaffe, the mother who makes use of the Little Village baby bank, works full-time in client solutions and says she earns £45,000 ($59,000) a year to support herself and her three children – well above the UK’s average. Still, she says she is “struggling every month to make sure everything is paid, not able to save anything, not able to do things for my kids.”
After paying for essentials – rent, childcare, food and household bills – she is left with £192 (around $250) a month for emergencies and to save for the next month in case there’s an error in her next social security payment – something she says is a regular occurrence.
Although child poverty has always been present in the UK, the rate of it is rising – and much faster than in other wealthy countries. Between 2012 and 2021, it rose by almost 20%,UNICEFfound. Now, in 2025, the UK’s child poverty rate is higher than that of any European Union country except Greece, according to theResolution Foundation, a living standards think tank.
The organization estimates thatanother 300,000 childrenwill fall into poverty by 2030 if nothing changes.
The current poverty rate reflects inequalities present elsewhere in society, too. Almost half of children in Black and Asian communities are living in poverty, compared with 24% of White children, while children living in single-parent families or in families where someone is disabled are also more likely to live in poverty, figures from campaign organization theChild Poverty Action Groupshow.
Part of this rise is down to the same economic conditions afflicting other parts of the Western world – sluggish growth, and employment no longer offering the same financial security, as well as stubborn inflation that disproportionately affects essential goods and, therefore, people on low incomes.
But academics and advocates say policy decisions have also played a part. Britain’s public services were slashed by the center-right Conservative-led coalition and subsequent Conservative government in power from 2010 to 2024.
And as part of its austerity program, which aimed to reduce public spending in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the Conservatives introduced three policies that “are very largely responsible for the increase in child poverty today,” said Jonathan Bradshaw, an emeritus professor of social policy at the University of York who also served as one of the academic advisers to the current government’s upcoming child poverty strategy.
These limited the amount of welfare people are eligible to claim – one is an overall cap on the benefits a household can receive, another limits housing benefits and the third is a two-child benefit cap, meaning that parents cannot claim anything for their third or subsequent children born after 2017.
Charities and academics say it is this two-child benefit cap in particular that is largely responsible for Britain’s rising rates of child poverty.
“Most of the increase in child poverty has occurred in large families,” Bradshaw told CNN.
All this demonstrates the “inadequacy of the benefits system,” says Peter Matejic, chief analyst at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.
“If you tot up how much you need for food, energy, all these things, and look at how much (benefits are)… it’s below that level,” he told CNN.
When UN envoys Philip Alston and Olivier De Schutter visited the UK in 2018 and 2023, respectively, they both condemned the poverty they saw there, though De Schutter noted that the country conformed to a pattern of increasing inequality seen in other wealthy countries.
A spokesperson for the current Labour government, which has been in power since July last year, told CNN that “every child, no matter their background, deserves the best start in life.”
“We are investing £500 million in children’s development through the rollout of Best Start Family Hubs, extending free school meals and ensuring the poorest don’t go hungry in the holidays through a new £1 billion crisis support package.”
Addressing child poverty has been a stated priority for the center-left government and, at the same time, an issue that illuminates the fault lines within it.
Ever since Labour came to power, it has grappled with balancing the mandate for change on which it was elected, and its traditional inclination to invest in public services, with scant available funds and a manifesto pledge not to increase taxes on working people.
Its plans to reduce child poverty have thus far been stymied by this conundrum. More details of the government’s spending and tax plans are due to be unveiled Wednesday, in which Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the UK’s finance minister, is expected to address the two-child benefit cap, a policy the government has oscillated between keeping and scrapping for the past year.
But for parents already on the breadline, their household budgets have been stretched too thin, for too long.
“People have got no resilience left,” says Livingstone, remembering that when she first began her role as the head of Little Village “we were talking about the safety net having lots of holes in it.”
“I’m actually not sure that there is much of a safety net anymore,” she says."
The hottest new AI company is…Google?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/29/tech/ai-chips-google-gemini-3-tpu-nvidia,"Nov 29, 2025, 7:01 AM ET","Google just threw another twist in the fast-changing AI race. And its biggest competitors are taking notice.
“We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google,” Nvidiawrotein a November 25 post on X, before adding that “NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs,” (the application-specific integrated circuits) like those made by Google.
“Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman alsowrote on X.
The posts came just days after mounting buzz about Google’s Gemini 3 model — andthe Google-made chipsthat help to power it. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioffwrote on Xthat he’s not going back to ChatGPT after trying Google’s new model. “The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again,” he wrote.
Now Meta is said to be in talks with Google about buying its Tensor chips, according toThe Information, coming afterAnthropic saidin October that it plans to significantly expand its own use of Google’s technology.
Shares of Google were up nearly 8% last week, while Nvidia’s were down a little over 2%.
At stake is more than just bragging rights or a few sales contracts. As the tech industry claims AI will reshape the world — including investment portfolios belonging to everyone from billionaires to 401k-holding retirees — what company and what vision comes out on top could affect nearly every American.
At face value, Nvidia’s post says the company isn’t worried about Google encroaching on its territory. And for good reason — Google’s chips are fundamentally different from Nvidia’s offerings, meaning they aren’t a match-for-match alternative.
But that OpenAI and Nvidia felt the need to acknowledge Google at all is telling.
“They’re in the lead for now, let’s call it, until somebody else comes up with the next model,” Angelo Zino, senior vice president and technology lead at CFRA, told CNN.
Google and Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nvidia declined to comment.
Google is hardly an AI underdog. Along with ChatGPT, Gemini is one of the world’s most popular AI chatbots, and Google is one of the few cloud providers large enough to be known as a “hyperscaler,” a term for the handful of tech giants that rent out cloud-based computing resources to other companies on a large scale. Google services like Search and Translate have used AI as far back as the early 2000s.
Even so, Google was largely caught flat-footed by OpenAI’s ChatGPT when it arrived in 2022. Google management reportedly issued a “code red” in December 2022 following ChatGPT’s seemingly overnight success, according toThe New York Times. ChatGPT now has at least 800 million weekly active users, according to its maker, OpenAI, while Google’s Gemini app has 650 million monthly active users.
But Gemini 3, which debuted on November 18, now sits at the top ofbenchmark leaderboardsfor tasks like text generation, image editing, image processing and turning text into images, putting it ahead of rivals like ChatGPT, xAI’s Grok and Anthropic’s Claude in those categories.
Google said over one million users tried Gemini 3 in its first 24 hours through both the company’s AI coding program and the tools that allow digital services to connect to other apps.
But people tend to use different AI models for different purposes, says Ben Barringer, the global head of technology research at investment firm Quilter Cheviot. For example, models from xAI and Perplexity are ranked higher than Gemini 3 search performance in benchmark tests.
“It doesn’t necessarily mean (Google parent) Alphabet is going to be … the end-all when it comes to AI,” said Zino. “They’re just kind of another piece to this AI ecosystem that continues to get bigger.”
Google began making its Tensor chips long before the recent AI boom. But Nvidia still dominates in AI chips with the company reporting 62% year-over-year sales growthin the October quarterand profits up 65% compared to a year ago.
That’s largely because Nvidia’s chips are powerful and can be used more broadly. Nvidia and its chief rival, AMD, specialize in chips known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, which can perform vast amounts of complex calculations quickly.
Google’s Tensor chips are ASICs, or chips that are custom-made for specific purposes.
While GPUs and Google’s chips can both be used for training and running AI models, ASICs are usually designed for “narrower workloads” than GPUs are designed for, Jacob Feldgoise, senior data research analyst at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, told CNN in an email.
Beyond the differences in the types of chips themselves, Nvidia provides full technology packages to be used in data centers that include not just GPUs, but other critical components like networking chips.
It also offers a software platform that allows developers to tailor their code so that their apps can make better use of Nvidia’s chips, a key selling point for hooking in long-term customers. Even Google is an Nvidia client.
“If you look at the magnitude of Nvidia’s offerings, nobody really can touch them,” said Ted Mortonson, technology desk sector strategist at Baird.
Chips like Google’s won’t replace Nvidia anytime soon. But increased adoption of ASICs, combined with more competition from AMD, could suggest companies are looking to reduce their reliance on Nvidia.
And Google won’t be the only AI chip competitor, said Barringer of Quilter Cheviot, and it’s doubtful it will achieve Nvidia’s dominance.
“I think it’s a part of a balance,” he said."
Crypto remains on edge. That could be bad news for the stock market,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/01/economy/us-stock-market-bitcoin-yen,"Dec 1, 2025, 1:13 PM ET","Crypto had arough November. The pain is persisting into December — and that could signal trouble ahead for the stock market.
Bitcoin has slumped more than 6% in the past 24 hours, sliding from just above $91,000 to roughly $85,600 as of Monday afternoon. The cryptocurrency sold off sharply late Sunday — tumbling more than $4,000 in just a few hours — as December trading kicked off in Asia.
Bitcoin has seen intense swings in recent weeks asrisk-off sentimenthas spread through markets. In addition to a risk-averse mood, the latest freakout in the crypto world stems from concerns about the unwinding of a popular trading strategy.
So, what’s going on?
The Bank of Japan has signaled it could raise interest rates at its policy meeting later this month. That is throwing a wrench into a trading strategy that relies on borrowing relatively cheap Japanese yen.
For years, a lucrative trade for global investors has been to borrow yen to buy high-yielding assets like US stocks, or in this case, cryptocurrencies. Interest rates in Japan had been low or at zero, making borrowing yen relatively cheap and creating a sweet opportunity for traders. It’s known as the “yen carry trade.”
However, the Bank of Japan has signaled it could raise interest rates, in part to address stubborn inflation, continuing a recent shift away from years of ultra-low rates. Yields on benchmark Japanese bonds just hit their highest level since 2008, signaling expectations for higher rates. As rates in Japan rise, it can boost the value of the yen. That makes borrowing yen less affordable, eating into the profitability of the carry trade.
That could pressure traders to sell their bitcoin and stocks now to repay their loans and prevent the risk of further losses. In addition to a sell-off, it could lead to less cash flowing into crypto and stocks.
“This raises questions about the unwinding of the yen carry trade … which would drain liquidity from the system,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, said in a note. “That would not be good for the stock market.”
Bitcoin dipped below $84,000 Monday morning before paring some losses in the afternoon. US stocks closed lower: The Dow fell 427 points, or 0.9%. The S&P 500 fell 0.53%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.38%.
For crypto, the sell-off has been widespread: Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has tumbled almost 9% in the past 24 hours.
Bitcoin’s tumble comes on the heels of asteep sell-offin crypto markets just weeks ago. Bitcoin in late November fell to just above $80,000 — down roughly 35% from a record high above $126,000 in early October.
The slide in bitcoin led stocks lower and, in particular, thetech stocksthat had been carrying the market. The S&P 500 fell almost 5% at one point in November before rallying and slighting gaining for the month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its first losing month since March.
Markets are “not out of the woods quite yet,” Maley said.
“The renewed decline in bitcoin could create some real problems for the stock market,” he said in a note. “If the issues which are creating this decline do not subside, the year-end rally scenario will run into some real headwinds.”
In a sign of the risk-off mood, investors are again piling in to gold and silver, which are considered safe havens amid uncertainty. The price of silver hit a record high on Monday as investors scooped up the metal, which can be considered a cheaper alternative to gold.Silver priceshave doubled this year, and have also been boosted by increased industrial demand.
Proponents of bitcoin say volatility is part of the journey. Meanwhile, critics say bitcoin is falling short of its proposed use as a store of value, given its susceptibility to intense fluctuations. Bitcoin is now down roughly 9% this year, while the S&P 500 is up roughly 16%, and gold is up almost 62%.
All things considered, the S&P 500 is less than 2% below a record high set in late October. December is a historically strong month for markets, and Wall Street is leaning in to bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month, which could boost stocks. However, more volatility could be in store as bitcoin languishes more than 30% below its record high and nerves linger about the yen carry trade.
“With all of this in mind, we’re still at a key juncture for the stock market,” Maley said. “The developments out of Japan are creating some uncertainty about a year-end rally … so the ‘all clear’ flags are not flying high just yet.”"
You’re paying more for less this shopping season. Now there’s proof,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/01/business/black-friday-shoppers-holiday-season,"Dec 1, 2025, 12:59 PM ET","Black Friday once again proved that Americans are willing to shop when they spot bargains.
Mastercard reported a steady 4.1%increase in US retail sales on Black Fridayand Adobe Analytics said online shopping surged by 9.1%. Salesforce expects Cyber Monday sales to also climb by 4%.
All of that is a pretty solid showing, given thegloom and doomin economic polls,crumbling consumer confidenceand mounting frustrations over the cost of living.
However, beneath the surface of those strong headline numbers lies a disturbing trend: Americans are spending more but getting less.
Although overallUS online shopping increased 3% on Black Friday, it was driven by a 7% jump in the average selling price, according to Salesforce.
Order volume, which measures how much was bought in a certain time frame, alsodeclined 1% versus Black Friday 2024, Salesforce said.
And shopping carts were smaller on Black Friday, as units per transaction dropped by 2%.
“Consumers are paying more per item than last year, but it’s not stopping them from coming out and spending,” Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights at Salesforce, told CNN in a phone interview.
Overall, prices during Cyber Week have risen 7% on average, according to Salesforce, higher than the 5% jump last year.
Salesforce blamed the price hikes at least in part on historic tariff hikes.
The Trump administration has spiked tariffs on US imports to the highest level since 1935, according toThe Budget Lab at Yale.
While it’s difficult to definitively attribute how much of the price hikes are linked to tariffs, some of the categories experiencing the biggest price increases are exposed to tariffs.
For instance, online average selling prices on home goods (furniture, appliances, dining, art & decor) spiked 24% on Black Friday, according to Salesforce.
President Donald Trumpslapped tariffson some types of furniture in October, as well as on countries where America imports furniture from, such as Vietnam, Indonesia and India.
Salesforce said online prices also jumped by 6% on clothes and 7% on electronics — two categories of products that America heavily imports.
Trump warned earlier this year that tariffs could mean Americans get less stuff.
“All I’m saying is that a young lady, a 10-year-old girl, 9-year-old girl, 15-year-old girl, doesn’t need 37 dolls,”Trump said in May.
Salesforce didn’t break down how much prices went up or down for toys, the majority of which the US imports from China.
Another factor that could be driving up prices: Consumers are leaning into higher-priced categories such as luxury and home goods, according to Schwartz.
Of course, the Black Friday sales results don’t reveal a key piece of information: who is doing all that shopping.
The rise of a K-shaped economy has meant that while many higher-income consumers are shopping aggressively, some less affluent Americans are cutting back as they grapple with the high cost of living andrising unemployment.
Before the holiday shopping season got underway, lower-income Americans signaled plans they would do some significant belt-tightening.
According toGallup, Americans in households earning less than $50,000 planned to spend $651 on holiday gifts, down from $776 last year.
Even middle-income Americans planned to cut back spending to $847, down from $902 last year. By contrast, high-income consumers planned to ramp up holiday spending to $1,479, up modestly from $1,403 last year.
Salesforce found evidence that consumers continue to be very price sensitive, prompting stores to discount more heavily over the weekend.
“Consumers did pull back at first, but as discounting increased, demand started to kick back in over the weekend,” said Schwartz.
Lured by those deeper discounts, US order volume turned positive over the weekend, rising by 2% on Saturday and Sunday, according to Salesforce. Overall sales growth increased by 5%.
“Consumers waited — and they were smart to wait,” Schwartz said.
Looking ahead, Salesforce is projecting $13.4 billion in US online shopping sales on Monday, up 4% from last year. The deepest discounts are expected to be for home (26%), health & beauty (35%) and clothes (37%).
Only time will tell whether those deals will be deep enough to lure consumers grappling with a years-long case of sticker shock."
Buying a home isn’t affordable in many metro areas. What about yours?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/27/us/housing-costs-affordability-metro-areas-vis,"Sep 27, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","The cost of owning a home in the US has surged since the Covid-19 pandemic. The median home price in August was $413,000, up from $321,000 during the same month in 2020 — a 28% increase, according tofederal data.
To better understand this strain on some families, CNN turned to ahome ownership affordability indexpublished by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. It measures the affordability for median-income households across the US who are hoping to buy a median-priced home in a given area.
The index compares the actual median household income to the “qualified” income needed to keep annual housing costs at or below 30%.
An index score of 100 or higher indicates the median household income is enough to afford the median-priced home based at that threshold. A score less than 100 means the median income is not enough for a median-priced home.
CNN is tracking this index as it’s periodically updated by the Atlanta Fed. Look up your area to see the trends over time — and how they compare with the national average.
The Atlanta Fed’s housing data is available at both the national level and for individual core-based statistical areas, or CBSAs. It’s updated monthly, though there’s typically a two-month lag — mainly because of the time it takes to record and collect home sales deeds. In some regions, the data can show noticeable fluctuations due to seasonal changes in median home prices or shifts in the volume of sales used to calculate those medians.
The Atlanta Fed’s data comes from itsHome Ownership Affordability Monitor, or HOAM. It factors in the monthly principal and interest cost, given the current mortgage interest rates, as well as taxes, property insurance and private mortgage insurance in the total cost of home ownership.
“The HOAM index is designed to easily track affordability over time in the United States across geographies,” said Domonic Purviance, a real estate expert with the Atlanta Fed who helped develop thetool.
The center of gravity on affordability has shifted dramatically across the country during the last five years, according to a CNN analysis of the data.
Most metropolitan areas are now on the more expensive side of the threshold.
This nationwide shift varies by region.
Today, most metropolitan areas in the West, for example, are too expensive for the median household under the income threshold. The Midwest has gotten dramatically more expensive, too."
35 million tons of food go to waste yearly in the US. Experts share tips to help stop it,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/27/health/reduce-food-waste-kitchen-wellness,"Nov 27, 2025, 11:01 AM ET","Millions of tons of food are wasted each year in the United States alone.
About 35 million tons, to be specific, according to thelatest ReFED report. Some31%of food that is grown and produced goes unsold or uneaten in the US, estimates ReFED, a nonprofit organization focused on reducing food waste.
Half of all the food waste comes from consumers. “That’s either groceries — the strawberries that spoil in your fridge — or the meal you ordered at the restaurant and only ate half of or didn’t eat the leftovers when you brought them home,” said Sara Burnett, executive director of ReFED.
That waste wreaks havoc on our planet, she said, noting that 35 million tons of food waste “is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emission of 154 million metric tons of carbon, which is about the same as driving 36 million passenger cars for a year, and it consumes 9 trillion gallons of water, which is about 13 million Olympic-sized pools.”
On Thanksgiving alone, ReFED estimated that320 million pounds of food— $550 million worth— will be thrown away in a single day.
The amount of waste is not decreasing even as inflation and food prices rise, according to Burnett, and the cost of being wasteful goes up.
We owe it to our wallets and to the planet to do our darndest to reduce any possible waste. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to preserve fresh ingredients for long-term consumption — by drying, freezing, canning, pickling, baking and repurposing them.
We asked 6 chefs for their secrets to reduce food waste — and we’re stealing their tips ASAP
“When I was first learning to cook, if a recipe told me to cut off and discard a kale stem, I did it. I didn’t know it was edible, and I didn’t know about the impacts of wasting food,” said Lindsay-Jean Hard, a writer for gourmet food business group Zingerman’s and author of “Cooking With Scraps: Turn Your Peels, Cores, Rinds, and Stems Into Delicious Meals.”
“Education is a huge piece: questioning our assumptions, educating ourselves, and then sharing that knowledge with others so we can all do a little better,”she noted.
Here are some useful ways to stop wasting food.
Chef Michele Casadei Massari suggested implementing simple systems at home that work for you such as an “opportunity box” in the fridge, containing “trimmed, labeled bits ready to become soup, salad, or frittata.”
“Buy less but more often, store correctly, pre-portion, and give every item a ‘next-life plan’ the day it arrives,” Massari, CEO and executive chef of Lucciola Italian Restaurant in Manhattan, said via email.
Hard takes those scraps and tucks them into frittatas and stratas.
“Both are great back-pocket recipes, (which means) they’re easy to pull together… and can handle all sorts of odds and ends.”
Getting ‘scrappy’ with food waste could save families more than $1,000 a year
Her advice for diving deeper into zero-waste cooking is to pick one or two ingredients you are not used to using, maybestale breador root vegetable greens, and start incorporating them in your cooking — then add more as you go. (Remember bits of bread can be frozen for other recipes, and vegetables can be pickled or frozen for stock.)
“Many home cooks are already really thoughtful about food utilization, whether from necessity, growing up around it, or being taught. Others of us might not be yet,” she said. But we can get there.
Claire Dinhut, a content creator and author of “The Condiment Book: Unlocking Maximum Flavor With Minimal Effort,” is a big proponent of using every last bit of flavor in any jarred or bottled product you have on hand. She demonstrates this strategy in her “never rinse a jar” videos that she posts on social media.
The world wastes more than 1 billion meals every day as hundreds of millions go hungry, UN report finds
A nearly used up jar of Dijon mustard or mayonnaise is the perfect opportunity to make a salad dressing, she shows in the videos, and an almost empty jam jar can become the perfect vessel for a yogurt bowl, a chia seed pudding and much more.
“My favorite thing that I’ve been doing this summer is — you know, I’ve always loved matcha, but I didn’t realize that I liked different flavored ones,” Dinhut said. “So now, anytime I’m done with a jar of jam or jelly, I always put milk in it the night before, then the next morning, I already have a nice, flavored milk.”
It’s important to question any recipe and our ideas around the usable parts of each ingredient. Who says you need to peel potatoes or carrots?
“Having a sense of curiosity and questioning your habits — do you really need to peel that carrot? —  is a helpful frame of mind to go into it with,” Hard said.
How food markdown apps are saving tons of food from the trash
Scraps can even act as flavor enhancers of their own, as in the case of a banana bread recipe from Zingerman’s Bakehouse, an artisanal bakery in Ann Arbor, Michigan,    that uses the whole banana, peel included, Hard said.
“Not only does it reduce food waste, including the peel gives the bread a stronger banana flavor, but it’s a great example of something that truly does taste better made with ‘scraps,’” she added.
You can find the Oh So A-peel-ing Banana Bread recipe in “Celebrate Every Day,” a Zingerman’s cookbook that Hard coauthored. A version of the recipe is also availablehere.

Trump says he’s decided on his pick for Fed chair. Here’s who’s who on the short list,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/business/fed-chair-pick-trump-short-list-vis,"Oct 28, 2025, 7:43 AM ET","President Donald Trump said he has decided who will become the most powerful figure in the US economy.
The president on Sunday said he made up his mind and will be making an announcement. The looming nomination caps a months-long search process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who provided Trump with a short list of five people.
Few people wield as much influence over financial markets and the global economy as the head of the US central bank. A few words from the Fed chair can move markets and shift billions of dollars. It’s a role so consequential that Trump has even mused about taking it for himself.
Trump has made no secret of his distaste for Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May. Trump has, at various points, said he would fire Powell or force him to resign; berated him for not lowering interest rates; and called on the Fed’s Board of Governors to oust him. Now, finally, Trump has an opportunity to reshape the central bank in his own image — and he is seizing it.
If Trump makes his announcement by the end of the year, it would be the earliest any president has announced a Fed chair nominee before the incumbent steps down.
Bessent said last week that there is a “very good chance” Trump will announce his pick before Christmas.
Whoever Trump picks will be subject to confirmation by the Republican-controlled Senate, and will lead the central bank as it juggles competing priorities after the administration’s sweeping economic policies raised the risk of higher inflation and weaker economic growth. Fed policymakers arecurrently dividedon how Trump’s policies are affecting the economy.
Here’s who’s who on the administration’s short list for the top job at the Fed."
"Trump’s new executive order brings together Big Tech, academics and the government on AI research",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/24/tech/ai-executive-order,"Nov 24, 2025, 5:34 PM ET","The White House on Monday launched a new program to allow the Department of Energy’s national laboratories to collaborate with tech companies and academics on using AI to further scientific research.
Under the new Genesis Mission, created by executive order, the Department of Energy will develop a new AI platform that uses federal scientific data to train AI models and agents made for scientific research. It underscores President Donald Trump’s focus on AI in his second term, coming after he’s introduced a sweeping package of initiatives and policy recommendations in July called theAI Action Plan.
The Genesis Mission aims to take the tech and business industries’ progress in AI and apply it to scientific research in health, energy, manufacturing and other fields, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on a call with reporters on Monday. He also said the program would lower energy prices for consumers, a key challenge as investment in AI have increased this year.
The DoE’s laboratories have been conducting research in everything from energy to health, applied materials and quantum science for decades. But a new platform under the initiative will let DoE labs, private companies and academic institutions share information more easily. That, in turn, will help researchers apply AI to areas like physics and chemistry.
“The private sector has launched artificial intelligence at huge scale, but with a little bit different focus, on language, on business, on processes, on consumer services.” Wright said. “What we’re doing here is just pivoting those efforts to focus on scientific discovery, engineering advancements.”
A key part of accomplishing that goal, according to Wright, is opening up access to data sets from the DoE’s national labs, which include facilities such as the Ames National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory among many others.
The platform will allow “multiple Federal research agencies” and “the private sector” to collaborate in order to “win and stay ahead in the AI race,”according to a White House fact sheet.
Key focus areas for the program include biotechnology, critical materials, nuclear fission and fusion energy, space exploration, quantum information science, and semiconductors and microelectronics.
Tech giants have already been working more closely with the DoE; Nvidia and Oracleannounced a partnershipin October to build supercomputers for Argonne National Laboratory. PC maker Dell is also developing a supercomputer for use at Berkeley Lab, according toa May announcement.The Genesis Mission is designed to facilitate more of those types of deals.
Tech companies and academics have also been researching the use of AI in health for years; Google introduceda family of AI modelsfine-tuned for the healthcare industry in 2023.
But the push to use AI in scientific research also comes as the technology stillgrapples with hallucinations, or a tendency for the tech to make things up.
The directive also strikes at a critical issue brought up by the AI boom: the toll it could take on energy grids. Residential electricity costsare on the rise, with the average price of electricity in America increasing 13% since 2022. Data centers, which are critical for powering AI services and training AI models, are expected to consume approximately 6.7% to 12% of US electricity in 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023, according to a report from theDepartment of Energy.
Wright said the program would “make our electricity grid more efficient and reverse price rises that have infuriated American citizens.”
But doing so won’t be an easy task; power grids are already in need of updating and maintenance, especially in the face of severe weather events. And the rate at which AI is advancing could make it increasingly difficult for the energy industry to keep up as tech giants pour billions into new data centers.
The executive order is just the latest Trump initiative to accelerate US AI development. Just last week, Trump spoke at theSaudi-US investment forum in Washington, where a flurry of partnerships were announced between American tech companies and Humain AI, a tech company backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.
The White House has also introduced unconventional arrangements that involve government dealings with private businesses as part of Trump’s push for American AI dominance. The US governmenttook a 10% stake in chipmaker Intelin August and struck a deal with AMD and Nvidiato take a 15% cut of chip sales to Chinain exchange for export licenses.
At the heart of Trump’s AI blitz is a desire to stay ahead of China in the AI race astrade tensions bubble between the two economic powerhouses. Chinese tech startup DeepSeek rattled US markets in January with the arrival of its R1 model, sparking fear that China may be further ahead in AI than previously expected.
Trump and some tech giantslike OpenAIhave argued that state-level regulation could slow innovation. Trump recently drafteda separate executive orderaimed at preventing such regulation, after Congress shot down a previous effort to block state-level AI regulations.
But easing regulation has raised safety concerns from lawmakers and online safety advocates after a series of reports this year indicated AI could contribute toself-harmandmental distress."
Trump is threatening to get rid of one of the biggest reasons prices have remained in check,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/economy/trump-usmca-tariffs-prices,"Dec 5, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","When President Donald Trump introduced his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, many economistspredictedAmericans would soon experience massive price increases. While inflationhas ticked upin the eight months that passed, it’s been nowhere near levels initially projected.
A big reason for that: Nearly everything from clothing to toothpaste produced by America’s top two trading partners, Mexico and Canada, has been exempt from duties if goods comply with the terms of a trilateral free-trade agreement known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), whichTrump inked during his first term.
But the deal, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, is scheduled to undergo a review in July, and already Trump is signaling he wants out. If that happens, it likely would usher in a floodgate of higher prices from which Americans have so far been shielded.
“We’ll either let it expire or we’ll maybe work out another deal with Mexico and Canada,” Trump said Wednesday. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also said in a Politico interview, “the reason why we built a review period into USMCA was in case we needed to revise it, review it or exit it.”
The president’s stance could change between now and July, and the White House told CNNthat. “Discussion about what hypothetical trade deals that have not yet been negotiated could look like is meaningless speculation,” spokesman Kush Desai said.
Prior to Trump’s second term, goods from Mexico and Canada essentially entered the US duty-free even if they weren’t USMCA compliant because there weren’t tariffs in place. But Trump introduced tariffs of 25% on non-USMCA-compliant products from Mexico and 35% from Canada.
Trump’s trade war is pushing Canada closer to China
Unlike those two countries, every other nation’s exports to the United States have been subject to higher tariffs over the past year, barring exemptions for certain goods. Those rates at one point went as high as 145% in the case of China.
Prior to Trump’s second term, goods from Mexico and Canada essentially entered the US duty-free even if they weren’t USMCA compliant because there weren’t tariffs in place. That helps explain why 38% of imports from Canada and 49% of imports from Mexico were USMCA compliant last year, according to US Commerce Department data. But as of August this year, those shares rose to nearly 86% of imports from Canada and 87% of imports from Mexico.
“Increased compliance with USMCA has shielded billions of dollars’ worth of imports from the new tariffs,” said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation.
If USMCA exemptions weren’t in place, “Americans would face significantly higher prices,” she said. “That would make American workers poorer and American businesses less competitive, and for no good reason.”
Consumer electronics and clothing are among the goods that could be most vulnerable to price increases, given that the United States has become more reliant on its neighbors for such items.
Additionally, supply chains across all three countries havegrown more intertwined, with components often crossing the American border multiple times during the assembly process. That means that even apparel and electronics, as well as other domestically produced goods, could be impacted by potentially higher tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and get passed on to consumers.
“USMCA is a cornerstone of North America’s electronics manufacturing ecosystem. Terminating it would disrupt the production system that US manufacturers rely on, leading to longer lead times and higher input costs,” said Chris Mitchell, vice president for global government relations at the Global Electronics Association. “Those pressures would ultimately translate into higher prices for automotive, consumer, and medical electronics.”"
Why the crypto market is crashing,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/24/business/why-the-crypto-market-is-crashing,"Nov 24, 2025, 4:26 PM ET","Even bycrypto standards, it’s been a rough few weeks.
Investors in digital assets are accustomed to extreme volatility, but a $1 trillion wipeout over the past six weeks has tested even crypto’s diehard believers and alienated many of its newest converts.
Bitcoin, the industry bellwether, has fallen dramatically since early October, when it hit a record high of $126,000. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency dipped below $81,000 on Friday before recovering slightly over the weekend. On Monday, as the broader stock market rallied, bitcoin topped $88,000, rising nearly 2% over a 24-hour period. (Crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.)
It is shaping up to be one of crypto’s worst months on record, and it’s not clear the market has bottomed out.
Why crypto briefly but dramatically crashed when Trump renewed his trade war
“Whether Bitcoin stabilizes after this correction remains uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote Monday. “Unlike prior crashes, driven primarily by retail speculation, this year’s downturn has occurred amid substantial institutional participation, policy developments, and global macro trends.”
While crypto’s fate has broadly mirrored the stock market’s in recent years, its current angst runs deeper. That’s largely thanks to an influx of mainstream money that behaves very differently from the funds controlled by a typical crypto investor.
Bitcoin is in a bear market, having dropped 30% from its most recent high, while the S&P 500 is down just 3% from its most recent peak. It is on track for its worst month since the 2022 crypto “winter” that culminated in the collapse ofSam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.
Anxiety is coursing through stocks and crypto for two key reasons: Investors are fretting overthe Federal Reserve’s next rate cut, and they’re worrying about whether AI is abubblethat’ll blow up in their faces.
All of that weighs on crypto traders because digital assets, like tech stocks, are especially sensitive to changes in the Fed’s benchmark rate, which affects the cost of borrowing money and can quickly sap investor appetite for risk.
But crypto investors have an additional hangover to deal with following anOctober 10 flash crash. When President Donald Trump reignited his trade war with China that day, it prompted a wave of panic-selling that triggered automatic liquidations across the highly leveraged crypto market. In a single day, the flash crashed wiped out $19 billion worth of crypto. For a lot of folks, the stomach-churning crash was all the motivation they needed to exit crypto completely, and that’s left bitcoin and other tokens more susceptible to volatility.
The flash crash forced many investors sell their holdings to meet margin calls. That tends to have a snowball effect: The more bitcoin falls, the more calls investors face from their brokerages, the more they have to sell their bitcoin (and other holdings) to cover their positions.
What makes this crypto crash different is the presence of billions of dollars that have entered the crypto market through spot bitcoin funds that US regulators approved last year.
Mainstream investors got into crypto to enjoy the ride up, but they don’t have the same level of devotion to the ideology as early adopters who are bolstered by intense online communities encouraging one another to buy the dip and keep the faith.
“The bottom line is, bitcoin is for normies now,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told me. “As a result, the normies are going to view it as another speculative holding in their portfolio … it’s going to be treated like a volatile mainstream investment.”"

Selling up your homeand leaving friends and family behind for a new life overseas is a major move which requires serious research before taking the plunge.
The monthly magazine and website International Living has just released itsAnnual Global Retirement Index, which evaluates the world’s top destinations for retirees across categories including cost of living, healthcare, housing, visas, climate, and ease of integration.
The new No.1 for 2026 is a sun-soaked country in Southern Europe whose thousands of picturesque islands have made it a tourism hot spot, but International Living says it has everything it takes for a permanent stay as well.
“Greece’s rise to number one marks a shift in Europe’s retirement landscape,” says Jennifer Stevens, executive editor of International Living. “For years, Portugal and Spain led the way, but recent visa changes and rising costs have retirees looking elsewhere. Greece now offers what many are seeking — a beautiful, welcoming, and affordable European base with accessible residency options and a lifestyle that feels rich in every sense.”
Here’s a look at the top 10 countries in the 2026 index, which is based on recent data, plus input from International Living’s global network of more than 200 experts and expats.
Greece’s Golden Visa program, granting a residence permit to foreigners making a minimum real estate investment of 250,000 euros (about $290,000), is one of Europe’s most accessible, says International Living. It also scored highly on climate, healthcare and housing.
Patricia Mahan and Dan Matarazzo, from the US, bought a two-bedroom house for $150,000 in Kritsa, a village in Crete, in 2023. “We wanted to move by the sea,” Mahantold CNNlast year. “In an affordable place.”
The other priorities that influenced their decision were that they “wanted village life” but “needed to be near amenities like state-of-the-art medical facilities, a nearby airport, weekly farmers’ markets  and supermarkets and stores of all kinds to furnish our house.”

Panama is the frontrunner across all countries in the index’s visa/retiree benefits category. It has long been courting US retirees and its Pensionado Program offers impressive perks: 50% off entertainment, 30% off transport, 25% off airfares, 15% off medical bills, and discounts on everything from electricity to eating out.
“Panama’s healthcare system rivals the US in quality — without the price tag,” the International Index report says. “A hospital stay that might cost $30,000 in Miami could be $3,200 here, including CT scans and medication.”
CNN Travel chosePanamaas one of our best destinations to visit in 2024. We praised Panama City as the only world capital with a tropical rainforest within its city limits and also highlighted its old quarter, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The country also holds over a dozen national parks, including Parque Nacional Volcán Barú, the highest point in Panama.
Costa Rica was No. 1 in the index’s climate category and this is a country that takes its environment seriously. A full 25% of its landmass is protected rainforest, says International Living, and 99% of its power is from renewable energy. “It’s also one of the few nations to reverse deforestation, home now to 10,000 plant species and 850 kinds of birds,” the publication says.
Costa Rica’s Nicoya Peninsula is one of only five “blue zones” in the world, regions renowned for the longevity of their residents. While not yet at retirement age, US woman Kema Ward-Hopper moved with her family to Pueblo Nuevo in Nicoya in 2018, after she underwent treatment for breast cancer.
“The health benefits of the blue zone, I think, show up later in life,” shetold CNNin 2025. “But we have noticed that we feel better when we’re here. Our cardiac health and lung health seems to be better.”
Portugal is second only to France in the index’s healthcare category and also scores highly on climate and development/governance.
The country has ended its Golden Visa program for residential property development, but other investment visas remain. International Living says that for most retirees interested in moving to the country, “the standard D7 “passive income” visa is ideal — requiring proof of steady income rather than large investments (as little as $1,011 per month).”
Seattle woman Cynthia Wilson and her husband Craig Bjork were approved for the D7 visa and in 2022 they moved to the small town of Marinha Grande, located on the Silver Coast close to the famous surfing beach Nazaré.
“I will return to the US in an urn,” Wilsontold CNNin 2024. “For Americans, it is cheaper to live here, if you don’t live in Lisbon, Porto or the Algarve. Those places are like trying to live in San Francisco or Manhattan.”

“As many as one million Americans and Canadians already call Mexico home — the largest North American expat population anywhere on Earth,” says International Living.
Mexico scored highly in the categories for visas/retiree benefits and development and governance. International Living’s report says “the highways are excellent, the internet is fast, and the infrastructure is modern. Add to that a remarkably low cost of living, first-rate healthcare, and an easy path to residency.”
Janet Blaser, originally from New York, relocated from California to Mexico 20 years ago. “I got to Mazatlán, and it sounds so corny, but it just touched my heart,” shetold CNNearlier this year. “It was really easy to meet people,” she says. “So I felt really welcomed and like I could do this.”
Italy’s highest-scoring category in the index was the affinity rating, which is about ease of integration and what International Living calls “gut feeling,” as this is a decision that “involves the heart as well as the head.”
It also performed well in the healthcare category, matching Greece’s score of 89 out of 100.
Massachusetts couple Doug and Leah Johnson bought and renovated a 14th-century apartment in the town of Vasanello, located in the Italian region of Lazio. It cost them just 9,000 euros in 2019 (a little over $10,000).
“The amazing thing in Italy is that they really preserve old buildings. It’s not easy to knock down an important structure,” Dougtold CNNin 2023.
He also said they found the local people very welcoming. “I think much of it is the novelty of having Americans investing, and loving their community,” he says. “Sometimes we go into shops for a cappuccino, or loaf of bread, and they won’t let us pay.”
International Living praises France’s “renowned universal healthcare,” giving it a score of 97, the highest of any country on the index. However, that renown abroad is gaining notoriety at home; French lawmakers are currently consideringa proposalto end free healthcare for foreign pensioners and make them pay a minimum contribution.
Whatever the outcome, France is likely to remain a very attractive destination for retirees, with its winning combination of climate, culture and cuisine.
In December 2021, Mary Jane Wilkie ditched New York for Paris at the age of 79. Shetold CNNthis year that it was the best decision she’s ever made.
“Ultimately, I knew that I didn’t want to say on my deathbed, ‘I always wanted to move to France but didn’t’,” Wilkie said.“Once you know what you don’t want to say on your deathbed, you know what to do with your life.”

Healthcare (94) and affinity rating (90) are the categories in which Spain performed best, while cost of living (75) is a little weaker.
Indiana couple Regina and John Zdravich moved to Spain in 2018, eventually buying a home in Garcia, Catalonia, for 165,000 euros (around $184,000). They made the choice after hitting stumbling blocks on an attempted relocation to Italy.
The couple were granted Non-Lucrative visas, a permit that allows non-EU nationals to live in the country without working or engaging in any professional activity, for Spain.
Catalonia has its own public health system, which can be accessed by any of its residents.
“John had to have back surgery, we didn’t pay a penny,” Reginatold CNNin 2024. “You go and you buy a prescription, and you can use your pocket change.”
Thailand was one of the highest-scoring destinations in the cost of living category, with only Vietnam and Sri Lanka scoring higher. It also performed well on climate and development and governance.
American Jim Dolan and his wife Som built a home in Som’s native Thailand after their US property was flooded in a hurricane.
“Our finances were such that we couldn’t live what was thought to be our dream life,” Jimtold CNNin 2024. ““It was right around the time that I was just approaching retirement age. And so we just decided to make the move at that time.”
Jim was able to obtain a Thailand Marriage Visa and the couple then bought some land “sight unseen” in Sam Roi Yot, located in the province of Prachuap Khiri Khan, for around $50,000.
“It’s very quiet. Very peaceful. Very safe,” Jim said. “I feel safer here in Thailand than I think in any of the cities that I lived in the United States.”
He moved to Thailand with minimal savings. Now he plans incredible vacations for the rich and famous
Cost of living (94) and development and governance (90) are the categories Malaysia scored high on, but it had a relatively low score (45) on the affinity ranking.
“Malaysia offers a unique blend of modern infrastructure, cultural diversity, and natural
beauty. With its affordable cost of living and the Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) program, it’s an increasingly popular destination for retirees seeking a warm, tropical climate,” says International Living.
CNN Travel chose the island of Penang as one of ourdestinations to visit in 2022. We praised it for its cuisine, a wide mix of traditional Malay, Chinese and Indian dishes, and for the historic architecture found in its capital George Town. Penang Hill is a UNESCO Biosphere reserve filled with excellent hiking trails and more than 200 species of orchids."
"Americans under 30 are ‘under profound strain’ and deeply mistrust institutions, poll finds",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/politics/young-adults-political-views,"Dec 4, 2025, 9:39 AM ET","Young Americans are “a generation under profound strain” with little confidence in institutions and widespread economic concerns, according to aHarvard Institute of Politics surveyof adults younger than 30 released Thursday.
Young adults say, 57% to 13%, that things in the country are generally on the wrong track, rather than headed in the right direction. Just 32% describe the US as a healthy democracy or one that’s “somewhat functioning,” while 64% call it system in trouble or one that has completely failed.
The survey, which included 2,040 adults under the age of 30 and was conducted between November 3 and 7, 2025, sheds a light on the views of young Americans on the country’s economic and political situation.
“Young Americans are sending a clear message: the systems and institutions meant to support them no longer feel stable, fair, or responsive to this generation,” John Della Volpe, the director of polling at Harvard’s Institute of Politics, said in a statement. “Their trust in democracy, the economy, and even each other is fraying — not because they are disengaged, but because they feel unheard and unprotected in a moment of profound uncertainty.”
Seventy-two percent of respondents — including 88% of Democrats, 73% of Republicans and 66% of independents — say it’s at least somewhat important to them that America is a democracy. That’s a downtick from 78% overall in 2021, coming almost entirely from Republicans.
The poll finds thatPresident Donald Trump’s approval ratingcurrently stands at just 29% among adults under 30, with congressional Democrats and Republicans at a similarly low 27% and 26%, respectively.
Asked about their preference for the outcome of next year’s midterms, registered voters younger than 30 favor a Democratic-controlled Congress over a Republican one by a 17-point margin, 46% to 29%, with roughly one-quarter unsure.
Overall, only about half of all young adults say they will definitely or probably vote next year, and just 28% say they consider themselves to be politically engaged, though few say they’re completely tuned out of political news.
In an open-ended question about the national issue that concerns them most, 29% name economic issues, with 18% naming issues relating to government, politics and democracy and 10% mentioning immigration-related issues. Young adults are divided on their personal financial prospects, with 30% expecting to end up better off financially than their parents when they reach their parents’ age, 25% expecting to be worse off, and 26% expecting to be about the same.
The survey also finds that about one-third of young adults, 35%, say they regularly use generative AI platforms such asChatGPT,GeminiorClaude. By a 30-point margin, 44% to 14%, young adults expect AI to take away more opportunities from them than it creates, with the rest expecting no change or unsure about it.
The Harvard IOP poll used the nationally representative Ipsos KnowledgePanel, and the results have a margin of error of +/- 2.94% pts for the full sample."
Costco is poking the Trump bear,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/business/costco-trump-tariffs,"Dec 3, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Big public companies have mostly treated President Donald Trump with kid gloves during his second term. They’ve quietly avoided conflict while seeking favor with ornate gifts, large donations to his pet projects and strategic deployments of CEOs to the Oval Office.
That’s what made Costco’s decision last week tosue the Trump administrationso shocking.
Costco on Friday filed a lawsuit that contends Trump overstepped his emergency powers by imposing sweeping tariffs – and claimed the company is due a refund.
Costco isn’t alone. A handful of other companies have separately sued the government on similar grounds, including Bumble Bee Foods, Ray-Bans parent EssilorLuxottica, Revlon and Kawasaki Motors. But Costco is the highest profile public company to do battle with the Trump White House on tariffs.
Few major corporations have been willing to publicly stick their necks out to combat Trump’s policies since he took office in January. That stands in contrast to his first term, when businesses and their leaders felt more comfortable speaking out – most notably whenmultiple CEOs quit his business councilover comments Trump made in 2017 that downplayedneo-Nazi violencein Charlottesville, Virginia.
But Trump’s second term has largely been marked by Corporate America’s acquiescence. Several factors are at play:
But if businesses are going to start speaking out against Trump’s policies, tariffs may be the logical place to start.
Tariffs are broadly – and increasingly – unpopular with Americans, who connect them with the country’s affordability crisis.
A CBS Newspollconducted in late October found that just 38% of Americans favor the United States placing new tariffs on goods imported from other countries. A clear majority, 62%, oppose. That marks a significant reversal from November 2024, when Americans narrowly favored new tariffs by 52% to 48% in a CBS Newspollat that time.
Bigger picture, a poll published byFox Newslast month showed only 15% of respondents said Trump’s policies are helping their financial situation, compared to 46% who said they are hurting.
So Costco is probably not going to anger too many customers by speaking out against a trade policy that is unpopular in the first place.
Costco didn’t appear overly concerned: It used some choice words in its lawsuit, decrying “the pell-mell manner by which these on-again/off-again” tariffs were “threatened, modified, suspended, and re-imposed, with the markets gyrating in response.” The company didn’t say how much it paid in tariffs, but it demanded that they be refunded in full.
The Supreme Court appeared ready to declare the bulk of Trump’s tariffs illegal, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett declared the refund process would almost certainly be “a mess.” Costco, seeing the handwriting on the wall, is trying to get in line early to collect.
Also, Costco may be uniquely situated. For example, the companydoubled down on its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, or DEI, while many other companies rapidly abandoned them in the face of a pressure campaign from Trump and conservative media. And with its emphasis on value in the face of high prices, Costco has proven resilient with customers.
Going up against Trump’s tariffs has had mixed results. Some high-profile businesses that tried have been met with Trump’s wrath.
In April, White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt held up a photo of Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos in a press briefing andpublicly shamed the companyfor considering advertising tariff costs to customers. Trump similarlythreatened Walmartafter the company said it would raise prices because of tariffs.
In a variation on the theme, Apple said in May that it would shift its US iPhone production to India from China after Trump imposed steep tariffs that would cost itnearly $1 trilliona quarter. An upset Trump a couple weeks later in Qatar said he had “a little problem” with CEO Tim Cook because of Apple’s failure to bring iPhone production to the United States. By the end of the month, Trump hadthreatened a 25% tariffon Apple’s products.
But in August, Cook made a public appearance in the Oval Office, promising anadditional $100 billionin US investment, and presented Trump with a plaque with a24K gold base. The tariff threat vanished.
Still, with the Supreme Court decision looming and tariff popularity fading, some analysts believe Costco’s lawsuit could attract followers.
“I expect many other companies will do the same,” said Timothy Brightbill, a partner at Wiley who focuses on international trade.
Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, agreed, arguing that Costco could give permission for some companies on the fence to file suit.
But some companies will still hesitate, he predicted.
“My guess is the more business you have before the federal government, the less likely you are to sue,” said Mills."

The crypto industry got everything it wanted. It’s still having a meltdown,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/business/crypto-ben-mckenzie-nightcap,"Nov 25, 2025, 4:54 PM ET","A version of this story will appear in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.
This was supposed to be the year cryptocurrency, a 16-year-old asset that promised to be the future of finance, came into its own.
The multi-trillion-dollar industry got just about everything on its wish list over the past year:a rush of new moneyfrom mainstream investors, industry-approvedbipartisan legislationin Congress, a rubber-stampregulatory apparatus, and, not least, thefull-throated supportof the president of the United States.
Despite that, cryptohas had a rough ride, with bitcoin tumbling 30% from its peak in early October, a far steeper decline than the broader stock market.
Why the crypto market is crashing
One of the most prominent industry critics is the actor and author Ben McKenzie, who last week debuted his documentary,“Everyone Is Lying to You for Money,”at the New York documentary film festival DOC NYC. On Friday, I sat down (virtually) with McKenzie, who starred in TV shows such as “The OC” and “Gotham,” to talk about the market meltdown and his film’s well-timed New York premiere.
This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
CNN:Given all of crypto’s institutional support, I’m curious why we’re still seeing all this volatility?
Ben McKenzie:I think there are a few potential reasons. The first is that the economy isslowing down. And if you think of crypto as an investment in essentially nothing, computer code, it serves as sort of a proxy for the most speculative part of the market. It’s like the canary in the coal mine —when crypto crashes severely, it may be a sign that the broader economy is dipping.
The other reason is that the rise in crypto prices was fueled by companies buying bitcoin as a corporate strategy —MicroStrategy(now called Strategy) being by far the most prominent. But things are turning south for the company, its stock (MSTR) is down about 40% for the month, and people are concerned that it might have to sell its bitcoin.
The other problem with crypto is that people take on huge amounts of leverage to further their crypto bets. And when the price goes down and the de-leveraging starts, things collapse just as fast as they went up, if not faster. And that’s what’s scary about right now, to me, is the numbers just get bigger and bigger. But the volatility doesn’t really go away.
CNN:You’ve been outspoken in your view that crypto is fundamentally a scam. What do you say to crypto boosters who say, well, despite the volatility if you’d invested at almost any point in the past 10 years, you’d be sitting on huge gains?
McKenzie:You’re saying that, if you got in early on this thing that I and others have called a Ponzi scheme, then you would have profited. To which I say, correct. Yes, well done. It’s not quite the point that advocates think they’re making.
At the end of the day, it still comes back to the thing I say all the time, which is crypto — because there’s no underlying asset — is a zero-sum game. At best, your win comes from somebody else’s loss.
There’s a moral component to this that gets way outside of what we’re talking about in terms of making money on an investment. The amount of crime that crypto facilitates is truly staggering. You’re talking about money laundering to the tune ofbillions of dollars, influence peddling, terrorist financing.
So is it worth it for some people to win and everyone else to lose? To me, the answer is no.
CNN:Looking at the horizon, what, if anything, is keeping you up at night about the trajectory we’re on with crypto?
McKenzie:I had a bad feeling when Trump embraced crypto last summer, and then a worse feeling when he was elected, and then I’ve honestly been shocked athow muchgriftis going on.
But I am in a slightly better place recently… His poll numbers are starting to tank. The market is starting to tank. The economy is starting to slow down. And you know, if you study other countries and other collapses of unpopular leaders, he may be in for a ride here.
CNN:You’ve been a cryptoCassandrafor a few years now, and I’m wondering if you plan to stay in this lane or if you’re expanding into other areas of speculative market hype? In case it’s not obvious, I’m referring to AI… Is there an “Easy Money” Part 2 in the works?
McKenzie:I’m definitely tempted to swerve over to the AI lane, which is quite a lot wider at this point.
There’s a thing called the grift shift — it’s a time honored con-man tactic to sell someone on something that doesn’t quite work now, but in the future will be amazing. That’s worked for crypto, and that is certainly the pitch for AI. I will say, I’m not a proponent of where AI is heading per se, but in AI’s limited defense, there’s an actual thing that’s happening that actually has a function in the real world that isn’t gambling and crime."
Sleep banking helps you get some rest in advance,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/06/health/sleep-banking-explained-wellness,"Dec 6, 2025, 1:00 PM ET","Dr. Diego Ramonfaur is often sleep-deprived.
In his third year of an internal medicine residency at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, Ramonfaur faces schedule changes every one or two weeks. With workloads that vary depending on the rotation, going to sleep and waking up at a consistent time is impossible.
So Ramonfaur, 30, turned to sleep banking — a strategy of getting extra sleep that some people use before a time when they know they’ll be sleep-deprived.
When Ramonfaur’s shifts are lighter but he knows longer rotations are coming, he will often try go to bed earlier to “gain a little bit of ground,” he said. ”Investing in sleep, even before I am tired, has been very rewarding in improving my performance during the shift and also with helping with overall burnout.”
The practice is part of his overall burnout prevention strategy during a busy time in life, and he said he hopes it will pay off a few years from now during even more intense cardiology training.
Experts agreethat the recommended amount of sleep for adults isseven to nine hoursper night, and going to sleep and waking at the same times every day — even on weekends — is optimal for a good night’s rest.
But what if real life gets in the way? That’s where sleep banking comes in.
Referred to assleep extensionin scientific literature, sleep banking is “the practice of implementing a really healthy sleep schedule and making time for ample sleep duration so that you can build up your resilience as you enter periods of insufficient sleep,” said Dr. Rebecca Robbins, a sleep scientist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.
If worries keep you from falling back asleep, experts know what to try
Sleep banking is only something she would recommend for those who have work schedules or other constraints that limit their ability to sleep.
This category includes medical doctors andmembers of the militarywith mission critical assignments leaving them limited time to sleep. Robbins said sleep banking has been used to keep them as healthy as possible during difficult times.
The practice may benefit other people with compromised sleep patterns, she said, including students before exams and professionals approaching a busy stretch at work.
If you need an alarm clock or other assistance to wake up, you’re probably not getting enough sleep, said Dr. Yo-El Ju, a sleep physician scientist and professor of neurology at WashU Medicine in St. Louis.
Many people who are sleep-deprived probably have gotten used to it. “Most of us use alarm clocks to wake up,” Ju said. “I do, too. It’s not a moral failing.”
But the term sleep banking is a bit of a misnomer, she said.
“You can’t really bank sleep, but you can pay off the debt,” she said. It’s similar to using a credit card in that you pay off the balance of sleep debt a little bit so that you can spend more or stay awake longer.
These 3 exercises may help with insomnia, new study finds
When people know they won’t get enough sleep later on, they can make an effort to sleep more on the nights leading up to that period, Ju said. That starts to pay off the upcoming debt at just a day or two ahead of time but try at least a week (before the deprivation) for even better results.
“Getting up at the same time every day is also really healthy for our circadian rhythms. So ideally, you’d be waking up at the same time every day, but allowing yourself to go to bed earlier to get more sleep time,” said Ju, whosewebsiteprovides science-backed help for better sleep.
If you want to try sleep banking for a period, begin your bedtime routine earlier and try to fall asleep 15 minutes earlier each night before a period of sleep deprivation, Robbins said. That’s so you’re slowly adding about an hour and a half every week of extra time you could spend sleeping.
While studies show that sleep banking can improve cognition and recognition related tovigilant attentionwhen it comes to things such as spotting a stimulus (like a light) and responding to it quickly and without mistakes, the practice hasnot been provento help with executive functioning tasks, Ju said.
What to know about melatonin use and heart failure
Skills that you use to manage everyday tasks, executive functioning is critical for safety and important for most people’s daily lives, Ju said, as well as for the ability to function at work. An example in day-to-day life is driving, when you might be forced to look in the rearview mirror for people cutting you off while at the same time answering questions from your kids in the back seat.
Sleep banking should also be avoided by those who struggle with insomnia, Ju said, since lying awake in bed for long periods doesn’t treat your inability to sleep and can lead to even more frustration.
For people with relatively healthy sleep patterns, sleep banking can help weather an upcoming schedule with reduced sleep, Robbins said. But once you’re through that time, it’s important to return to a normal sleep schedule as soon as possible, she said.

When you’re back on track, consider setting a sleep alarm about an hour or two before bedtime, said Ju, who likes a reminder to turn down the lights and get off screens.
“We’re so busy in our day-to-day lives that we just go, go, go, go, go — and then we crash in bed and expect to fall asleep,” she said. “And most of us cannot do that. Our brains need a little bit of a wind-down before we can relax and fall asleep.”

One of Trump’s most consequential decisions just got more complicated,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/08/economy/trump-fed-chair-decision-complexities,"Dec 8, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump last week gave his strongest hint yet that he’s picked a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Investors have concerns.
After months of speculation over the names of the dozen or so candidates, Trump finally said last weekhe knows who he will nominateto be the most powerful figure in the US economy. Just days later during a Cabinet meeting, Trump singled out National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett as “a potential Fed chair,” adding, “Are we allowed to say that?”
The 10-year Treasury yield rose by 11 basis points after a report from Bloomberg on November 25 said Hassett wasthe “frontrunner” to head the central bank. And bond investors told the Treasury Department earlier last month that they feared Hassett would push to lower borrowing costs aggressively to appease Trump, according tothe Financial Times, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter.
That sentiment was reflected in one-on-one conversations the department had with “executives at major Wall Street banks, asset management giants and other big players in the US debt market,” according to the report.
The unease comes at a time when policymakersare divided on how to proceed with interest rates. They fret that Hassett, a long-time Trump ally, would care more about following the president’s demands than preserving the Fed’s independence to set interest rates without political interference — even though the Fed chair has only one vote.
Their concerns matter because markets could throw a tantrum and force Trump to withdraw his nomination of Hassett, in an embarrassing U-turn.
“Markets really act as a sanity check for policy and other major decisions,” said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global investment strategist at Edward Jones.
Trump’s pick for Fed chair was already complicated because of Fed rules on who can serve as chair. Reshuffling his top economic advisers would add another layer of complexity. And Fed Governor Lisa Cook’s future on the Board is also uncertain asthe courts determine whether Trump can fire her.
“The market is already trying to figure out how dovish or hawkish the next Fed chair may be,” said Tom Porcelli, Wells Fargo’s chief economist. “But you don’t really know how someone will behave in a role once they’re actually sitting in that seat.”
As an independently funded agency, the Fed’s ability to make rate decisions free of politics is a major reason why investors believe in the US economy’s soundness. Politicians around the world often want to get cheap money flowing to help earn them votes. But that risks overheating economies and boosting inflation — long-term risks many politicians might ignore to focus on short-term elections.
If investors lose that faith in the Fed, they might demand a higher return to lend the country money through US Treasuries or other instruments. The irony is that those higher bond yields would likely push up long-term interest rates anyway.
But the structure of the Fed’s rate-setting committee could helpguard against political influence: The Fed chair is only one voter among 12 and cannot unilaterally veto what the majority decides.
“A range of views and policy approaches are represented around the table, and then everyone gets one vote,” said Bill English, a former adviser to the Fed’s Board of Governors.
“There’s a committee for a reason, and if the committee disagrees with the chair, then it’s possible that the chair loses a vote, which has never happened in the past,” he said.
The Fed chair isn’t the only economic position in play right now. There’s a whole web of Trump advisers who might be shuffling positions or even serving in simultaneously overlapping roles.
If Trump picks Hassett to lead America’s central bank, the president will have to find someone else to lead the NEC, which orchestrates White House economic policy.
Trump’s advisers have floated the possibility of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent leading the NEC while remaining as Treasury secretary,according to Bloomberg.Last week, Trump reiterated that he would gladly pick Bessent as Fed chair, though the Treasury secretary has repeatedly said he would rather keep his current role.
Trump also has to consider the Council of Economic Advisers. The chair of the CEA is Stephen Miran — who is now on temporary leave so he can serve out a term as a Fed governor in an unprecedented arrangement.Since arriving at the Fed in September, Miranhas advocated for large rate cuts, dissenting from the majority’s decision to lower rates by a quarter point at both the September and October meetings.
Miran’s term on the Fed expires at the end of January, butin response to questionsposed by senators during his confirmation process, Miran said that he won’t commit to resigning until a successor has been nominated and confirmed.
According to Fed rules, the chair can be chosen only from among Fed governors, and there is currently no vacancy on the Board. Powell’s leadership term ends in May, but he is serving a concurrent term as a governor that stretches to 2028. Powell hasn’t shared whether or not he plans to remain on the Board after his term as chair ends. Fed chairs typically step down altogether once theirfour-year term concludes, if they’re not re-appointed.
Trump could also swap Hassett for Miran, then elevate him to chair in May; or Trump could wait and hope that Powell announces he’s stepping down next year and have both Miran and Hassett at the Fed. In the latter scenario, Trump would then (theoretically) have to select replacements to lead the NEC and CEA.
Separately, Governor Lisa Cook’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s attempt to fire her over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud can also affect the make-up of the Fed’s powerful Board.
Trump in August said he fired Cook, the first time in the Fed’s century-plus history that a president has attempted to remove a sitting governor. Cook responded in the courts, andthe Supreme Court is scheduledto decide the case next year.
If Cook loses her case and is replaced, Trump would have effectively shaped the majority of the Board at a time when the central bank’s political independence is a flashpoint.
“There’s concern about a politicization of the Fed resulting in an undesirably high level of inflation over time,” English said. “The market could ultimately revolt if a new chair comes in and the committee, for whatever reason, goes along with lowering rates more than they need to be lowered.”"
"Hollywood, already on shaky economic ground, shudders at the prospect of a mega-Netflix",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/business/hollywood-netflix-warner-bros-deal,"Dec 5, 2025, 4:38 PM ET","The business of Hollywood was in trouble long before theearth-rattling newsthat Netflix had inked a $72 billion takeover of Warner Bros. And while the deal is widely seen as a coup by Netflix, once a scrappy startup that had to fight to be taken seriously, it also threatens to further shrink the industry and raise prices for consumers.
Producers, actors, writers and theater owners are not thrilled about the prospect of a mega-Netflix dominating show business, with major unions and trade groups expressing deep concern about the potential impact on jobs and communities.
“The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the Writers Guild of America, the union representing Hollywood writers,saidFriday. “The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers.”
Netflix triumphed over Paramount and Comcast late Thursday in a bidding war for Warner Bros., surprising many in the industry who saw Paramount as a shoo-in.
“Holy f—k. Netflix got WBD,” one Paramount staffer said in a text to CNN on Thursday night.
Netflix announces deal to buy Warner Bros. and HBO
David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN’s parent company, attributed the decision to “the realities of an industry undergoing generational change.”
The entertainment industry has experienced a series of upheavals in recent years. Studio consolidation accelerated in the late 2010s, leading to fewer projects being greenlit for production. The Covid-19 pandemic halted production for months, pushing studios to delay or cancel projects, leaving thousands out of work. Movie theaters faced an existential crisis during lockdowns, and have yet to reach pre-Covid audience levels. At the same time, TV and film productions have been increasingly moved out of the United States entirely to take advantage of lower labor costs and tax incentives.
All of that has rapidly shrunk the entertainment economy. Now, many worry the proposed Netflix deal will further erode their job security.
“Producers are rightfully concerned” about the potential deal, the Producers Guild of America said in a statement. “Our legacy studios are more than content libraries — within their vaults are the character and culture of our nation.”
SAG-AFTRA, Hollywood’s biggest actors union, also expressed concern about the potential deal, saying it raises “many serious questions” about the future of the entertainment industry, “especially the human creative talent whose livelihoods and careers depend on it.”
Theater owners, in particular, dread the idea of negotiating future film releases with the company that built its business partly on bypassing theaters to bring original content directly to viewers. The big screen would face “an unprecedented threat,” according to Cinema United, a trade association that represents more than 30,000 movie screens in the United States.
“Netflix’s stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition,” Cinema United President and CEO Michael O’Leary said in astatement. “In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.”
Netflix has been pushing back on that argument.
“We’ve released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it’s not like we have this opposition to movies in theaters,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a call with Wall Street analysts Friday. “My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long, exclusive windows, which we don’t really think are that consumer-friendly.”
He added: “Right now, you should count on everything that is planned on going to the theater through Warner Bros. will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros.”
Netflix only occasionally releases its films to theaters to meet the criteria for Oscar nominations. Its business model has always been based on maintaining a giant library of movies and TV shows that viewers can access anywhere, anytime.
By acquiring Warner Bros., Netflix would gain access to some of Hollywood’s most beloved and lucrative titles, including “Batman” and “Harry Potter,” as well as a deep, 100-year-old library of Hollywood classics like “Casablanca” and “The Wizard of Oz.” At the same time, it would control decades’ worth of network TV shows like “Friends” along with all of HBO’s prestige programming, such as “Game of Thrones.”
On top of all that, the deal would effectively allow Netflix, the streaming king, to wipe out its second-largest competitor after Disney: HBO Max.
“This is not a win for consumers,” Ross Benes, a senior analyst at eMarketer, told CNN. “Netflix has already aggressively raised prices, increased ad load, and stopped people from sharing passwords. Absorbing a competitor with strong content will only lead to its service becoming more expensive and give consumers less choice.”
It could also be bad news for the tens of thousands of workers employed by the film and TV industry. Benes said the deal would likely lead to layoffs and reduce the number of companies willing to spend heavily on TV and movies.
“This contracts the industry,” he said, while noting that the deal is far from done.
On Thursday,as news emergedthat Netflix was the top bidder for Warner Bros., an anonymous group of “concerned feature film producers” sent an open letter to Congress, warning of a potential economic and institutional “meltdown in Hollywood” if Netflix were to succeed, according toVariety.
The filmmakers argued that Netflix would “effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace.”
Paramount, on the other hand, took a different approach in its bid for Warner Bros., wooing talent with a theater-forward strategy.
Despite changes in the entertainment landscape, creative talent both in front of and behind the camera are eager for audiences to experience their work in theaters — not from the couch. It’s one of the reasons why Netflix’s top creators, the Duffer Brothers — best known for writing and producing the series “Stranger Things” — are jumping shipfrom Netflix to Paramount.
Paramount has also inked deals with some of the biggest names in movies over the past few months, including Tom Cruise, Will Smith, “Wicked” director John M. Chu and director James Mangold."

Trump’s tax and spending law is a short-term win but long-term headache for Wall Street,https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/17/investing/us-stock-market-trump-bill,,"President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending legislation is providing short-term clarity for Wall Street — but fueling concerns about the long-term health of the US economy, investors say.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which Trumpsigned into lawon July 4, is a positive for investors because of the certainty it provides for markets. But the bill is set toworsen the nation’s debt burdenover time, according to forecasts, which could put the government’s finances and the economy on shakier grounds.
For Wall Street, the legislation is not expected to spur growth or provide much of a boost to markets. Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, said the law is not stimulative like Trump’s first-term tax cuts, and coupled with tariffs, it’s not expected provide a meaningful tailwind for markets,

“There are very modest tax benefits that go into some areas, but the more important components are ultimately cutbacks in support for households that are already kind of struggling,” Green said. “This is a very regressive tax program.”
The package also includes some worries for investors because it does not address America’s accumulating debt load. The law’s passing has drawn ire from economists and deficit hawks who havewarned about the debt-to-economic growth ratioand the potential for a future debt crisis.
“Markets had already priced in much of the expected fiscal and economic impact,” investors at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a July 4 note. “However, the longer-term outlook is clouded by persistent deficits.”
Investors this year have been on a roller coaster ride as markets dropped amid trade uncertainty and have soared torecord highs. As Congress deliberated Trump’s bill, it was another source of uncertainty.
Signing the bill into law resolved that uncertainty, Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, said.
“We’ve still got tariff noise, but at least we don’t have to worry about something terrible happening with the tax bill,” Hatfield said. “It’s relief. It’s more like the absence of pain than it is pleasure.”
The tax cuts from Trump’s first term were set to expire at the end of the year, which would have resulted in a massive tax hike. Passing the bill, which extends those cuts, averts that scenario, Hatfield said.
The bill also raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, giving lawmakers relief about the impending “X date,” when the government was set to hit its borrowing limit.
For the stock market, however, there isn’t much juice in the legislation, Hatfield said.
“It’s probably slightly good for investors, but not significant,” he said. “We don’t view it as being stimulative to the economy.”
Trump during his campaign proposedlowering the corporate tax ratefrom 21% to 15%. That proposal did not make it into the final legislation, which held the corporate tax rate steady at 21%.
Investors at UBS said the bill’s passage provides a “modest fiscal boost for 2026,” noting other tax cuts and spending reforms “may support earnings growth at the margin.”
Wall Street analysts haveraised concernsthis year about global investors’ appetite for holding US debt. Those nerves were exacerbated by the size of Trump’s bill.
Long-term US debt, which is usually considered the safe, risk-free corner of the market, has come under scrutiny as the legislation is setto increase federal deficits.
Higher deficits mean the government would have to issue more debt to finance its spending. An increase in the supply of government bonds coupled with a rising debt load could mean the need to offer higher rates to attract investors. Higher rates correspond to higher borrowing costs for Americans.

“We’ve been highlighting the precarious position of the US government’s indebtedness for some time now, and, if left unchecked, we view debt as the single greatest risk to the ‘special status’ of the US in financial markets,” investors at BlackRock said in a June 30 note.
Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, said he doesn’t expect significant short-term effects on the bond market, but in the long run, he expects the debt accumulation will push interest rates higher.
“If the Fed’s independence is compromised with theappointment of a new chair, I think this will exacerbate the upward impact on longer-maturity Treasury yields,” Auerbach said.
Brian Rehling, head of global fixed income strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he thinks Republicans lawmakers are hoping that thebill will spur growth, helping offset the rising debt burden. “That remains to be seen,” he said.
Similar to Auerbach, Rehling said he doesn’t think there will be an immediate effect on the demand for bonds. But he expects yields to rise in the long run to compensate investors for the worsening fiscal outlook.
“I don’t think this is a moment in time where the bond vigilantes come out and you see kind of explosive moves to the upside in yields,” Rehling said.
“This is going to lead to the Treasury issuing more debt to cover these expenses,” he said. “And as supply comes onto the market, you would expect, just simple supply and demand, all else equal, that rates are going to have to increase to bring that demand into the market.”"
CNN exclusive: Colombian president says oil is ‘at the heart of’ US pressure campaign on Venezuela,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/26/americas/colombia-petro-venezuela-oil-us-latam-intl,"Nov 26, 2025, 12:01 AM ET","AsUS military activityramps up in the Caribbean and the Pacific, Colombia’s president alleged the Trump administration’s pressure campaign on Venezuela is more about accessing the South American country’s oil than fighting drug trafficking.
“(Oil) is at the heart of the matter,” Gustavo Petro told CNN in an exclusive interview, noting that Venezuela has what are considered the largest oil reserves in the world.
“So, that’s a negotiation about oil. I believe that is (US President Donald) Trump’s logic. He’s not thinking about the democratization of Venezuela, let alone the narco-trafficking,” he continued, adding that Venezuela is not considered a major drug producer and that only a relatively small portion of the global drugs trade flows through the country.
Petro has been at odds with Trump since he returned to the White House. In the past year, the Colombian leader has harshly criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies, its support for Israel and its military activity around Latin America.
On Tuesday, he accused the US of trying to impose its will on its neighbors, comparing its actions to imperialism. “The United States cannot be considered an empire, but one of the nations among others,” the president said.
In response to Petro’s comments, a US State Department spokesperson said the Trump administration remains “firm in its counter-drug operations in the Caribbean and its commitment to protecting Americans from the (Venezuelan President Nicolás) Maduro regime’s deadly poison.”
CNN has also reached out to the White House for comment.
Asked if he had a message to the American people, Petro replied, “My message is the one they give to all members of the United States special forces: Your function, as they say in the oaths, is to fight against oppression. I repeated that on the streets in the United States, and it also cost me,” Petro said.
He appeared to be referring to the US State Departmentrevoking his visaat the conclusion of the UN General Assembly in September after he publicly called on American soldiers to disobey Trump and “not to point their rifles at humanity.”
It’s one of the many actions the Trump administration has taken against the Colombian leader in recent months.
Colombians caught in fallout of Trump-Petro feud
In October, the US Treasurysanctioned Petro, accusing him of playing a “role in the global illicit drug trade,” a claim the Colombian leader has rejected.
The sanctions were imposed days after Trump said he wouldhalt all US payments and subsidiesto Colombia, claiming Petro “does nothing to stop” the production of drugs in his country.
Petro defended his efforts to fight the drug trade, telling CNN that his government had seized more cocaine than any other in history. “So much so that in recent years, I have managed to ensure that the growth in crops, which is stagnating, is far surpassed by the growth in seizures,” he said.
Asked why Trump hadn’t acknowledged this, Petro said: “Because of pride. Because he thinks I’m a subversive thug, a terrorist, and things like that, simply because I was a member of the M-19,” a Colombian guerrilla movement active in the 1970s and 1980s.
Petro also told CNN that he believes the US is comparing him to Maduro.
His comments come a day after the US designated theCartel de los Soles, an alleged drug trafficking group that the US has claimed Maduro leads, as a foreign terrorist organization. Venezuela has denied the claims, and experts say the phrase is more a description of allegedly corrupt government officials than an organized crime group.
While Maduro has a problem with democracy, Petro said he is not that convinced about the Venezuelan president’s drug trafficking links.
“The problem of Maduro is called democracy … the lack of democracy,” Petro told CNN, adding that “no Colombian investigation … has shown us a relationship between Colombian drug trafficking and Maduro.”
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Venezuela isnot a cocaine-producing country. Of the 3,700 tons of coca produced worldwide, more than 2,500 tons come from Colombia, while Venezuela does not appear on production maps, according to the UNODC, which said: “The majority of Colombian cocaine is being trafficked north along the Pacific coast.”
Investigators from the US Drug Enforcement Agency reached similar conclusions, writing in their annual report published in March that 84% of the cocaine seized in the US comes from Colombia.
Over the weekend, Colombian news programNoticias Caracolreported alleged links between Colombian officials and dissidents of the now-defunct rebel group FARC. According to the report, senior military and intelligence officials shared sensitive intelligence with the armed groups and advised them about how to secretly acquire weapons and evade military scrutiny.
Petro has denied the allegations but acknowledged to CNN on Tuesday that ties between officials and drug traffickers have existed for years, even before he took office.
A spokesperson for the US State Department said it is aware of the recent reports and urged Petro and other Colombian institutions to “thoroughly investigate these allegations and take all appropriate actions.”
Colombia has long been Washington’s most reliable ally in South America on security and defense. In 2022, the Biden administration designated the Andean country as a “major non-NATO ally.”
Despite recent tensions at the top, US-Colombia relations remain intact.
US Secretary of StateMarco Rubiohas made clear publicly that the administration’s issues are with Petro, not the institutions in Colombia.
“Our relationships with the people of Colombia, the economic sector of Colombia, the majority of people in politics in Colombia, and their institutions, in particular their defense institutions, are strong and enduring, and they’re going to be strong and enduring long after this individual is no longer the president there,” Rubio previously said.

When it makes sense to help your adult kids financially — and when it doesn’t,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/30/business/making-financial-gifts-to-adult-children-grandchildren,"Nov 30, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Spending the holidays with your adult children and the grandkids?
If so, their futures may be on your mind, especially if you sense – or they just flat-out say – they’re not flush enough to buy a home, put their own kids through school, or pay off big debts they’ve acquired.
As a parent, you may wonder if you should help them or if it makes more sense to stay out of it and leave them money after you die, if that’s an option.
To figure out what is right for you, here are four questions to consider:
Think carefully about how much you can comfortably offer.
“It’s understandable to want to support your children. (But) balance that emotion with whether you can afford it,” said Rob Williams, head of Financial Planning and Wealth Management Research at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
Consider your cash inflow and your spend rate along with how much of a cushion you’ll need to handle unexpected medical expenses or long-term care, said Dawn Jinsky, a certified financial planner and a partner at Plante Moran.
If money is tight, Jinsky noted, it’s okay to say, “We really want to but can’t right now.”
Or maybe you feel you can afford to give money now, just not on a regular basis. So set expectations. “Frame it as a one-time gift,” Jinsky said.
Your children’s financial circumstances won’t be identical and you may be considering helping the one who currently has the greatest need.
But if your goal is to be fair to your other kids, too, you can do that in ways that don’t require you to part with more money now.
Say you have three kids and plan to give one $50,000 today. You might amend your estate documents to make sure the other two children each get $50,000 more after you’re gone, Jinsky suggested.
But you might want to explain that to all three kids. “Communication is key when it comes to family dynamics,” she said.
Assuming you will have what you need to live comfortably, there are three potentially good reasons to give your offspring money while you’re alive.
First, they may benefit more from financial help in their earlier adult years than, say, in their 60s, assuming you die decades from now. “Your dollars may have more of an impact when given during your lifetime rather than upon your passing,” Jinsky said.
Second, it gives you an opportunity to support them in ways that are meaningful to you.
“Anchor a gift in your values. Your money speaks for you. Make sure it says what you mean,” said Williams. When his own father became ill, he wanted to give money to his grandchildren and wanted it used for education, so he set up 529 plans for them. But he also wrote each child a personal note, expressing how proud he was of them and how important education had been in his life. “It was the happiest I’ve seen him. He died three months later,” Williams said.
Third, if your estate is large and likely subject to tax after death in your state, if not at the federal level (where individuals canexemptup to $13.99 million this year and $15 million next year) giving gifts can reduce your taxable estate.
If you have an adult child who regularly overspends, mismanages loans or has anaddiction, think hard before helping.
You might﻿not want to bail them out if doing so would just reinforce their bad habits. “In an ideal world, you’re supporting assets and not repairing liabilities,” Williams said. “Generosity ideally doesn’t create dependency.”
But you might want to help if part of your child’s predicament isn’t necessarily their fault – for instance, they’re saddled with unexpectedmedical debtor have a disability.
If you do decide to help but worry the money won’t be handled well, you can pay a given expense directly.
“Look for as many avenues that you can to benefit the child but not put financial means into their hands,” Jinsky said.
Make an annual gift:In any given year you may give up to a certain amount – it’s $19,000 this year and next – to as many individuals as you choose. That amount doubles to $38,000 if you’re making the gift with your spouse.
The money is tax-free to the recipient. And so long as the amount you give to any one person doesn’t exceed the $19,000 cap, it won’t count against your federal lifetimegift tax exemption– which is as high as the estate tax exemption.
If your gift does exceed the cap, but you’re nowhere near maxing out your lifetime exemption amount, you won’t owe tax on the excess but you will have to file agift tax return.
Note that once you give the money you cannot control how it will be used.  “The most difficult part for parents in gifting that amount is a little bit of ‘Let go and let God,’” Jinsky said.
Pay expenses directly:The bill you pay for your child’s or grandchild’s medical or educational expenses does not count as a gift. “Parents can make payments of any amounts directly to the institution if it is for education or medical expenses,” Jinsky said.
But any other money you use to pay their expenses – eg, your child’s mortgage or credit card debt – will count as a gift and issubject to the now-$19,000 annual exclusion.
Establish a trust:Atrustis a more complicated way to gift money, Jinsky noted. But it can be designed to pay out in ways best tailored to your adult child’s or grandchild’s circumstance and to protect the assets in it from being drained. For instance, if the adult child is in a bad marriage, has creditors chasing them or has special needs.
“Typically, the purpose of the trust is for the parent to name a trustee to retain control over the assets to protect and preserve them,” she said. “In many instances a parent will choose to never have the trust distribute outright but instead remain intact for the child’s entire lifetime.”"
"Orbán meets Putin in Moscow to shore up Hungary’s energy supplies, making use of Trump exemption",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/28/energy/orban-putin-moscow-hungary-energy-oil-intl,"Nov 28, 2025, 9:00 AM ET","Hungarian Prime MinisterViktor Orbánmet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow Friday to shore up Hungary’s energy supplies and discuss efforts to end the war in Ukraine.
Having spurned chances to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels, Hungary was facing aviolent economic shockafter the Trump administration last month imposedsanctionson Russia’s two biggest oil producers. Before the sanctions were announced, Orbán had warned that, without energy imports from Russia, Hungary’s economy would be brought “to its knees.”
But Orbán, a hard-right populist and a darling of the MAGA movement, was spared that shock after US President Donald Trump granted Hungary aone-year exemptionfrom the sanctions, sayingit had been “difficult” for his ally to wean the country off Russian oil since it is landlocked.
“We recently travelled to Washington to secure Hungary’s exemption from the American sanctions on Russian energy: we succeeded. Now we must take the next step, guaranteeing that deliveries to Hungary continue without interruption,” Orbán wrote on social media Friday.
“This is why I am going to Russia today: to make sure Hungary’s energy supply remains secure and affordable this winter and in the year ahead,” he added.
Although Trump, explaining why he was considering granting Hungary an exemption, said it had been “very difficult for him (Orbán) to get the oil and gas from other areas” since “they don’t have ports,” analysts have disputed this reasoning.
After Moscow’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, European Union countries moved to slash Russian energy imports in a bid to deplete the Kremlin’s war chest. However, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – three Central European nations – were given an exemption from a ban on importingRussian crude oil, giving them time to reduce their reliance on Moscow.
While the Czech Republic has since phased out Russian crude oil, Hungary and Slovakia used the exemption to deepen their dependence. Russian crude oil made up 86% of all Hungarian purchases of crude in 2024, up from 61% pre-invasion. So far this year, 92% of Hungary’s crude oil imports have been from Russia.
Slovakia, meanwhile, is “almost 100% dependent” on supply from Moscow, according to areportin May from the Center for the Study of Democracy and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.
Isaac Levi, an analyst at CREA, told CNN earlier this month that the latest US exemption is a “terrible and unnecessary mistake that will allow over €1 billion ($1.2 billion) to flow into the Kremlin’s war chest.”
He said the Trump administration’s rationale for the exemption was not credible, since the Czech Republic, another landlocked country, no longer imports Russian crude oil and has lower fuel prices at the pump than Hungary. “This clearly shows that the oil flows that continue to finance Putin’s war in Ukraine are entirely unnecessary,” Levi said.
During Friday’s meeting in Moscow, Orbán and Putin also discussed recent US-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Putin did not rule out Friday the possibility of a summit in Budapest with Trump, Russian state media reported.
Putin and Trump had agreed in October to meet in the Hungarian capital to discuss ending the conflict, but those plans were swiftly shelved, with Trump saying he did not want the talks to be a waste of time."
Wall Street is relying on the Supreme Court to protect the Fed. Is that wishful thinking?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/29/business/wall-street-fed-supreme-court,"Nov 29, 2025, 3:00 AM ET","Wall Street barely blinked at President Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve this year. But its confidence could be shaken with an upcoming Supreme Court ruling.
Trump has launched an intense pressure campaign against the Fed during his second term, frequently demanding interest-rate cuts and threatening to fire Chair Jerome Powell. The central bank has lowered interest rates twice this year, in September and October, and has another opportunity to cut rates in December.
Yet investors remain confident in the Fed’s ability to fight inflation — at least according to measures such as long-term interest rates on US Treasuries and inflation expectations.
Their faith hinges on a Supreme Court case overTrump’s efforts to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor.
If Trump wins, the Fed’s vaunted independence to set interest rates without political interference could crumble.
But Wall Street seems to believe the Supreme Court will ultimately opt to keep the central bank independent. Markets also seem to believe that none of the names floated to succeed Powell as Fed chair when his term ends in May pose a threat in that regard, either.
“For now, Wall Street is very comfortable with Fed independence,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at financial services firm DA Davidson.
Just three days after Trump said he fired Cook in August — the first time a president has tried to fire a Fed governor in the central bank’s near-112-year history — the S&P 500 closed at a record high as other major stock indexes pushed higher.
Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, a benchmark used for the rates on various loans, has steadily declined since the spring, when Trump began to threaten firing Powell. That means investors don’t see interest rates getting out of control in the next decade, a sign of confidence in the Fed.
Indeed, long-term market-based inflation expectations, which capture Wall Street’s faith in the Fed’s ability to fight price increases, have remained in check throughout the year.
But fears of growing government deficits have driven up so-called term premiums, the extra yield investors demand for holding long-term bonds over shorter ones. Investors say concerns about Fed independence have also played a role — albeit a minor one — in the uptick.
The court has scheduled oral arguments in late January to determine whether Trump has the power to fire Cook. The president has cited unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The Justice Department is investigating, but she has not been charged. Earlier this month, Cook’s lawyers said the allegations are “baseless” andurged the department to drop its inquiry.
In a separate case in May, the justices said in an unsigned opinion that Trumpcould keep Gwynne Wilcox, whom he fired from the National Labor Relations Board, off the NLRB while she continues fighting in court to reverse her termination.
But SCOTUS specifically said thatdecision doesn’t impact the Fed.
“Markets took a great deal of comfort from that,” Randall Kroszner, a former Fed governor, said at a central banking conference on October 31 hosted by the Peterson Institute for Economics (PIIE). He said investors “believe that the Supreme Court will take a reasonable and balanced approach” in the Cook case.
Investors are also closely watching Trump’s nomination of the next Fed chair. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led the search, revealeda shortlist of five peoplefrom the White House, the Fed and the private sector. The list includes National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett as well as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.
Bessent told CNBC recently that Trump’s announcement could come around Christmas.
“Markets still seem to be fairly confident Fed independence will prevail, and I think this is in part because of the names that we saw for Fed chairman were reasonable,” Francesco Bianchi, an economics professor and monetary policy scholar at Johns Hopkins University, said at the PIIE conference."
$1.9 billion pledged in fight against polio. But huge gap remains after cuts from donor countries.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/08/middleeast/polio-funding-gap-gates-foundation-intl,"Dec 8, 2025, 11:14 AM ET","International leaders and philanthropists, including Bill Gates, announced $1.9 billion Monday in funding to advancepolioeradication, but a large funding gap remains after high-income countries’ reductions in foreign aid.
The funding gap for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative through 2029 now stands at $440 million, according to a statement on the initiative about the pledging event held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
The private-public partnership aims to eradicate polio worldwide by 2029 and is led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gates Foundation, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and Gavi, the vaccine alliance. In October, the initiative announced it would experience a30% budget reductionnext year amid sharpdeclines in official development assistancefrom high-income countries.
“The gap that remains is largely due to tighter aid environments among traditional donors,” a spokesperson for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, Ally Rogers, told CNN. “Without the full $6.9 billion needed to fully implement the GPEI’s strategy, and sustained political commitment to a polio-free world, children will be left unprotected against polio, and the eradication effort could be hindered.”
Donor countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany have also reduced funding for 2026, according to the initiative spokesperson and analysts. Meanwhile, the Trump administrationhalted funding for Gaviandpulled out of the WHOearlier this year. Funding to fight polio has continued to receive bipartisan support from Congress, and the fiscal year 2025 funding was level, but the budget for 2026 is not yet clear.
The $1.9 billion in donations will advance efforts to vaccinate 370 million children against polio each year and bolster local health systems that also protect kids from other preventable diseases.
“We are on the cusp of eradicating polio and securing a historic win for humanity. But we need all countries, partners and donors to step up now to get the job done,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in astatementon Monday.
Initiative donors include the Mohamed bin Zayed Foundation for Humanity, Rotary International and Bloomberg Philanthropies, as well as the governments of Pakistan, Germany, the US, Japan and Luxembourg. The largest pledge of $1.2 billion was made by the Gates Foundation.
Poliovirus can cause infection in the central nervous system, which may lead to paralysis and death if breathing muscles become immobilized. The virus can spread rapidly in areas with poor sanitation. It used to paralyze more than 350,000 children around the world each year before global immunization efforts were launched, according to the WHO.
Now, wild poliovirus is onlyendemic, or consistently present, in two countries – Afghanistan and Pakistan. However, outbreaks of variant poliovirus continue to threaten 18 other countries, according to the statement from the Abu Dhabi summit.
Since the initiative was created in 1988, it estimates that billions of children have beenprotected through vaccinationand polio cases have reduced by more than 99%.

We’re 99.9 percent of the way there – but the last stretch demands the same determination that got us this far,” said Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation and co-founder of Microsoft, in a statement. “This renewed funding will help us cross the finish line and strengthen the systems that protect children from this terrible disease for good.”
Global health officials are aiming to replicate the success of eradicatingsmallpox, which in 1980 became the first disease to be eliminated through human efforts. But several self-imposed deadlines for polio eradication have beenmissedstarting with 2000, as the campaign has been plagued by funding gaps, the emergence of new polio variants,misinformation and mismanagement.

"Trump administration changes have left US diplomats demoralized and less able to do their jobs, report says",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/politics/state-department-low-morale,"Dec 3, 2025, 11:17 AM ET","Changes by the Trump administration have left US diplomats demoralized and less able to do their jobs, according to a scathing new report by the union representing foreign service officers.
The report, based on a survey of foreign service members, found that a vast majority of respondents — 98% — said morale had declined since January, and a third were considering leaving the foreign service early.
Twenty-five percent of the foreign service has “resigned, retired, seen their agencies dismantled, or been removed from their posts” since January, the report said, and more are considering leaving.
The findings of the report from the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) underscore concerns voiced for months by career diplomats and foreign policy experts about the negative impact of the Trump administration’ssweeping changesto the State Department and foreign assistance programs.
Scores of diplomats have lost their jobs due to the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID). More than 240 foreign service officers were given termination notices in July, to take effect later in the year, as part of the State Department’sdrastic reorganization. The report is being released as the department moves forward with those terminations, which AFSA has said is in violation of the law.
“The U.S. Foreign Service is being systematically undermined by its own leadership,” AFSA President John Dinkelman warned in the report, which is set to be released on Wednesday afternoon. “The Foreign Service—the very institution tasked with navigating our global interests—is being dismantled in real time.”
Rubio hails end of USAID as study says its elimination could contribute to 14 million deaths in next 5 years
More than 2,100 AFSA members responded to the survey, which was conducted between August and September of this year.
Eighty-six percent said policy changes made by the Trump administration “have negatively affected their ability to implement the foreign policy of the United States,” according to the forthcoming report, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. Just 1% of respondents reported any improvement, the report said.
Many survey respondents reported diplomatic work is now more difficult because of cuts in budgets and staff and “diminished credibility.”
Most said that “key projects and initiatives are being delayed or suspended” and that they “are managing significantly heavier workloads due to staffing losses.” Forty-six percent “report new obstacles in negotiating with foreign counterparts” due to the changes implemented by the administration.
Asked to respond to the report, a senior State Department official said there were 5,751 applicants to take the foreign service officer test this year, a significant increase over past years.
The official said career diplomats were “integral in informing and implementing policy” on things like the “response to Hurricane Melissa, our efforts to secure peace between Cambodia and Thailand, and our work in Iraq, Haiti, and in South America.”
Foreign policy experts and former diplomats had warned that the changes put in place by the Trump administration, including the suddensuspensionand cancellation of US foreign assistance, would threaten the country’s credibility abroad.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke highly of State Department staff when he arrived in the role, calling them “the greatest, the most effective, the most talented, the most experienced diplomatic corps in the history of the world.”
In remarks on his first day as secretary, he said he wanted the State Department to be “at the core of how we formulate foreign policy, because we’re going to have the best ideas of any agency, and because we’re going to execute it better and faster and more effectively than any other agency in our government.”
However, in the months since, many have felt the expertise of the career foreign service has been largely overlooked as President Donald Trump has mainly turned toa small team of business associates and personal alliesto conduct foreign policy.
State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Rubio “values candid insights from patriotic Americans who have chosen to serve their country.”
He said that the use of special envoys is not new, and “those complaining are either unable or unwilling to find a way to be productive or contribute.”
Many diplomats who spoke to CNN have expressed fears of reprisal. Morale has plummeted in the wake of the State Department’s reorganization, during which 246 foreign service officers and more than 1,000 civil service officers were given reduction-in-force notices.
Pigott said the administration’s reorganization of the State Department was meant “to ensure those on the front lines – the regional bureaus and the embassies – are in a position to impact policies.”
Foreign service officers who were given the notices were to be placed on administrative leave for 120 days before formally losing their jobs. But on the day that those terminations were supposed to be finalized, affected diplomats were told the State Department was extending administrative leave. This week, they received emails saying firings would be finalized on December 5.
AFSAsaidthat this is illegal under the continuing resolution to fund the government, which says that “no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force to reduce the number of employees within any department, agency, or office of the federal government” while it is in effect.
A State Department spokesperson said the language in the continuing resolution doesn’t apply to these terminations “since the State Department’s lawful reduction in force (RIF) process was commenced and initiated well before the lapse in appropriations.”
“Legal opinions published by both OMB and DOJ confirm that outcome. The State Department will proceed with executing the RIF process as planned,” the spokesperson said. AFSA has said it will be pursuing legal action.

The cracks in Trump’s base,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/06/politics/donald-trump-republicans-base-divide,"Dec 6, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","No politician in modern history has held as much sway over his base asPresident Donald Trump. And perhaps nothing has mattered more to his political career than that.
Whenever Trump’s been down – such as after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot or after he was indicted four times – he’s been able to count on his base to keep him relevant and in the game. Republicans’ fear of crossing Trump is perhaps the animating principle in the party, and it’s allowed him to plow through any number of controversies that would have sunk pretty much any other politician.
But more than ever, that’s starting to change. We’ve seen cracks in Trump’s base for a while. And they’re starting to widen.
It’s not just Rep.Marjorie Taylor Greeneof Georgia who seems to be balking at at least some of what she’s seeing.
In fact, a number of recent polls have shown 1 in 5 Republicans or more disapproving of Trump on a range of issues. Sometimes, those numbers stretch much higher, and even around majority territory.
It hasn’t pulled down his overall approval rating among Republicans much, but it suggests that the base isn’t so unflinchingly in his corner anymore.
Here are the key issues.
It’s difficult to find an issue on which Republicans have been less pleased with Trump. Few polls have shown even half of them approving. But generally speaking, they’ve chosen the neutral option.
A recentReuters-Ipsos poll, for example, showed31%of Republicans disapproved of Trump on the issue, compared to 44% who approved and 25% who chose neither option.
But when you get more people to choose, things look considerably worse. A recentMarquette University Law School pollactually showed a majority of Republicans –54%– disapproved of Trump’s handling of “information about Jeffrey Epstein.”
This is probably Trump’s most significant problem, because of how much people care about it.
His disapproval rating among Republicans in recent polls has generally been pegged around 1 in 4. It was at24%in aYahoo News-YouGov poll,25%in aCBS News-YouGov polland26%in the Reuters-Ipsos poll.
But that number spiked to﻿39%in the Marquette poll.
And there’s reason to believe these numbers might actually undersell Trump’s problem with the base here. After all, recent CBS polling showed a majority of Republicans –57%– say the administration hasn’t focused enough on lowering the cost of goods and services. That’s certainly a form of disapproval.
Also tellingly: Trump’s disapproval rating among Republicans on the broader issue of the economy has also climbed. It was as high as22%in aFox News polland32%in anAP-NORC poll.
This hasn’t gotten much attention. But it’s amazing that Democrats haven’t made more an issue of it.
GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky recently wagered that Trump spending tens of billions of dollars to bail out Argentina’s government could be a “deal-breaker” with the MAGA base. After all, it’s about the polar opposite of “America First.”
And he seems to have a point.
The Marquette poll found that a whopping69%of Republicans disapproved of Trump “providing $20-$40 billion to help stabilize Argentina’s economy.”
It’s one poll, and it’d be good to get more data. But the idea that 7 in 10 Republicans could disapprove of Trump on anything in any poll would once have been unthinkable.
Trump’s problems here are many.
For one, he promised to end the war on Day One and has decidedly failed to live up to that. For another, he’s generally catered to Russia in a way that makes hawkish Republicans uncomfortable – including with his recent ceasefire plan thatlooked as if it were written by Moscow.
His disapproval rating among Republicans on this issue has ranged from23%in a recentGallup pollall the way up to40%in the Marquette poll.
Trump’s focus on foreign matters in general seems to be a problem with some Republicans who prefer he’d turn his focus to his own country. For instance, the same Gallup poll showed22%﻿disapproved of Trump’s handling of the situation in the Middle East – this despite the recent ceasefire deal in Gaza.
This one might be surprising to some people. But it’s looking like Democrats’ efforts to focus the government shutdown debate on Obamacare subsidies has paid off.
Trump is seeingsome of his worst numbersto date on health care – about as bad as when the GOP tried to pass a very unpopular Obamacare repeal bill in 2017.
His disapproval rating among Republicans on health care has registered at19%(Reuters),21%(Gallup),26%(Fox News), and all the way up to32%in the AP-NORC poll.
This has been a sleeping giant of an issue for Trump.Pew Research Center pollingshowed the percentage of Republicans who said Trump was making the federal government work better dropped from76%in February to55%in August.
And the government shutdown doesn’t appear to have helped.
The AP-NORC poll conducted in early November showed32%of Republicans disapproved of how Trump was handling the federal government. The Marquette poll showed nearly half –48%– disapproved of Trump’s handling of the shutdown.
All of these are cracks in the base. Whether they ultimately cause Republicans to flee is another question. But it’s clear we’re seeing cracks in a way we rarely have before."

The Trump administration has voiced optimism and urged patience as Americans continue to facepersistently high prices— from groceries to housing. But a growing number of Republicans worry the economy coulddrag the party downin the midterm elections. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sought to ease those concerns on Sunday, telling CBS News that the US will shift toward “prosperity” next year and move past today’s “affordability problem.” A recent Gallup poll found that 40% of Americans rated economic conditions as poor in November, up from 37% in October.
The Supreme Court today will grapple with President Donald Trump’s power tofire the heads of independent agencies. The court will hear arguments in a case stemming from Trump’s decision in March to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from the Federal Trade Commission, despite a federal law that attempts to insulate the agency from political pressure by permitting its members to be removed only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Trump has provided no such justification. The court’s ruling is all but certain to influence other cases, raising similarly weighty separation of powers questions.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with European leaders in London today after days of fraught peace talks with Trump administration officials. Ukrainian negotiators spent the weekend in Miami trying to finalize aUS-backed plan to end Russia’s war, but left without a breakthrough. The Ukrainian Ambassador to the US said “difficult issues remain … but both sides continue working to shape realistic and acceptable solutions.” As Russia vows toseize more land, Kyiv is demanding firm security guarantees to avoid giving up additional territory.
Thailand launched airstrikes against Cambodia today, marking the potentialcollapse of a peace planbrokered by President Trump just two months ago. The two Southeast Asian neighbors both accused each other of launching strikes along their disputed border after weeks of simmering tension. In July, the countries fought afive-day border conflictthat killed dozens of people and displaced about 200,000 on both sides of the frontier. An initial ceasefire between the two sides was agreed on July 28 after Trump spoke with their respective leaders.
President Trump recognized several household names from the music and film industry on Sunday at the48th annual Kennedy Center Honors. Trump announced the recipients in August and said he would host the show amid his ongoing overhaul of the Kennedy Center — the country’s most prominent cultural institution. This year’s inductees include actor Sylvester Stallone and the band KISS,among others. In February, Trump dismissed a slew of Democratic appointees from the center’s board of trustees and replaced them with aides and allies. He has also said he was “98% involved” in selecting the latest honorees, personally rejecting some deemed too “woke.”

Every election is a change election now,https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/07/politics/elections-republicans-democrats-trump-obama-vis,"Sep 7, 2025, 10:00 AM ET","A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.
The pendulum of power is swinging more and more frequently in the United States.
In the 100 years between 1900 and 2000, control of the House, Senate or White House changed hands in Washington with relative infrequency and never in more than two elections in a row.
In the 25 years since 2000, the party controlling the White House and/or at least one chamber of Congress changed in all but two US elections.
It is an unprecedented period of political turnover in which voters have pulled the lever for some kind of change – either picking a president from a new party or flipping the majority in the House or Senate – nearly every time they’re given the chance in recent years.
At least one lever of power has flipped between Republicans and Democrats in Washington in each of the last six elections, the most consecutive power changes going back to before the Civil War.
In five of the last seven presidential elections, voters opted for a president from the other party. In the same time period, voters elected a new Senate majority five times and picked a new House majority four times.
The only elections this century in which the House, Senate and White House all remained under control of the same party were the only two successful presidential reelection campaigns, for George W. Bush in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2012. Those are also the only times the same party held on to the White House this century.
Today’s politicians have come to expect frequent shifts in power.
The last four presidents have all assumed office with unified control of Washington and worked as quickly as possible to exploit it. Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Trump again in his second term all utilized reconciliation to get around the roadblock of the filibuster in the Senate and pass some sort of sweeping agenda item without help from the other party.
For Obama, it was the Affordable Care Act. For Trump, it was tax cuts in his first term; in his second, it was a sweeping tax cut and agenda bill that pared back social safety net spending. For Biden, it was the Inflation Reduction Act, which had a lot more to do with clean energy and climate change than it did with reducing inflation.
We’ll see if Trump breaks this mold — something he isdesperatelytryingto doby redrawing congressional maps in search of more Republican seats. But each of those other three administrations immediately lost the House.
President George W. Bush defied political gravity and picked up House seats after his first two years in office, but that had a lot to do with his popularity after the 9/11 terror attacks.
Bush lost the House four years later, after his reelection, when the public had turned on the wars.
Bill Clinton lost the House in his first midterm, the 1994 Republican revolution. It was the first time Republicans had gained control of the House since the 1950s. They’ve lost and regained the House twice in the years since.
Clinton picked up seats in the 1998 midterm, when the country turned against Republican efforts to impeach him.
Sarah Binder, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said these elections change the balance of power, but a better way to view them is as “nationalized elections.”
Voters are less frequently splitting their tickets between a senator or representative from one party and a president from the other as they tend more often to stick with one national party.
“We’ve had nationalized elections, but we didn’t have them back to back to back all the time,” Binder said.
The closes corollary to today is probably the late 19th century, Binder said.
“It was similarly a period of high partisanship and ideological disagreement,” she explained, but today there is the added element of much slimmer majorities — even in presidential elections. Trump, Bush and Clinton all won the White House without winning a majority of the popular vote in their first term.
Not all power changes are equal, but they all affect how things work in the US government.
If Democrats can wrest control of the House from Republicans next year – which is more likely than the chance they could flip the Senate – it will allow them to stand in the way of Trump’s legislative agenda, investigate his administration and gain more power in spending debates.
The general indicator for how a president’s party will do in a midterm election is the president’s own approval rating. Trump’s, as it has been, is underwater.
Only twice in midterm elections going back to 1938 – for W. Bush in 2002 and Clinton in 1998 – has the president’s party not lost seats in a midterm. In both cases, the president had approval ratings over 60%. Today, Trump’s is under 50%.
This year, Republicans are trying to change the map to draw more Republican seats. They’ve already changed the map in Texas to create five new seats to win, although it’s a strategy that might not pay off if groups like Hispanic voters don’t vote with the party in the same way they did in 2024.
Republicans are also looking to redraw maps in Missouri and Ohio. Democrats are stymied by laws and state constitutional obstructions to such shenanigans in many states they control, but they are trying to find seatsin California.
Democrats of the 1970s and 1980s routinely had 80-plus-seat majorities. In the most recent elections, House majorities were determined by a handful of the 435 voting members.
So while the power changes are happening more frequently, they’re not accompanied by large swings in the size of majorities. Trump’s Republicans lost 40 seats after the 2018 midterm and ceded control of the House. Biden’s Democrats lost just 9 seats after the 2022 midterm, but they also ceded control of the House.
The margins in the House are tight enough that in a close midterm, Republicans’ redistricting efforts could pay off and allow them to maintain control of the House. But if there’s a riptide against President Donald Trump and his policies, no amount of gerrymandering is likely to save Republicans’ House majority.

"There’s still one beautiful Southern European country with delicious food, great wine and no tourist crowds",https://www.cnn.com/travel/north-macedonia-tourism-skopje-travel,"Dec 3, 2025, 8:05 AM ET","Spiked with ridges and peaks that deliver scenery running the full four-seasons gamut — from electric green slopes to snow-capped crags — North Macedonia offers one of Southern Europe’s final chances to take the path less-traveled.
Previouslyknown as Macedoniaafter declaring its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, North Macedonia is an underexplored pocket of the Balkans whose layered history, from the Byzantine and the Ottoman to the Yugoslav eras, has combined with its omnipresent mountains to produce a set of regional cultures with a staunch commitment to tradition, and a warm, bottom-of-the-heart hospitality.
Located directly north of Greece, this landlocked nation is one of the world’s most mountainous countries, and the dramatic terrain is central to its identity.
“When I enter my car, whichever direction I want to drive, I have a mountain in front of me and a mountain behind me,” said Frosina Pandurska-Dramikjanin, who lives in the nation’s capital, Skopje, and works with rural development and community empowerment. “I think this is the best way to describe my country.”
The country of 2 million people, that’s slightly larger than Vermont, has yet to experience the throngs of tourists that choke much of Southern Europe every summer. Those involved in the travel industry are wary of courting that kind of mass tourism, which could adversely affect the quality of life for residents. But they know that the country has much to offer and the tourism sector still has room to grow.
Aleksandar Bogoevski, owner of Sustainable Adventure Travels, a travel agency that reinvests a share of its profits in the infrastructure of the communities it partners with, says that many tourists drive through the country every year on their way to nearby hotspots like Greece or Albania. He wants them to know that Macedonia is a destination all by itself.
“Approximately one million passengers are transiting Macedonia during the summertime. They don’t stop,” said Bogoevski. “I think there is so many other things that can be seen.”
Much of what can be seen in North Macedonia lies along the sides of the small, winding roads that carve their way through the countryside along valley floors.
These routes are studded with immaculately preserved Byzantine monasteries, some more than 1,000 years old, replete with ornate woodworking inlaid with mother of pearl, gold-plated chandeliers and ancient frescoes. Among the best known is Bigorski Monastery, where an affordable guest house welcomes weary trekkers from nearby Mavrovo National Park. There, the brilliant ruby and topaz treetops on a meandering October drive can put any New England postcard to shame.
Sveti Naum, which has stood at the edge of Lake Ohrid since the year 905, is another well-known — and well worth visiting — monastery. Lake Ohrid, whose glittering waters are located south of Mavrovo on the Albanian border, is North Macedonia’s crown jewel.
A UNESCO World Heritage site ringed by mountains, the Lake Ohrid area pulls in visitors from across the Balkans every summer. Some come for ecotourism. The spring-fed lake boasts around 1,200 species of plants and animals. Others come for a more traditional tourist experience: shopping for freshwater pearls along the bazaar street in the historic town of Ohrid on the lake’s northeastern shore, or sipping on spritz cocktails at beach bars tucked along the shoreline. Another stunning national park, Galicica, hugs the eastern shore with spectacular Lake Prespa just southeast of that park.
More than a hundred miles north in the Šar Mountain range, on the country’s northwestern border with Kosovo, eager hikers and mountaineers can find an abundance of challenging routes. Some villagers in the mountains still practice an ancient shepherding practice known as transhumance by leading their sheep on seasonal migrations down to the villages in winter and up to the mountaintops in the summer.
Pandurska-Dramikjanin is grateful that the increasingly rare practice still exists in her country and thinks conscientious tourism could help sustain it. But she’s cautious about the overcommodification of a traditional way of life.
“In other countries, I have seen very, very bad examples of how mass tourism killed the local culture,” Pandurska-Dramikjanin said. “We want to keep tourists that will really appreciate our nature and our culture.”
Ana Labor manages Spirit of Prespa, an agritourism business on her family’s apple orchard north of Lake Prespa, which sits on just five hectares,or about 12 acres. Small family farms are the norm in Macedonia, which Labor says allows farmers to spend more time tending their crops.
That attention means the average Macedonian diner chows down on produce that would look extraterrestrial in an American supermarket — three-foot long leeks, softball-sized tomatoes, and red peppers you can smell from around the corner.
Labor also works on building rural tourism infrastructure across the country, and she’s helping other farmers add to their family income through agritourism. She likes manageable crowds of tourists, where, similar to her apple trees, she can give each enough individual attention. Large groups don’t allow for the same level of local hospitality.
“I don’t spend enough time with them … because you can’t pay attention to each and everybody. And then when the group leaves, I’m not happy with myself, because they didn’t see the best version of the farm,” Labor said.
The same mountains that are the bedrock of North Macedonia’s natural beauty have also served as physical barriers that form distinct cultural regions, thereby cultivating and maintaining traditions that have died elsewhere. Labor says that she can visit a region of the country just over 60 miles away and not recognize half the dishes on a table.
Although the food varies immensely by region, visitors to North Macedonia can expect some commonalities in the cuisine, which typically forgoes heavy spices in favor of letting the farm-fresh ingredients sing.
Ajvar, a creamy red pepper spread found across the Balkans, is treated with particular reverence here, with families toiling from dusk till dawn over smoky backyard grills in the fall months to make enough jars for the year.Rakija, a high-proof Balkan moonshine that Macedonians typically make from grapes, is served neat alongside heaping portions of salads, grilled meats, and oven-fresh breads.
North Macedonia’s sunny climate can take credit for one of the region’s largest wine countries, with a particular concentration in the Tikves region. Other items travelers should seek out include the buttery phyllo dough pastryborek, most often served at breakfast and grilled meatkebapi. Other local delicacies include the pork and egg boat-shaped pastrypastirmalija, with similarities to Turkish pide, and a range of hearty soups known ascorbas.
Visitors hoping to enjoy a wide variety of traditional food should look no further than the nearestkafanas, local pubs where diners are packed shoulder to shoulder in front of platters large enough to feed a village. Kafanas often feature local bands wandering table to table mariachi-style playing favorite songs for paying patrons. Mitko Panov, a Macedonian film director, sees the endurance of kafana musicians as emblematic of the persistence of Macedonian grassroots culture.
“Many countries had already lost their grassroot  entertainment,” Panov said. “How many places in the States you can go to a cafe and you can  have live music, and you can pay the guy and ask him, ‘Look, sing this song,  because I love it, and you sing it well,’ so they can sustain themselves?”
Kafanas are abundant in Skopje, especially in the cobblestone corridors of the Debar Malo neighborhood and the nearby Karposh and Bunjakovec districts of the capital city, which is located in the north of the country.
Nearly leveled in a 1963 earthquake, Skopje was part of a massive international rebuilding effort, with heavy emphasis on traditional Yugoslav brutalism. The city’s Old Bazaar layers that brutalism next to centuries-old Ottoman designs and a newer Vegas-style neoclassicism. Visitors looking for anything from fresh produce to dive bars and antiques will find it in the bazaar’s tangle of alleys, and they just might get lost along the way.
Cafe tables in the bazaar and beyond are packed from early morning to late night, and matcha lattes have a home alongside Turkish coffee.
The mid-sized city punches above its weight in terms of cultural events, including jazz, film, and music festivals. Much of this is a holdover from the country’s Yugoslavian days, when the government heavily subsidized cultural centers and arts programming.
For travelers looking for a break after long nights of kafanas and hopping between the city’s numerous cocktail bars, the countryside just beyond Skopje is full of attractions, including the funicular to Vodno Cross, a towering steel cross that sits on a peak offering panoramic views of the city and mountains in the distance. Visitors can also kayak across billiard-green waters in Matka Canyon or visit the canyon’s numerous Martian-like caves, home to surrealist dripping stalactites and a regular stop on the global cave-diving circuit. Ambitious hiking tours on offer navigate the spines of the mountains, taking tourists to all three.

Trump said he’s looking into an Australian-style retirement program for America. Here’s how it works,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/economy/superannuation-australia-retirement-trump,"Dec 3, 2025, 12:26 PM ET","The Trump administration is looking Down Under for inspiration on how to improve the United States’ retirement savings system.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday said at the White House that his administration is looking into an Australian-style retirement program.
“We’re looking at it very seriously,” Trump said. “It’s a good plan. It’s worked out very well.”
Australia’s primary retirement savings program — known as “superannuation” — might have caught the attention of Washington officials.
Superannuation, or “super” for short, is Australia’s flagship retirement savings program.
Employers are required to fund employees’ savings accounts, which are invested in select funds — known as super funds — that are locked up until retirement. The employer-funded contributions are made on top of paying employees their regular income. Employees can also contribute to their own savings account.
Employers must contribute the equivalent of 12% of an employee’s income into these super funds — a gradual increase from 3% when the modern superannuation program was established in 1992.
“There is no opt out,” Tim Jenkins, partner at consulting firm Mercer, told CNN. “If you are employed, your employer must pay 12% of your pay to your retirement savings, and it’s locked up until you’re approaching retirement age with a few ways to access on the way, but very limited indeed.”
Australia’s super funds are the fourth-largest retirement savings pool in the world despite the country’s ranking as the 55th largest country by population size, according toJPMorgan Chase.
The total superannuation investment pool has roughly 4.5 trillion Australian dollars in assets (roughly $3 trillion).
Employees can choose from different super funds. The funds are managed by professional investors such as financial institutions, regulated by the government and are invested across a variety of global assets from stocks to private equity.
Australia’s superannuation program was introduced to address concerns about an aging population and how to help people support themselves in retirement.
“With an aging population and declining birth rates, a system like this takes the fiscal burden off future generations,” Jenkins said.
Australia’s retirement system is ranked B+ on the Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index for 2025. Meanwhile, the United States is ranked C+.
There is also a government pension program that serves as a safety net for people who need additional support. However, “super” is increasingly the primary retirement savings vehicle.
In the United States, employer-sponsored retirement programs like 401(k)s — which were first established in 1978 — are optional. Employers who offer 401(k) plans can decide whether they will match employees’ contributions.
Social Security, which was established in 1935 under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, serves as the primary vehicle for retirement income. US workers and employers pay Social Security tax, which pools into a fund that is distributed to current retirees. Concerns have been mounting that Social Security funds are on shaky grounds as the US population ages.
In general, Australia’s compulsory employer-funded investment savings plan stands in contrast to the US system where voluntary 401(k)s are paired with the long-standing Social Security program.
Social Security won’t be able to pay full benefits in 2034 if Congress doesn’t act
It’s unclear whether the United States would be able to implement a similar program to the superannuation model, especially given the politics associated with changing retirement plans. Australia also has a population of 27 million, while the United States has a population of roughly 343 million.
Trump’s mention of Australia’s retirement system wasn’t the first time it has come up in his administration. Australian super funds are major investors in US assets, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke at a superannuation summit in Washington, D.C., in February, where he touted the program’s success.
Matthew Linden, executive general manager of strategy and insights at Super Members Council, who attended thesummitin February, said: “What has struck US officials and investors is how the strength of Australia’s super system policy settings — automatic super payments, near universal coverage and preservation of savings until retirement — have helped Australians grow world-leading retirement nest eggs.”"

"Trump floats $2,000 tariff rebate checks. What you need to know",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/economy/tariff-rebate-check-proposal-what-to-know,"Nov 10, 2025, 10:56 AM ET","President Donald Trump, embattled by America’s growingaffordability problems, has once again floated a unique solution: Sending Americans rebate checks for the tariffs that his administration has collected.
“People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trumpposted on Truth SocialSunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”
It’s a bold promise with several significant complications.
Trump has frequently floated the idea of tariff rebate checks. Prior to this weekend’s proposal, Trump in August had said Americans couldreceive a portion of the tariff revenue.
“We’re taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,” Trump said at the time.
While American importers foot the initial tariff bill, they’ve been passing along some of those added costs to consumers, meaning Americans are indirectly paying for tariffs, too.
The idea sounds similar to stimulus checks that went out in the wake of the pandemic recession — once towards the end of Trump’s first term, in 2020; and again in 2021 when former President Joe Biden was in office. But Trump suggested that these tariff rebate checks could be funded not by a general pool of taxpayer funds but instead from the money collected by US importers who pay the historic tariffs Trump has imposed on a vast number of goods from overseas.
Trump’s top economic adviser threw some cold water on the rebate checks.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was noncommittal about the proposal on Sunday in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” Bessent said no formal proposals have been made to distribute tariff revenue and suggested Trump’s mention of a $2,000 payment “could come in lots of forms,” including making up for lost revenue from not taxing tips, overtime and Social Security payments.
The Trump administration has collected more than $220 billion in tariff revenue, which includes a mix of various tariffs Trump has imposed and previous tariffs that were in place before Trump took office, according to the US Treasury.
More than 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024, theIRS said.
So a back-of-the-envelope calculation would put $2,000 stimulus checks at a total cost of about $326 billion. That’s more than the tariff revenue America has collected since Trump’s second term began.
Trump said he would exclude wealthy Americans, but it’s not clear where the cut-off would be and whether that could make up for the difference.
Even with an income threshold of $100,000 — far from the highest income tax bracket — around 150 million adults would qualify. That would cost the administration roughly $300 billion, wrote Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, in a post on X.
Trump’s $2,000 tariff dividend may be a smart political move. But it would be a huge economic gamble
According to a Monday morning social media post, the president seems to think there would be enough money left after tariff rebate checks are doled out to help pay down the nation’s nearly $40 trillion in debt.
“All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens, from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries, which will be substantial, will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
A White House official didn’t specify what requirements would need to be met to qualify for a check. “The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,” the official told CNN.
Another complicating factor: TheSupreme Court appears skepticalof the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. About $100 billion of the total tariff revenue so far has been collected through this method.
If the court rules against the Trump administration, it may have toreturn that money to businesses, which would significantly reduce the amount of tariff money available as a rebate for American households.
It could also complicate the process of refunding businesses if money has already been distributed to individuals.
Almost certainly not.
Congress maintains the power of the purse, and past stimulus checks have required Congressional approval, and it’s unclear if Trump has enough support to pass something like this.
Although stimulus checks have proven politically popular in the past, they have come almost exclusively during recessions or emergencies. The American economy is in neither at the moment.
Rebate checks could exacerbate rising prices at a time when Americans sayinflation and affordabilityare their top concern. Sending out checks could give America’s economy a sugar rush at the worst possible time and could ultimately ding American households if the Federal Reserve needs to hike its benchmark interest rate to counteract rising prices.
That could lose Trump some key votes among fiscal conservatives in his own party.
Even if the rebate checks get approval, don’t hold your breath.
During the pandemic, Americans who elected to receive direct deposit checks had the money in their bank accounts within about a week of the first stimulus package passing. Where it got much more dicey was for the Americans who elected to receive paper checks. That process took around 20 weeks."
How life changed in a rural town that lost its clinic after Trump’s megabill,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/30/politics/trump-one-big-beautiful-bill-rural-healthcare,"Nov 30, 2025, 7:01 AM ET","As the final hues of autumn linger in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the 200-person community of Churchville, Virginia, is grappling with the loss of its health clinic.
Gone are the days of seniors walking down the road from their house to see the town doctor.
Augusta Medical Groupcited the health care provisionsin President Donald Trump’s signaturelegislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, for closing the rural clinics in Churchville and two other locations.
“I’ve called around trying to find a replacement, a new doctor, and for just a well-being appointment, the soonest is the end of January,” said Teresa Leach, 56, in an interview while sipping her coffee at the MTN. Mystic shop just a few feet from the shuttered clinic. Leach, who has asthma, said she voted for Trump last year.
Democrats are hoping to make health care a defining issue nationally in next year’s midterms. But the environment in Churchville illustrates the challenges the party faces, particularly in rural communities.
Trump carried Augusta County, which includes Churchville, by nearly 50 points in 2024. Jena Crisler, a physician, ran to represent the area in the Virginia House of Delegates and lost this month to the Republican incumbent by more than 40 points even in a Democratic statewide sweep.
A woman sitting in the same coffee shop whispered under her breath that she supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. It takes her over an hour to visit her doctors in Charlottesville. Rural health care is always precarious, she says, and the clinic closure was especially a blow for her husband.
But she said she wouldn’t put up a sign for a Democrat “because of the environment,” and she declined to be named by CNN.
Across the street from the coffee shop, a sign in the window of a storefront reads, “Thank you, Trump, Save America Again.”
Rural health providers that rely on Medicaid funding were already under strain before the bill cut federal health spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, primarily by instituting work requirements and more eligibility checks.
In a statement, the US Department of Health and Human Services noted that the bill created a $50 billion fund for rural healthcare.
“It will be the largest single rural health care investment in United States history,” HHS said in a statement. “Those funds will be deployed to support health systems in underserved, rural communities early next year.”
The policy research organization KFFestimatesthat Trump’s bill will cut federal Medicaid spending in rural communities by $137 billion over the next decade.
Here’s how Trump’s megabill will affect you
Lynlee Thorne, political director of Rural Ground Game, a group focused on driving up Democratic participation in rural areas, says Democrats will continue highlighting the significance of accessible health care through town hall-style events and canvassing, trying to win back credibility and trust in rural America.
“I think people have an interest in having real conversations about what’s going on with their lives, and there’s really nothing that can replace that person to person at your doorstep conversation,” Thorne said.
Crisler knew she faced long odds when she took on incumbent Delegate Chris Runion in the state’s 35th district. She suggests her race was less about the outcome and more about the need for Democrats to show up everywhere instead of simply surrendering communities where they’re outnumbered.
“I think they are very concerned, and they’re going to be even more when it starts hitting them personally,” said Crisler of the clinic closures.
A spokesperson for Runion said he was not available for comment.
CNN has reached out to US Rep. Ben Cline, a Republican who represents the area in Washington and voted for the Trump policy bill. His office did not respond.
Pediatrician Mark Downey defeated incumbent Republican Chad Green in the state’s 69th district, which includes Newport News, York, James City and Gloucester counties. In an interview with CNN, he said it’s important Democrats continue to run on health care even if the message does not immediately resonate with voters.
“It may not happen overnight. People’s minds don’t change right away, but when they start seeing loss of access, loss of services, eventually there’s going to be a situation where it’s not going to be as convenient for them or more of a hardship for them,” said Downey, who had made two previous unsuccessful tries for the state legislature.
Irene Holmes, 59, moved to Churchville three years ago. When her son died, she and her husband wanted a change of scenery from New York. Beset with a host of medical challenges from liver issues to high blood pressure, she relied on and valued the town clinic.
“I’m a mixed bag of tricks, a lot of medical issues,” she said.
On politics, she tends to “keep her mouth shut” to avoid getting into it with her neighbors. But when asked if Trump was to blame for the clinic closure, Holmes said, “Absolutely.”
“What he’s done is destroying rural areas,” said Holmes.
Dale White, a Churchville resident and church administrator, says the concerns about the clinic are overblown.
“These are old-time rural farming folks, and they’ve been going to get medical care in Staunton and Fishersville, Waynesboro and Charlottesville since they can remember,” said White.
Back at the MTN. Mystic coffeehouse, shop owner Dane Buse suggests now is the time for rural communities to get creative.
“To lose the clinic is the same as losing a grocery store or a local provider,” Buse said.
He suggested the community could band together to find a doctor to make house calls.
“Maybe that would fit the bill for us,” Buse said.

What the heck is going on at Apple?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/06/tech/apple-tim-cook-leadership-changes,"Dec 6, 2025, 3:00 AM ET","Apple for decades has been known for a consistent string of design-forward, tech-defining consumer products that have shaped how people use technology.
Now the company known for its steadiness is going through a shakeup at the top, as both Apple and the tech industry at large are at a crossroads.
Apple announced the departures of three executive team members in less than a week. Meta poached a key Apple design leader. And speculation is mounting thatTim Cook may be preparingto step aside as CEO.
The changes come as critics say Apple, once a tech leader, is behind in the next big wave: artificial intelligence. For one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, a change in leadership could mean a change in how it conceives, designs and creates products used around the world every single day.
“The only thing we can read into this is that we’re headed to a time of increased volatility for Apple,” said Robert Siegel, a longtime venture capitalist and lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business.
Apple stock (AAPL) is up roughly 12% this year, a much smaller jump than the 30% increase it saw in 2024.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Planned departures for the following Apple executives were announced just this week:
Apple is bringing in Meta chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead to lead government affairs after Adams retires and serve as its new general counsel. The environment and social initiatives teams will now report to Sabih Khan, Apple’s chief operating officer. Amar Subramanya, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of AI, will be Apple’s new vice president of AI.
And earlier this year, Jeff Williams stepped back from his role as Apple’s chief operating officer.
Apple isn’t the only tech giant making structural changes. Meta on Thursday said it’s shifting some investmentaway from its Metaverse virtual reality projectand towards AI glasses and wearables. Amazonlaid off 14,000 people in Octoberas part of a push to move faster in AI by operating more leanly. And Googlelast yearcombined its hardware and software teams to better integrate AI into its products across the board.
But Apple is known for having a uniquely tight-knit company culture driven by secrecy.
“This is against the typical culture of Apple. But they need to rip the Band-Aid off,” said Dan Ives, global head of tech research for Wedbush Securities. “Because the AI strategy has been invisible, and it’s going to define Cook’s legacy, how he handles this chapter.”
The leadership shakeup comes as questions about Apple’s future loom.
Apple delayed a major update to its Siri voice assistant that was expected to bring it closer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, turning Siri from a question-and-answer machine into an assistant that can act on a user’s behalf and incorporate information from a person’s phone to personalize responses.
But that upgrade has been pushed offuntil next year, and Apple’s other AI updates for iPhones, Macs and iPads have been minimal this year.
AndApple’s expensive Vision Pro headset, the first new computing category the company has introduced since the decade-old Apple Watch, is still a niche product.
At the same time, Meta, Google, Samsung and OpenAI have announced significant product expansions in AI this year – from Meta’s newRay-Ban Displaysmart glasses to Google and Samsung’sGemini-powered headsetand OpenAI’s push intoshoppingandweb browsers. Google’s Gemini 3 model has also beenmaking wavessince its November launch.
Wall Street wants answers about Apple’s AI strategy. In a July earnings call, analysts asked Apple about Siri’s role in driving new products and whether AI chatbots are threatening Apple’s relevance in internet searches. Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, even said during his testimony in a Google antitrust hearing that peoplemay not need an iPhone 10 years from now.
Now Dye, largely the face of Apple’s design studio following the 2019 departure of former design chief Jony Ive, is joining Meta to help shape what the company sees as the next wave of computing. And Ive is helping OpenAIcreate its first hardware product.
Dye’s decision to join Meta is “more of a direct threat to Apple” compared to the other announced departures, said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund.
Despite facing pressure in AI,iPhone 17 saleshave been strong and are only expected to climb higher next year. Apple is expected to surpass Samsung in smartphone shipments this year for the first time since 2011, according to Counterpoint Research. The company is also one of the few tocross the $4 trillionmarket capitalization threshold, along with AI giants Nvidia and Microsoft.
And change isn’t always a bad thing, according to Siegel, especially while industries are going through transitions as the tech sector currently is with AI. Bringing in new hires or promoting people from within can “give a different point of view when a company can get trapped in a way of thinking and doing things,” he said.
That could be just what Apple needs, as some analysts say the clock is ticking for Apple to make bigger leaps in AI.
“You can’t have a fourth industrial revolution and watch the AI party through the windows on the outside,” said Ives. “And clearly they need massive changes in leadership.”"
Trump’s push for health care plan stalls ahead of looming subsidy expiration,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/politics/health-care-plan-trump-stall-aca,"Dec 2, 2025, 12:31 PM ET","President Donald Trump’s push for anew health care planhas stalled, amiddisagreements within the GOPover the extension of key enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, three people familiar with the matter told CNN.
The dispute has slowed the administration’s efforts to avert alooming spikein health insurance premiums, raising doubts about whether it will have any proposal ready in time for a Senate vote as early as next week on the fate of the ACA subsidies relied on by roughly 22 million people.
The White House initially expected to roll out a plan last week that paired an extension of the subsidies with a range of conservative reforms meant to limit their scope. But that was scrapped following sharp backlash from Republican lawmakers who were blindsided by the framework and deeply opposed to its core elements.
Trump officials attempting to rework the proposal are now unlikely to finalize a new plan this week, the people familiar with the matter said, raising the odds that Senate Republicans will be left without a Trump-endorsed proposal to counter Democrats’ call for passing a simple extension of the ACA subsidies before the funding expires at the end of the year.
The White House declined to comment.
Trump has continued to push aides to develop a health care plan over worries that voters will blame him for rising premiums should he fail to present an alternative, and the administration could still reach a sudden breakthrough, the people familiar with the matter cautioned.
At a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump insisted that “something’s going to happen,” though he acknowledged it was far from a sure bet.
“It’s probably not going to be easy,” he said, complaining that Democrats “don’t want to make a good deal for the people.”
Republicans in Congress, too, have been privately ramping up pressure on the administration to get behind a plan that averts steep price hikes in 2026 — a critical midterm year that could endanger their own seats.
Some GOP lawmakers, particularly moderate members of the caucus, are keenly aware that many Affordable Care Act enrollees are Republican. In fact, the enhanced subsidies helped spur a record 24 million people to sign up for 2025 coverage, many of them from red states. More than half of Obamacare enrollees live in districts represented by a Republican, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.
“I encouraged the president to continue on this path of trying to move forward with a temporary extension,” said GOP Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York, who added that Congress would still need to overhaul the underlying structure of the ACA subsidies. “We have to do our best to protect American people and consumers.”
If the Biden-era subsidies expire, the premiums people pay are expected to more than double next year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. Plus, an estimated 2 million more people will be uninsured next year, the Congressional Budget Office found.
Still, the administration’s initial stumbles underscore the steep challenge that the White House faces in winning consensus within the GOP on any major health care proposal — much less one that has a shot at garnering enough support from Democrats to make it into law.
Senate Republicans agreed to hold a vote this month on extending the ACA subsidies as part of a deal with Democrats to fund the government  and end a record-long shutdown. Most Republican lawmakers are staunchly opposed to a simple extension.
“The bottom line is, let them expire,” GOP Rep. Keith Self of Texas said Tuesday when asked about his preferred plan for addressing the looming cliff.
Trump has similarly signaled his opposition to a simple extension, calling instead for a plan that would send federal funding directly to consumers, rather than paying it to insurance companies to subsidize health care premiums. He repeatedly criticized the ACA as an unsalvageable “disaster,” prompting a scramble among Republican lawmakers to draw up plans that fit with his mandate that “all the money go to the people, and that the people go out and buy their own health care.”
Yet within the administration, officials ultimately opted for a somewhat different approach, crafting a proposal that modified the existing ACA subsidy program rather than overhauling it in hopes of putting pressure on moderate Democrats to strike a quick deal.
The White House’s original framework would have extended the subsidies for two years, but set new income limits and required that all enrollees pay a minimum monthly premium. It also proposed incentivizing people to pick lower-tier plans by allowing them to funnel some federal aid into health savings accounts. And it would have set the stage to allow consumers to pick less expensive but less comprehensive plans outside the Affordable Care Act exchanges, which would likely undermine Obamacare.
The dissonance between Trump’s rhetoric and his plan surprised many conservatives on Capitol Hill, who rejected the idea of voting to continue part of a health care law they’ve opposed for more than a decade. That division over continuing the subsidies in any form, or allowing them to expire, has prevented the party from coalescing behind a single proposal.
Roughly 22 million people benefit from the enhanced tax credits, which polling shows are broadly popular with voters. That has raised fears among some Trump advisers and Republican lawmakers about the political ramifications of letting them run out, which would push premiums higher at a moment when much of the electorate is already unhappy with the cost of living.
“I think we need to do something,” said Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, a battleground Republican who has been a vocal supporter of preventing those health care price hikes, while working to fix what he calls a broken system.
Asked whether anything can be done before the end-of-the-year expiration of funding for the enhanced subsidies, LaLota pointed to Congress’ tendency to act only ahead of key deadlines: “Time winds up becoming a pressure cooker.”
Trump administration officials in recent days have sought to resolve lawmakers’ concerns over continuing the subsidies, the people familiar with the matter said, including exploring ways to maintain the funding through some alternate program that members might be more willing to support.
They are also grappling with demands that any plan including so-called Hyde protections prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortion — a key GOP priority, yet one that would complicate any prospect of winning Democratic support.
But with the Senate poised to vote as soon as next week, the prospect of striking a deal ahead of that deadline has grown exceedingly dim.
Some Republicans, like Malliotakis, have been in private talks with rank-and-file Democrats for weeks to find a path forward that can win support in both chambers.
“This is not a problem that Republicans created, and so Republicans on their own will not be able to resolve it,” Malliotakis said. “This needs to be a bipartisan solution.”

Trump to announce $12 billion farm aid package at roundtable,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/08/politics/farm-aid-package-trump-tariffs,"Dec 8, 2025, 11:03 AM ET","President Donald Trump is expected to announce a $12 billion farm aid package at a roundtable on Monday, a White House official told CNN.
Most of the aid — $11 billion — will be directed toward crop farmers through one-time payments under the Farmer Bridge Assistance program, according to the official. The rest will go to farmers whose crops fall outside the umbrella of the assistance program.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins will attend the roundtable, which is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET at the White House. Corn, cotton, sorghum, soybean, rice, cattle, wheat and potato farmers will also attend.
The farm aid announcement details were first reported byBloomberg, but Rollins hinted at the bridge payments at a Cabinet meeting last week.
Rollins suggested that it was not the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs, but rather Biden administration policies, that have caused farmers to need assistance. She credited Trump for opening the markets through trade deals without directly acknowledging how tariffs have impacted farmers.
“What you’ve been able to do is open those markets up and again, move toward an era where our farmers are not so reliant on government checks, but have the markets to sell their product. Having said that, we do have a bridge payment we’ll be announcing with you next week, as we’re still trying to recover from the Biden years,” Rollins said.
“For so long, our farmers, many of them, have been farming for government checks instead of moving their product around the world. These trade deals change that forever,” Rollins said.
Some farmers have previously balked at the idea of aid. Mark Read, District 5 director for the Illinois Soybean Association, previouslytold CNN, “Farmers don’t want free aid. We want free trade.” This was before China agreed to again purchase soybeans from US farmers afterturning to Brazil and Argentinaamid a trade war.
In late September, Rollins said the farm economy, and especially row croppers, was facing “a significant challenge right now,” calling the impact of Trump’s tariffs a “time of uncertainty.”
“The president’s commitment of a ‘golden age’ for rural America, for our American farmers and workers, is just around the corner, but he has been very clear … that there could be a time of uncertainty, especially for our farmers and ranchers, and it’s clear we’re in that time of uncertainty now,” Rollins said at the time."
Trump made big gains with Latino voters in 2024. Now they’re up for grabs again,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/07/politics/latino-swing-voters-trump,"Dec 7, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","The rapid erosion of President Donald Trump’s support among Latinos underscores how this growing group is poised to become the largest bloc of movable voters in the electorate.
In 2024, Trump achieved historic breakthroughs in virtually every segment of the Latino community. Just over a year later, polls and election results alike show that Trump’s Latino support is ebbing just as comprehensively.
In a massive surveyof Latinos released late last month, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found him declining among all major groups in the Latino community — with even about one-fifth of Latinos who said they voted for Trump just a year earlier saying they disapproved of his performance as president.
“Nationally, there’s no evidence that the Trump 2024 Hispanic numbers will become a new baseline for Republicans,” said Matt Barreto, a Democratic pollster and political scientist at UCLA. “The only evidence is to the contrary.”
This swift reversal has undermined theconfidentpredictionsof many conservatives that Trump had engineered a durable realignment among Latino voters, primarily around conservative cultural values. In 2026, Trump’s slippage among Latinos could become a major challenge for Republicans in the battle for the House of Representatives, including by confounding their plan to flip several heavily Latino Democratic seats through this year’sunusual mid-decade redistricting in Texas.
Yet even if discontent with Trump allows Democrats to recover next year with Latinos, few analysts on either side believe that will signal a return to the era when the party could rely on large and stable advantages among them.
Mike Madrid, a longtime Republican consultant who has become a fierce Trump critic, said the Latino backlash against Trump is just the latest turn in a process of “dealignment” that has seen this community toggle between the parties in frustration over both sides’ inability to ease their economic strains. “Latinos are now a true swingy vote,” said Madrid, author of the 2024 book “The Latino Century.” “But they are not voting for aspirational, positive reasons; they are punishing whoever is in power.”
Trump’s 2024 gains with Latinos are difficult to overstate. Geographically, he improved in Latino communities from South Texas to the South Bronx. He gained among Mexican Americans in the Southwest, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans in the Northeast, and Central and South Americans in South Florida.
Demographically, his reach was equally panoramic. Three major data sources used to estimate voter behavior —the exit polls conducted by Edison Researchfor a consortium of media organizations including CNN,the Pew Research Center’s Validated Voters analysis, andthe projections by Catalist, a Democratic data and targeting firm — told a similar story.
Trump’s gains among Latino men understandably attracted the most attention, since the exit polls, Pew and Catalist all showed him winning a majority of them, something no previous Republican nominee had done. But each of those sources also showed Trump gaining substantially compared with 2020 among Latinas. Likewise, Trump not only ran historically well among Latinos without a four-year college degree but also notched significant gains among those with such degrees. And while Trump — as is usually true for Republicans — ran best among Latino Protestants, many of whom identify as evangelical Christians, he also improved dramatically with Latino Catholics.
In all, the different data sources agreed Trump in 2024 swelled his Latino vote to around 45%, more than any previous Republican presidential nominee, according to exit polls. That represented a substantial gain from the roughly 35% he drew in 2020 — which was itself an improvement from 2016, when Trump carried only around 3 in 10 Latinos, according to the exit polls, Pew and Catalist.
Little over a year later, the picture looks very different. Trump’s approval rating among Latinosstarted declining soon after he took office in January— as it did with other groups where he notched his most notable advances in 2024, such as younger and Black men.
The Pew survey released last monthput an exclamation point on these trends. The poll surveyed an unusually large group of Latino respondents (about 5,000), which allowed for more detailed analysis of subgroups within the community than public polls usually permit.
That analysis showed Trump’s 2025 retreat among Latinos has been as panoramic as his 2024 ascent. The survey, for instance, found that not only did 73% of Latinas disapprove of Trump’s performance as president, but so did 67% of Latino men; not only did three-fourths of Latino Catholics and those unaffiliated with any religion disapprove, but so did nearly three-fifths of Protestants. In 2024, Trump carried a solid majority of Latino men without a college degree — the intersection of the educational and gender dynamics that most benefited him — but Pew found that a stunning two-thirds of them now disapproved of his performance.
Trump’s major policy initiatives faced withering reviews in the survey. On the economy, the share of Latinos who said his policies were worsening conditions (61%) was four times the number who said he was improving them (15%). About 7 in 10 said he was doing too much to deport undocumented immigrants.
Most strikingly, nearly 8 in 10 said they believed his policies overall are hurting the Latino community, compared with only 1 in 10 who believed they are helping it. (The remainder thought his policies were having no effect.) This discontent extended widely into the Latino groups that supported Trump most enthusiastically in 2024, such as men without a college degree and Latino Protestants, according to unpublished results provided by Pew to CNN. Trump’s strong 2024 performance among younger Latinos (especially men) was exhibit A for those claiming he had triggered a lasting realignment, but in the Pew results, almost exactly half of Latinos younger than 50who voted for Trump last yearsaid his policies are now hurting the community.
Like other pollsters from both parties, Barreto of UCLA said that even many Latinos who voted for Trump in 2024 had substantial doubts about him at the time — but shifted to him anyway because they thought he was more likely to ease their cost-of-living squeeze than Harris would. “I think a lot of people who voted for him, they didn’t like him, but they did hope he was going to fix the economy,” Barreto said. “But … there haven’t been a lot of huge wins you can sell to working-class voters.”
While Latinos have not received the economic relief they expected, Trump is delivering more than many — rightly or wrongly — say they anticipated in his highly militarized campaign of mass deportation.
“What Latino voters who voted for Trump are clearly telling us — it may sound odd to some people — is that they earnestly thought that he would just go after undocumented immigrants who had criminal records, and they were OK with that,” said Rafael Collazo, executive director of UnidosUS Action Fund, which focuses on Latino voters. “Now they are seeing that’s not the case, and they are pushing back on that.”
The results in last month’sgubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginiamade clear that Trump’s decline in the Latino community has direct electoral consequences for other Republicans. In their decisive victories, Democratic candidates Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia each carried about two-thirds of Latino voters — much more than Harris did in those states just the year before,according to the Voter Poll conducted by SRSSfor a consortium of media organizations including CNN. And vote returns from places with large Latino populations in each state suggest significant shifts from Republicans to Democrats compared with 2024.
If Latino voters shift in comparable numbers next year, that alone could topple the GOP’snarrow House majority. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and outside groups such as the UnidosUS Action PAC are targeting House Republican seats with significant Latino populations in states from Arizona and Colorado to New Jersey and Pennsylvania. “The map is much bigger than we would have anticipated a month ago,” Collazo said.
Latinos may be especially pivotal to the outcome of this year’s two biggest redistricting fights. In California, Latinos will constitute a majority of the votein the reconfigured House districtsthat Democrats hope to flip from Republican Reps. David Valadao and Ken Calvert, as well as in the seat they redrew to fortify Democratic Rep. Adam Gray. Latinos will also represent an increased minority of the vote in the seat Democrats expect to take from Rep. Darrell Issa.
Meanwhile, Texas Republicans, under pressure from Trump, redrew their congressional maps this year in the hope of capturing five seats now held by Democrats. In four of those districts, including the South Texas seats now held by Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, Latinos constitute a majority of eligible voters,according to the Texas Tribune. Latinos are also a majority of voters in the nearby seat held by Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz, which is Democrats’ top offensive target in the state.
Wayne Hamilton, a Republican political consultant who runs Project Red TX, an organization dedicated to growing the party in South Texas, brushes off concerns that the results in New Jersey or Virginia could signal trouble for the GOP with Latinos there. South Texas, he said, is booming economically, and Trump’s immigration agenda has broad support in low-income communities along the Mexican border that were “overrun by illegal immigration” under President Joe Biden.
After Trump’s moves to stiffen security at the border, people in South Texas “are beginning to get some normalcy back in their lives,” Hamilton said.
And yet,pollsby the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin show the share of Texas Latinos expressing a favorable view of Trump has plummeted from about one-half in fall 2024 to about 1 in 3 now. After Trump’s dramatic rise with Texas Latinos last year, the evidence suggests “what we’re seeing now is a reversion to the norm,” said James Henson, director of the project. To the extent anyone is using Trump’s 2024 showing “as a baseline for voting behavior, particularly among Latinos,” he added, “they are going to overestimate Republican turnout. Period.”
None of the GOP strategists I spoke with expressed much optimism Trump could substantially reverse his Latino decline before the midterm elections. Republican pollster Daron Shaw,who conducted a large survey of Latinos this fallwith Barreto’s firm for UnidosUS, said he can envision the GOP preserving its support in South Texas and South Florida. But beyond those enclaves, “you are getting kind of late in the cycle for Republicans to turn the economy around,” said Shaw, who is also a government professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “Latinos who traditionally voted Democratic [but] sat out in 2024, or maybe even switched to Trump, I think Republicans are in a rough way with them.”
Alfonso Aguilar, a longtime Hispanic Republican strategist who now serves as senior director for government affairs at Defending Education, sees somewhat more opportunity but worries that too many GOP leaders are blinded by “triumphalism” over Trump’s 2024 gains — and ignoring the evidence of regression since. In particular, Aguilar said that allowing polarizing figures such as top White House adviser Stephen Miller and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to drive such a combative message on immigration enforcement is alienating Latinos.
“If your audience is a certain sector within the MAGA base, it is great communication,” Aguilar said. “But if you want to maintain the broad coalition that achieved the historic victory in 2024, that has to change.”
Republican former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who represented a heavily Latino South Florida seat, also believes “it’s going to be hard for Republicans to recover some of [the] support” Trump has lost this year. “The only political solutions for the erosion Republicans have seen is for affordability to improve in the country and for immigration enforcement to come back to a place where most people can be supportive of it — which would mean the deporting [only] of people who are criminals, or a true burden on society,” he said.
For all these reasons and more, Madrid, Barreto and others I spoke to said Democrats had a realistic chance to push their Latino vote share in 2026 back toward the two-thirds or higher level they frequently reached before 2020. But even if they do, many believe those gains could prove just as evanescent as Trump’s from 2024. “There is a lot of evidence that Latino party identification is not as rigid as that of some other groups,” said Henson, in a view echoed by many of those I spoke with.
That leaves Latinos more open than most voters to switching their allegiance based on their assessment of immediate conditions, such as the economy or immigration policy. Both of those concerns drove Latinos away from Democrats in 2024; now they are alienating many from Trump. “You could argue that Latinos are the only voters voting the way you should in a healthy democracy: which is that you are willing to change your voting habits when somebody is doing something bad for you,” said Madrid, the GOP consultant.
The relentless churn of the Latino electorate adds to this fluidity. Demographer William Frey of the Brookings Metro think tank forecasts that about 1.1 million US-born Latinos will turn 18 and become eligible to vote every year for at least the next quarter-century. Shaw and Barreto, in their poll for UnidosUS, found that two-fifths of Latinos who voted in 2024 cast their first ballot in that election, 2022 or 2020. Because the Latino electorate “is so young, because it’s growing, because there are naturalized voters coming in, it’s constantly in flux,” Barreto said.
Even as they grow and disperse, Latinos have become one of the few moving pieces in an electorate where most voters,as political scientists say, appear “calcified” in their unbreakable loyalty to one party or the other. “The idea that there is this real deep natural affinity for the Democrats [among Latinos] is as problematic as thinking they are now hard-core Republicans,” Shaw said. In a nation sorted so immovably between antagonistic coalitions of red and blue, Latinos appear solidly purple."
"Entering election year, Netanyahu’s government targets Israel’s free press",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/01/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-press-freedom-crackdown-intl,"Dec 1, 2025, 12:47 PM ET","What began as Israel’s leader cold-shouldering the mainstream media is becoming a more widespread assault on the country’s freedom of the press.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not granted an interview to Israel’s three main broadcasters in over four years. He’s accused them of “brainwashing,” claimed they assist Israel’s enemies and personally gone after journalists who criticize him.
Now, that longstanding tension is evolving into something more aggressive.: On Monday, Netanyahu’s coalition will establish a special parliamentary committee to advance legislation that would replace Israel’s independent media regulators with political appointees. The change will give the government sweeping authority to fine and sanction news outlets – a move critics warn could permanently reshape the country’s media environment.
The bill, sponsored by Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi, a Netanyahu loyalist, passed its first reading last month after it was introduced in May. The government says its goal is to open the market, promote competition, remove outdated regulatory barriers and modernize Israel’s media laws for the digital era.
Israeli networks, however, have warned the proposed reform will expand political influence and erode editorial independence. In an unprecedented move, the rival networks created a joint emergency forum in August 2023 to oppose the government’s plans, which they dub a “hostile takeover” of the media market.
An official in the forum told CNN, “What we’re seeing is an attempted power grab on the eve on an election. The clear objective is to subdue the free press and silence criticism before Israelis go to the polls.”
The media regulation bill is part of a broader set of restrictions and measures taken against freedom of the press in Israel. Earlier this year, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) dropped Israel’sranking to 112 out of 180 countriesin the World Press Freedom Index. “Disinformation campaigns and repressive laws have multiplied in Israel and pressure on Israeli journalists has intensified,” RSF said.
A bill originally aimedat banning Qatar-based Al-Jazeerais currently being expanded to empower the government to shutter certain foreign outlets without court oversight in the name of “national security.” Another bill would privatize Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan 11.
Defence Minister Israel Katz recently announced he will close Galei Tzahal (Army Radio) next year. While some have questioned the existence of a military-run broadcaster in a democracy, the timing aligns with the government’s wider moves to consolidate control over the media sphere.
And all of this is unfolding as Israel has barred foreign journalists from independently entering Gaza since the start of the war more than two years ago. Reporters Without Borders said the ban constitutes “an unprecedented violation of press freedom and the public’s right to reliable, independent, and pluralistic media reporting.”
The media regulation bill has already faced criticism from the national regulatory agency, the Finance and Justice ministries, the Knesset’s own legal advisers and the attorney general. “The proposal creates increased risks to Israel’s free media,” Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara wrote in a legal opinion submitted to the government in September, raising “a real concern about commercial and political influence and involvement in the work of media organizations in general and in news broadcasts in particular.”
Despite legal objections from both the government’s legal adviser and the Knesset’s legal counsel, Karhi is pressing ahead. The communications minister, who accused the press of “weakening Israel internally” in a Knesset speech in November and claimed it enabled the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, argued in that the reform will create “true freedom of expression – not that of disgruntled people with microphones.”
As Netanyahu’s government pushes to constrain and boycott critical reporting, it has simultaneously promoted pro-Netanyahu Channel 14 – often called Israel’s Fox News – with regulatory benefits, including reduced distribution fees,  and various reliefs allowing it to operate with fewer restrictions than other commercial channels.
Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, said, “In the past two years, the Israeli government has launched a coordinated political, regulatory and rhetorical campaign to weaken the media.”
“Coalition ministers and senior politicians routinely wage public assaults on journalists, blaming the media for national failures such as the events of October 7, while violent harassment of reporters has escalated”.
The pressure isn’t only institutional. Individual journalists known for critical coverage of Netanyahu and his government endure escalating threats and intimidation, much of it with tacit or explicit backing from members of Netanyahu’s party and far-right coalition partners like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.
Guy Peleg, Channel 12’s senior legal affairs correspondent, has faced protests outside his home, threatening messages and billboard campaigns calling for his imprisonment.
The campaign against Peleg, who regularly covers Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial, isn’t new. During the 2019 election, his face appeared on Likud billboard adds alongside three other critical journalists under the slogan “They won’t decide”.
The attacks intensified after Peleg exposed the alleged abuse of a Palestinian detainee at the Sde Teiman detention facility – an affair which recently led to the resignation of the IDF’s top military lawyer.
“They want us to be afraid,” Peleg said on Channel 12’s flagship program, Ulpan Shishi. “They want us to go with security guards. What we have to say is that we will not give up and we will not be afraid and will continue doing our jobs.”
Right-wing activist Mordechai David, known for confronting journalists and opposition figures, repeatedly harassed Peleg, who eventually obtained a court-issued restraining order requiring David to stay at least two meters away.
Yet David has been welcomed by key coalition figures. Ben-Gvir hosted him in his Knesset office, praising his protests as “excellent” and a “democratic mission.” Tzvika Foghel, of Ben Gvir’s far-right wing Otzma Yehudit party,  invited him to a Knesset committee hearing on journalist harassment, despite another restraining order – from opposition lawmaker Gilad Kariv.
“The government embraces these people,” Peleg told CNN. “They are honored guests at the Knesset committees. We’re not talking about a few crazies who wrote a comment or sent a hateful message. We’re talking about a group that the government embraces, strengthens in many ways, thanks, and tells them to keep going.”
Peleg said the war against the media has several arms.
“One is through legislation in the parliament, another is through the defense minister and the army radio and a third arm sends various fringe figures to run a campaign - both online and through harassment - which is essentially kind of terror,” he said. “It’s all part of one unified system”.
Netanyahu’s current political standing is already intertwined with the media. His media maneuvering eventually led to criminal investigations and indictments, as prosecutors allege he traded regulatory benefits for positive news coverage. The Israeli prime minister is now formally seeking a pardon from Israeli President Isaac Herzog in his long-running corruption trial while refusing to acknowledge any wrongdoing.
The new mechanism Netanyahu’s government now seeks to legalize would formalize similar arrangements, which critics say would allow government ministers to reward friendly outlets and penalize critical ones.
The timing of the legislative push is significant. The next elections in Israel are scheduled for October 2026, unless Netanyahu’s coalition collapses before then. In either scenario, Israel is in an election year, where independent journalism is crucial for democratic accountability.
“As Israel enters an election year, its news organizations face unprecedented political pressure, regulatory threats, and physical intimidation,” Altshuler told CNN, “Leaving the public sphere more vulnerable than ever to influence, capture, and the erosion of democratic oversight.”"
I already have a ‘Trump Account’,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/08/economy/trump-account-personal-savings,"Dec 8, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","US citizens born between 2025 and 2028will soon be eligibleto receive $1,000 from the government in a “Trump Account,” a new tax-deferred investment vehicle whose funds become available once the child turns 18.
Although some critics say theaccountsare flawed since they don’t help parents in need of immediate financial support for their child, I believe the long-term benefits for children of all incomes far outweigh such concerns. That’s because I have my own “Trump Account” — or, rather, a much earlier version of one.
At the age of 12, when my grandfather asked me what I wanted as a bat mitzvah present, I had an unusual request: shares of General Electric.
Michael and Susan Dell donate $6.25 billion to fund ‘Trump Accounts’ for millions of American kids
On my bus rides all throughout middle school I was reading rating reports and checking the stock’s price like a hawk — far more than any investment adviser would probably recommend. Before long, I came to recognize that it was too risky to only invest in one company. So I made the case for why I should buy different companies’ stocks with bat mitzvah money I received. My father encouraged me to present him with my rationale for companies I’d want to invest in.
By high school, I had a side hustle helping friends and family members clean out their closets and then listing their goods on eBay. I put the proceeds straight into my investment account. When my siblings and I fought, they’d often joke that my parents should just drop me off at the local branch of the brokerage company I used. (In their eyes, a mutually beneficial move: I would be among fellow investment-minded people and they wouldn’t have to put up with whatever annoyance I — allegedly — had caused.)
But the joke’s on them: That small but mighty portfolio of $1,300 worth of stocks has grown to around $3,300, a nearly 150% jump over the 15 years that followed since I made my first purchase.
Funds in “Trump Accounts” can only be invested in low-cost, diversified US stock index funds, like ones that track the S&P 500, based on a law passed earlier this year.
But that’s not exactly a bad thing. For instance, if you today were to cash out on a $1,000 investment you made 18 years ago in a fund tracking the S&P 500, you’d record a gain of over 200%, or around $4,000, based on how the index performed from 2007 to 2025. (Uncle Sam would have to get a cut of that too, though.)
While there’s no guarantee any investment made today would have the same returns after 18 years, it’s not out of the question either. That’s thanks to a concept in finance known as compound interest.
It works like this: If you invest, for example, in the S&P 500, which on average has gone up 10% annually, or in any other asset that goes up over time, you end up earning interest not just on your initial investment but also on gains your investment accumulates along the way.
The best part: It doesn’t take a huge amount of money to grow a lot. It’s more about how long you stay invested, giving your money more time to collect gains that continue to stack on top of prior gains.
While I considered myself pretty advanced for a 12-year-old, that concept wasn’t one I could wrap my head around at the time — I wanted instant gratification and bragging rights about how much money I made.
But I’m thankful I somehow managed to have the intuition to stay put and hold on to almost all the stocks I purchased in middle school and high school so I can continue to observe the power of compound interest."
"Bad behavior, overcrowded streets: In Asia’s travel hot spots, overtourism is creating European-style problems",https://www.cnn.com/travel/asia-overtourism-issues-tourist-hotspots-intl-hnk-dst,"Nov 1, 2025, 4:00 AM ET","Historic towns elbow-to-elbow with travelers. Beaches where you can’t see the sand through the multitude of towels, chairs and umbrellas. Tourists arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.
That may sound like your average summer journey to any one of the many European destinationsplagued by overtourismin recent years, from Barcelona to Venice, where fed-up locals have taken to the streets to protest the negative impact of too many visitors.
But it’s happening in parts of Asia, too. Across the region, several renowned destinations are reaching a tourism glass ceiling that’s impacting the quality of life for residents while destroying the iconic spots that draw people in the first place.
“Bali is definitely one,” says Gary Bowerman, a travel and consumer trends analyst based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, when asked to specify some trouble spots.
“I would also say Kyoto in Japan. And maybe Phuket might be another.”
‘It’s 365 days a year’: Overtourism has hit several European hot spots – and locals are getting fed up
The issue isn’t space — it’s a big continent, with a lot to see, and many places are in desperate need of visitors to support their economies. The problem is that too many people are going to the same spots in the same destinations.
“Kyoto was by far the most crowded and our least favorite stop of the trip,” says Shannon Clerk, an American tourist who recently visited Japan with her sister.
To beat the anticipated crowds at the historic city’s famous Fushimi Inari Shrine, they got up at 5 a.m.
“We saw minimal people on the way up, but on the way down large hordes of tourists were arriving.”
The rest of their Kyoto visit was spent walking through busy crowds of people on the sidewalks and through the markets, she says.
“Every sacred or historical spot was overrun by non-Japanese tourists dressed in kimonos and sandals, taking Instagram photos.”
Bowerman attributes the issue to several factors, including pent-up demand after the pandemic, bargain airfares to an ever-increasing number of Asian destinations, a growing and travel-eager middle class in numerous nations (including the world’s two most populated countries, India and China), and alluring promotional campaigns by various tourist boards.
Meanwhile, more domestic tourists are exploring their own countries.
“It’s almost like the genie is out of the bottle,” says Bowerman of the travel boom. “How do you put it back in?”
The Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) reports that travel in Asia has made a spectacular recovery from the pandemic pause. According to its latest mid-year report, Northeast Asia (which includes China, Japan and South Korea) is leading the way with a phenomenal 20% tourism growth during the first six months of 2025. Even once out-of-the-way destinations likeMongoliaare reporting increases in visitor numbers.
Looking at Southeast Asia, which is about to enter its traditional high season, tourism is growing particularly quickly in Vietnam. According to the UN’s World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), international arrivals soared by 21% during the first six months of this year.
Two of Vietnam’s celebrated UNESCO World Heritage destinations have become increasingly crowded: scenic Ha Long Bay with tourist cruises and historic Hoi An with pedestrians along its narrow lanes.
“As soon as places achieve that UNESCO destination, everybody wants to go there,” Bowerman laments. “Vietnam is also very, very popular with domestic tourists as well as inbound tourism. And Vietnam is a country with more than 100 million people. There’s a lot of tourists there. There’s a lot of people going to those destinations.”
Meanwhile, Thailand’s internationalvisitor numbers are downby about 6% over last year, according to government statistics. But you’d never know it visiting some of its most popular sites.
The government in Phuket recentlyannounced plansto tackle some of the major challenges facing the island, including traffic jams and water shortages, as it struggles to keep pace with growth. Other hot-button issues on the island include waste management andmarijuana use– the 2022 decriminalization of cannabis saw a boom of dispensaries and cafes opening across the country, particularly in tourist areas.
Many visitors to Phuket take day trips to the nearby islands, including Phi Phi Islands’ Maya Bay, made famous by 2000 film “The Beach,” starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Decades on, the bay’s pristine waters and crescent-shaped beach still draw fans of the film.
“We did a Phi Phi island boat tour, but we were far from alone,” recalls Gabi Jimenez, an American traveler who visited Thailand earlier this year.
“There must’ve been over 100 boats doing the same multi-stop tour at the same time. Specifically at Maya Bay, what should be a 10-minute stop ended up being over an hour trying to fight through the crowds just to get to the beach and back.”
Nikki Scott, founder and editor of theBackpacker NetworkandSouth East Asia Backpackermagazine, cites three main detrimental effects that come with too many tourists — destruction of the local environment due to construction, negative impacts on nature and resources caused by too many visitors, and the eradication of the local culture to serve tourism demands.
“Unfortunately, there are many places in Asia that are experiencing the impact of overtourism in a variety of ways,” she says.
“The locations most in danger (in Southeast Asia) are islands and beaches.”
She agrees with Gary Bowerman that the Indonesian island of Bali is one of the most glaring examples.
“From plastic pollution to water shortages and terrible traffic jams, Bali is one of the places that is worst hit by overtourism,” she explains.
“Most recently, Bali experienced its worst floods in decades, which many say was partly due to environmental problems created by overtourism. With the eradication of Bali’s rice fields in favor of concrete to build new hotels and villas, the island is experiencing severe drainage problems, which exacerbated the flooding.”
But environmental issues related to tourism have long been simmering in Southeast Asia, even well before the post-Covid boom.
Another paradise island that became a victim of its own popularity was Boracay in the Philippines. Authorities closed the island to tourism forsix months in 2018to reform the tourism scene and give famous spots like Puka Beach a chance to recover from overuse. Authorities closed it again, for two years, during the pandemic.
The Philippine government also placed a cap on Boracay’s tourist arrivals, bolstered environmental protection and outlawed unlicensed accommodation. New Wave Divers dive shop in Boracay reported earlier this year that the measures seem to be working: There are fewer crowds and much cleaner water for diving, snorkeling and swimming.
Thailand has been testing a similar strategy at Maya Bay over the last few years. The national park authority banned tourism for four years and now imposes a two-month closure each year (normally August-September) so the marine and shoreline ecosystems can recover.
But still, officials are struggling to keep a cap on visitors, manyof whom continue todefy the clearly posted rules.
Most of Asia’s major cities have been less impacted by influxes of visitors — Seoul in particular is benefitting from the ongoing K-pop craze — because they have the infrastructure in place to absorb them.
Kyoto, however, isn’t so fortunate. According to Kyoto City officials, a combined total of more than 56 million international and domestic tourists visited the historic city in 2024.
In addition to the tourist experience being lowered, it’s having a negative impact on local life. Residents in this city of around 1.5 million people are especially annoyed by swarms of tourists clogging narrow streets and lanes in the city center and overcrowding public trains and buses, which locals rely on for work and school commutes.
Roughly 90% of the Kyoto residents surveyed by Japan’s Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper complained about overtourism. Besides crowding, one of the biggest grievances was rude or disrespectful behavior by foreign tourists who seem to treat Kyoto like a theme park rather than an old, venerable and very spiritual city.
“Japan’s traditionally conservative national character means there is a sense of disorientation at the loss of balance when one in three people is a foreign tourist,” explains Yusuke Ishiguro, an associate professor at the Graduate School of International Media, Communication, and Tourism Studies at Hokkaido University.
“Unfortunately, Japan’s tourism policies and businesses have traditionally focused on increasing visitor numbers. They are therefore currently in the ‘considering’ phase and actually doing nothing.”
Ishiguro says authorities have introduced closed-circuit cameras to monitor tourist behavior and hotel taxes to reduce economic incentives but adds neither measure has led to a fundamental solution to overtourism in Kyoto and elsewhere.
“The only effective measures,” he says, are physical barriers to control tourist flow and setting capacity limits. “However, these are only achievable in rural areas such as Shirakawa-go and Biei Town, where stakeholder relationships are relatively simple. It is impossible in cities like Kyoto because hotel owners and Airbnb hosts want to fill vacancies every day.”
Still, Kyoto is trying. Last year the city banned tourists from venturing down private lanes in the Gion area and taking unauthorized images after the local geisha complained they were being harassed by photo-seeking foreigners. Violators may face fines of up to 10,000 yen ($65).
Why has Japan set up a task force to deal with foreigners?
Headlines about overtourism in the regionin recent yearssuggest reports of bad tourist behavior are rising as visitor numbers grow.
Bali, for example, has always had a reputation among international travelers for being more liberal and open-minded than it is, says Bowerman.
“It’s actually a very, very spiritual destination. But people go there and behave badly by taking their clothes off for pictures at temples, or riding around without their shirts on motorbikes, not wearing helmets, that kind of thing that goes down very, very badly with locals.”
This struggle to balance tourism-fueled economic growth and the local quality of life is a microcosm of what’s happening throughout Asia.
“We’re in a region where governments, in particular, have singled out or have identified travel and tourism as a pillar of economic growth,” says Bowerman.
“They see tourism as a very, very important platform for attracting investment and for national branding, and that it’s important for the future of the country and also to create opportunities for jobs and revenue.”
Plus, he feels the willpower to confront the issue is often absent.
“You can put laws or regulations in place, but enforcing them is very, very difficult to do. No country wants to be seen to be locking up tourists. It’s just bad PR.”
As for avoiding those crowds? There are plenty of beautiful places in popular countries that aren’t overrun with visitors and require minimal extra effort to visit. And if you do want to visit a notoriously busy place, consider visiting outside of peak travel seasons — that includes domestic holidays.
“Even in popular tourist destinations, it’s easy to find under-explored areas just by wandering away from the trodden path,” suggests Scott.
“Rather than following the crowds or the advice of influencers, strike out in your own direction and see what you find. Talking to locals is also a great way of discovering under-the-radar spots. These unplanned stops and journeys are often the highlights of a traveler’s trip.”

India air travel chaos eases but IndiGo crisis still leaves hundreds stranded,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/asia/indigo-india-air-travel-mumbai-intl-hnk,"Dec 5, 2025, 9:21 PM ET","Crowds at Indian airports eased on Saturday but hundreds of passengers were still gathering outside Bengaluru and Mumbai airports as 385 IndiGo flights were canceled, in the fifth day of a crisis that has hit the country’s biggest airline.
Air travel across India has been in turmoil this week after IndiGo canceled thousands of flights, prompting the government to announce special relief for the carrier and operate some trains to help clear the backlog.
It is the biggest crisis ever for the 20-year-old airline, which long prided itself on on-time performance and lured passengers with low-cost fares.
IndiGo has admitted it failed to plan properly ahead of a November 1 deadline to implement stricter rules for pilots around night flying and weekly rest, which ultimately led to problems around roster planning this week.
On Friday, more than 1,000 IndiGo flights were canceled. The Delhi airport in a post on X said flight operations are steadily resuming, but some IndiGo flights continue to be affected.
Everyone agrees drunk plane passengers are a problem. Nobody agrees on how to fix it
Airport sources told Reuters 124 IndiGo flights in Bengaluru have been canceled on Saturday, 109 in Mumbai, 86 in New Delhi and 66 in Hyderabad.
India’s government has made special relaxations to the rules for the airline, and IndiGo has said it could return to normalcy between December 10-15.
Still, hundreds of passengers gathered outside Bengaluru and Mumbai airports on Saturday, with some clueless about their cancellations, according to Reuters photographers present at the scene.
Satish Konde had to catch a connecting flight to go to the city of Nagpur from Mumbai, and was checked in, but was told later it was canceled.
“I am waiting for my luggage to be returned,” he told Reuters at the airport.
Other major Indian airlines, including Air India and Akasa, have not had to cancel flights due to the new rules."
