"Stocks rally and Dow closes above 47,000 for first time after cooler-than-expected inflation report",https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/investing/us-stock-market,"Oct 24, 2025, 4:07 PM ET","Better-than-expected inflation data Friday morning sparked anend-of-week rally in stocks, sending the Dow, S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soaring to fresh record highs.
The Dow gained 473 points, or 1.01%, and closed at 47,207.12. The blue-chip index closed above 47,000 for the first time ever.
The broader S&P 500 climbed 0.79%. The Nasdaq gained 1.15%. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, sank 5%.
Wall Street sentiment got a boost Friday after Consumer Price Index data for September showed annual inflationheated up in Septemberbut less than expected.
That boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its upcoming policy meetings next week and in December. Fed rate cuts can lower savings and borrowing rates, encouraging spending and investing and boosting business activity, creating a sustained tailwind for the stock market.
Meanwhile, corporate earnings continue to impress Wall Street. Ford shares (F) rose 12% on Friday and had their best day since 2020 after the automaker posted strong third-quarter earnings results.
“When the Fed is lowering rates and earnings are good, markets don’t go down very much,” said Bob Doll, chief executive officer at Crossmark Global Investments. “That’s where we find ourselves.”
“Earnings drive stocks, and earnings have been pretty good,” Doll said.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their best week since early August. The Dow posted its best week since early July.
“With the Fed cutting rates — and this report does nothing to stop them from a [quarter-point] cut next week — and corporate profits continuing to increase, it’s hard to see an interruption of this year’s bull market,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.
Investors next week will be attuned to a slate of corporate earnings from companies including Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). US-China trade will also be in focus as President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping areexpected to meetat the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea."
Why it’s so hard to figure out the economy right now,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/23/politics/economy-tariffs-prices-ai-stock-market-analysis,"Nov 23, 2025, 12:00 PM ET","A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.
The stock market keeps breaking records, but angst about the economy keeps befuddling politicians.
The wealthy are getting wealthier, but everyone else feels somewhat left behind. The executive editor of CNN Business, David Goldman, published an interesting video in which he compared the difficulty of selling $12 burritos with the fact that $230 iPhone socks — yes, they’re a thing — are a hot item.
I talked to Goldman by email about the concept behind this conundrum, that the US economy is shaped like a K. Our conversation is below, along with his video.
WOLF: I was struck by your video about the K-shaped economy. First, can you just explain what that is?
GOLDMAN:You can think of America’s economy as basically split in two. If you make a lot of money, you probably are wondering what all the fuss is about: Your 401(k) is doing great this year, you have a paycheck that may be outpacing inflation, and you can afford to spend on stuff you don’t necessarily need.
If you’re not in that category — and a growing number of Americans aren’t — you hate this economy. You never adjusted to the price shock of 2022, and inflation has stubbornly raised prices since then (even if they’re more under control than they were under Biden). You’re probably borrowing money to pay for necessities, and you may be increasingly late on your debt payments.
So if you’re at the top of the K, you’re the reason why all the economic data still looks good, overall. If you’re at the bottom of the K, you’re the reason why all the polling data suggests President Donald Trump’s support on the economyhas effectively vanished.
WOLF:I think you could apply that same K shape to the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the signature law, so far, of Trump 2.0. Among many other things, it tries to pay for tax cuts that predominantly benefit higher-income Americans with controls on Medicaid and SNAP benefits that affect the lowest-income Americans. Point being: Has the US always had a K-shaped economy?
GOLDMAN: Yes, but it’s getting worse.
The K-shaped economy has been a growing problem for decades, made worse by the loss of guaranteed worker pensions, the rise of the gig economy, increasinghealth-care inflation, the high cost of college, the lack of affordable housing… We’ve all heard the story, and we know it because we’re living it.
Actually, the one exception — when lower-income workers gained ground against high-income workers — was during the few years that followed the pandemic. Government support gave working-class folks a leg up, and, for the first time in a generation, the wealth gap narrowed. Oh, and mortgage rates were dirt cheap, which let homeowners refinance like crazy to make their mortgage payments as low as possible.
But it didn’t last. The stimulus-check sugar rush wore off, and the economy kind of resumed its previous trajectory.
Now the gap in the K is accelerating: Mortgage rates are near multi-decade highs, Trump iscutting safety-net programsand increasing hurdles toaccess support.
On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that inflation-adjusted hourly pay fell 0.1% between August and September for people who aren’t in managerial roles (i.e., low-income folks). That means that their real pay got a little smaller in the summer, because higher prices ate into their earnings. Meanwhile, real earnings for higher-paid positions gained, even when accounting for inflation. So the wealth gap is widening.
You can see that inWalmart’s earnings this past week: The fastest-growing customer segment for Walmart is middle-income folks who make more than $100,000. So the middle-class is starting to penny-pinch, too.
WOLF: The K-shaped economy concept fits with another term that is currently dominant in the political conversation: affordability. In hindsight, affordability may have sunk Democrats in 2024. It’s the issue that, at the moment, is doing real damage to Trump. What distinguishes the affordability issue today from the inequality issue that was very much in the news a few years ago?
GOLDMAN: I think they’re two sides of the same coin. If the economy is working for you, you’re not super concerned about affordability. You might grimace when you pay $5 for something that cost $3 a couple years ago, but $2 isn’t breaking the bank. If the economy is leaving you behind, you may stop buying that thing altogether — or go into debt to pay for it.
If you watched my K-shaped economy video, there’s a reason I used the $230 iPhone “sock” and the $12 Chipotle burrito as examples. The iPhone sock has been ridiculed because of the price — but it’s completely sold out. For people who can afford it, they perceived value in a trendy designer item. But Chipotle’s CEO last month said the company is really struggling with customers who make $100,000 a year or less, because they don’t think a $12 burrito bowl is better value than buying food at the grocery store.
WOLF: Polling suggests Americans don’t think President Trump has done enough on affordability. What do the numbers say? Is there any proof yet that his tariffs are driving up costs?
GOLDMAN:There’s not a ton of evidence yet that Trump’s tariffs are raising prices broadly. Inflation is at 3% annually — the same as when Trump took office (although it fell close to 2% in the first few months after he took office and then started rising again).
There hasn’t been a CPI inflation report since the shutdown started, so the data’s a little stale … and Trump didn’t really put his tariffs in place widely until August. But you see prices rising in certain items like furniture (up 6% over the past 12 months through September) and Swiss watches (up 6.6%) that we just don’t make here. You see it in tropical fruits like bananas (up 7%) and coffee (up 19%), which is why the administration reversed course and cut tariffs on produce we don’t grow here.
The right-leaning Tax Foundation estimates that the average American household will pay $1,200 more this year than last year because of Trump’s tariffs — so, like $100 a month. But Trump also cut taxes, so for some folks in higher income brackets, that’ll even out some.
Still, JPMorgan had an interesting report last month that suggested businesses are eating about 80% of the tariff costs right now — but there’s evidence that they can’t keep taking that on, as profit margins get thinner … so they’re about to start passing that onto consumers.
By this time next year, JPMorgan economists said they wouldn’t be surprised if that was flipped — so you’ll be paying 80% and businesses will be shouldering just 20%. Ouch. The Tax Foundation agrees and said next year your tariff costs on average will be $1,600 per household.
WOLF: Is there anything more that Trump could be doing on housing?
GOLDMAN:Housing is such a tricky one. … Trump’s housing ideas are pretty wacky, especially the50-year mortgagethat basically everyone across the political spectrum hated. The portable mortgages (where you take your mortgage with you when you buy a new house) or assumable mortgages (where you take on the seller’s mortgage) are interesting ideas but super complex, and experts told us that it could break the underlying market that effectively makes the entire mortgage system work in the first place. Not fun.
The real problem is that we stopped building homes in this country during the financial crisis, which was exacerbated by a housing crash. Supply hasn’t kept up with demand, and if you took Econ 101, you know that means prices rise. And there’s just not much that Trump or anyone in the federal government can do about that. He’s talked about opening up federal lands, but … those aren’t places people want to live.
State and local governments are increasingly serious about taking on this issue. You had thataffordable housing interview about New York Citya couple weeks ago, so you know each location’s housing issues are unique. The advocate you interviewed said New York is focused on cutting red tape, but I’m skeptical of his argument that New York has plenty of room to build. It’s true that there are low-density areas of the city, but they tend to be far from accessible public transportation. I hope he’s right — it’s insanely expensive to live here!
California is doing some really interesting — if controversial — experimentation with zoning laws that could help ease the housing affordability crisis. But NIMBYism is real, and there’s no quick or easy fix.
WOLF:One story that has not gotten enough attention during Trump 2.0 is the stakes the US government is taking in private companies like Intel and others. What’s your take on it? Necessary to maintain US dominance or a nationalist hazard to capitalism?
GOLDMAN:I mean,we just did a storyon how those stocks that Trump invested taxpayers’ money in are outperforming the S&P 500 by a pretty wide margin. So … I guess I’m pro? For now at least? Haha.
The risk is, of course, that this all comes crashing down in some kind of AI bubble burst that could make put those investments under water. There’s no sense that we’re in danger of that happening imminently, but certainly the market is growing concerned that AI may be overvalued.
It’s pretty extraordinary for the government to become an investor in companies of this magnitude. I mean, webailed out Chrysler and GM 16 years ago, but that was an emergency event during the biggest recession since the Great Depression, so that’s very different from the situation we’re in right now. Nvidia is a $5 trillion company, America is clearly leading the way. … I’m not sure there’s a real argument that this kind of investment is necessary to maintain America’s dominance.
With that said, for projects of massive scale, like NASA, public-private partnerships work extremely well. AI may eventually be on that kind of scale, and it really is a national security concern to the United States if China takes the lead on this potentially earth-shattering technology.
I don’t know about the nationalist hazard to capitalism. … I’ve heard the argument, but “picking winners and losers” sounds like more of a talking point than a real concern. Intel was a deeply troubled company before America took an investment in it, and I’m not sure $10 billion is going to return it to dominance. I think Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom are right to be annoyed but they’re going to be just fine.
WOLF: There have been a lot of stories recently about an AI bubble that’s keeping the stock market in record territory. What does that mean for Americans who are the market (and by that I mean pretty much everyone with a 401k)?
GOLDMAN:Yeah, remember the dot-com bust that led to a mini-recession in the early 2000s? That’s what could happen if this thing goes south. The eight most valuable companies on the market are all worth north of $1 trillion and they’re all AI companies. Nvidia, the granddaddy of all AI companies, makes up 8% of the S&P 500. So you have a lot riding on AI, even if you’re a buy-and-hold index fund kind of investor.
But I don’t buy that we’re in for a crash any time soon. There is a stupid amount of money floating around, but it’s not phony baloney money — it’s backed up by legit banks and not smoke and mirrors like during the dot-com bust. There are no Pets.coms out there that I can see — and a lot of potential Amazons.
With that said, are we in an AI bubble? Almost certainly. Is it about to pop? I have no idea. This still could be early days. It’s notoriously difficult to know what stage of a bubble we’re in until it bursts.
WOLF:﻿Ourrecent story about Nvidia, the $5 trillion company, included the term “circular funding deals.” Is that a new thing in the AI era? Is it something that is concerning to people who pay a lot of attention to the economy as a whole?
GOLDMAN:Basically, everyone is in bed with one another. Can I say that on this podcast? This is a podcast, right?
Yeah, this is the craziest part of all this. There are chipmakers, database companies, server farms, cloud providers and application builders, and it seems like all of them are invested in one another. It’s smart, I suppose, to spread the risk. But it also means everyone is basically exposed to the same potential fallout if one of these companies goes down.
The reason they’re doing it is because there is so much demand for AI chips, so much demand for server capacity, so much demand for power. … It’s just not possible to say “we choose you, exclusively” and remain competitive.
WOLF: We’re behind on economic data because of the shutdown. What are the most important year-end reports and indicators you’ll be looking at for the strength of the economy this year?
GOLDMAN:Jobs and inflation are the big ones for me. We got some mixed news in the September jobs report — the unemployment rate rose higher than expected, but so did the number of jobs created. We have no idea what’s going on with prices. We’ll find out soon."
Consumer spending stalled in September as inflation remained stubborn,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/economy/us-pce-consumer-spending-inflation-september,"Dec 5, 2025, 10:09 AM ET","The last piece of official inflation data to land before the Federal Reserve’s policymaking meeting next week was a shutdown-delayed report that showed the pace of price hikes remained stubborn in September and consumer spending waned after a summer splurge.
The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — the inflation gauge the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% target rate — rose 0.3% on a monthly basis, which lifted annual inflationfrom 2.7%to 2.8% in September, a rate last hit in April 2024, according to data released Friday by the Commerce Department.
Gas prices were on the high side in September, helping drive up overall inflation. Food prices also rose for the second month in a row.
However, energy and food prices can be quite volatile (and influenced by one-time factors), so the Fed also closely watches the core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, as a way to gauge underlying inflation trends.
The core PCE index rose 0.2% from the month before, which slowed the annual rate to 2.8% from 2.9%.
Friday’s data came in largely as anticipated: Economists were expecting inflation to rise 0.2% from August and tick higher to 2.8%, according to FactSet.
Sticky, stubbornly high inflation running at a 2.8% rate is still above the Fed’s 2% target; however, it remains likely that the central bank willmake another quarter-point cut at its policy meeting next week, said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet.
But, at this stage, the other side of the Fed’s price stability and full employment mandate warrants more monetary policy attention as the labor market continues to cool, she said.
Friday’s data is “certainly not going to stop them from cutting,” she said of central bank officials. “I think it’d be different if we saw inflation accelerating and picking up.”
Friday’s report was originally scheduled for release on Halloween; however, the federal government’s historic shutdown (which lasted the entirety of October and a dozen days into November), delayed the collection, tabulation and dissemination of a host of critical economic data.
Although seemingly stale, Friday’s data is the most comprehensive monthly report on pricing trends and how US households are earning, spending and saving.
Americans also reined in their purchases somewhat in September. Spending rose 0.3% that month after ticking up by 0.5% during each of the three previous months.
When taking inflation into account, spending was flat in September, the lowest monthly reading since real spending dipped 0.1% in May (when car sales slumped after a spring buying frenzyfueled by tariff fears).
The fundamentals supporting consumer spending weakened in September as well, Friday’s report showed: Inflation-adjusted disposable income rose just 0.1% for the month.
“A silent majority of consumers is increasingly strained by a two-year affordability crisis and elevated borrowing costs,” Gregory Daco, EY-Parthenon’s chief economist, wrote in a note on Friday. “Slower income growth is pushing many upper-median, median- and lower-income families to draw down savings and rely more heavily on credit to sustain their habits.”
While trading down has become the norm for many households, a lot of the spending activity – particularly on services and discretionary areas – is being driven by higher-income individuals, he said, referencing what’s been deemed a“K-shaped economy.”
Thehigher cost of living, after years of elevated inflation, continues to weigh heavily on Americans. Consumer sentiment has slumped amid the persistently high price environment as well as high levels of uncertainty related to steep tariffs and other sweeping actions from the Trump administration.
A separate report released Friday showed that consumer sentiment in early December rose 2.3 points to a preliminary reading of 53.3, according to the University of Michigan’s latest survey.
That was a bigger increase than economists had expected and showed that Americans saw “modest improvementsfrom Novemberon a few dimensions,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a release.
Still, sentiment remains historically weak, near record lows, and “consumers continue to cite the burden of high prices,” Hsu said.
The holidays and the promise of a new year tend to bolster Americans’ feelings about the economy and what lies ahead, NerdWallet’s Renter told CNN.
“I think people are optimistic and more willing to spend over the holidays and perhaps buck any negative sentiment they might be feeling at the time,” she said.
However, considering that the holidays can spur some irrational spending patterns, there does remain some concern about consumers’ financial health moving forward, she said.
“If they’re just amassing credit card debt and then getting behind on their payments, spending might not be all that great for the consumer,” she said.

An unusual trend in the economy is worrying the Fed,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/23/economy/jobless-boom-ai-federal-reserve,"Nov 23, 2025, 4:00 AM ET","Something in the US economy isn’t adding up, and it’s rattling the people charged with wrangling inflation and keeping the labor market intact.
US companies havesharply slowed their hiring this year, hesitant to invest without knowing the full effects of President Donald Trump’s sweeping economic policies. The economy lost jobs in June and August, and the average pace of job gains for the three months ending in September was only around 62,000, according to the Labor Department.
Yet workers’ productivity, a key driver of economic output, remains high. And gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy, has stayed robust.
That dichotomy of an expanding economy and a softening labor market presents a conundrum for policymakers at the Federal Reserve,complicating their effortsto determine whether the economy needs cooling or boosting.
“The divergence between solid economic growth and weak job creation created a particularly challenging environment for policy decisions,” Fed officials noted in their October meeting, according to minutes released Thursday.
A growing economy, boosted by resilient consumers and massive investments in AI, should be spurring hiring, especially now that the Fed has started lowering borrowing costs. But that hasn’t happened, and there are fears it won’t.
“When it comes to monetary policy, the narrative next year is going to be about how to handle a jobless expansion,” Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, told CNN. “How do you try to get businesses to hire more?”
The recent string ofrecord highsin the stock market suggests that many American businesses are optimistic about the value of AI. However, that confidence has so far not translated into an expansion of their workforce.
Business spending on information processing equipment and software accounted for 4.4% of GDP in the second quarter, according to Commerce Department data, slightly below a peak reached in 2000 when businesses ramped up similar investments during the dot-com boom. Solid consumer spending this year has also kept company profits afloat.
US adds jobs, but unemployment hits 4-year high
“Firms are investing a lot in this new technology, but sometimes that means reducing other expenditures, such as hiring,” said Eugenio Alemán, chief economist at Raymond James. He added that strong AI investment likely persisted in the third quarter and should peak sometime next year.
The government shutdown likely dented GDP in the current quarter that stretches from October through December, but the US economy is widely expected to recoup most of those losses early next year.
Meanwhile, the US labor market has been stymied by Trump’s significant policy changes since the beginning of the year.
“It’s been a challenging year for employment precisely because of the changes in trade and immigration policy affecting both labor supply and demand,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at DA Davidson.
It’s unclear whether rate cuts can eventually counteract the corrosive effects of major policy changes that have stoked uncertainty to bolster hiring, economists say.
“Fortunately, we’re not seeing a lot of layoffs, because that’s how you turn a jobless expansion into a recession,” Sweet said. “The economy can grow without creating a lot of jobs, but productivity growth has to be decent.”
Fed officials are expected to deliver a few more rate cuts through 2026, according to their latest economic projections from September.
A jobless expansion could quickly translate into a recession.
“You’re very vulnerable to anything that goes wrong,” Sweet said. “The labor market is your line of defense, and if that starts to fray, then it’s game over.”
It also raises the risk the Fed commits a policy mistake.
In a speech last month, Fed Governor Christopher Waller described the divergence between GDP and job growth as a “conflict” that should work itself out — for better or worse.
Wait, I thought the economy was terrible. What happened?
“Something’s gotta give — either economic growth softens to match a soft labor market, or the labor market rebounds to match stronger economic growth,” he said.
And if job growth remains inconsistent with GDP, that puts the US economy in a precarious position.
Persistently strong economic growth also makes Fed officials less confident that they should be lowering interest rates, and there’s already plenty of hesitance to continue with rate cuts within the central bank’s rate-setting committee.
“With two rate cuts now in place, I’d find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly,” Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said Friday at an event in Zurich, adding that there are signs that “policy most likely isn’t very restrictive.”"
Why does the stock market care so much about a rate cut?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/business/us-stock-market-federal-reserve-rate-decision,"Dec 9, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","Just a few weeks ago, the stock market stumbled over fears that artificial intelligence stocks might be in abubble. Now stocks are back within reach of a record high.
Thank the Federal Reserve.
The market has rebounded from a dip in early November as investors have leaned into bets that the Fed will cut interest rates this week at its last policy meeting of the year.
Interest-rate cuts can boost stocks by lowering savings rates and borrowing costs for individuals and businesses, in turn encouraging spending and investing, spurring business activity and increasing corporate earnings.
Fed rate cuts can also lower the yield on short-term government bonds and cash equivalents like money market funds, making higher-yielding assets like stocks more attractive to investors.
All told, interest-rate cuts can create a strong tailwind for stocks.
Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG, said in a Monday note that the stock market’s recent rise has coincided with increasing odds for a Fed rate cut in December.
Traders on Monday were pricing in an 89% chance the Fed cuts rates, according to CME FedWatch.
“Markets have essentially seen a complete reversal of November’s weakness,” Krinsky said. “This has coincided almost in lock-step with rate-cut odds for the upcoming December (Fed) meeting.”
The Fed is cutting rates in response to concerns about a weakening labor market. But for investors, lower rates can provide fuel for stocks to rally.
The Fed’s benchmark interest rate influences a range of interest rates across the economy. A Fed rate cut can lead to lower financing costs for a broad range of companies.
The Russell 2000, a market index of smaller companies that are more rate-sensitive, hit a record high on December 4.
“When you look at the firms that are more vulnerable and are smaller, like those in the Russell 2000, when you have lower rates, their interest expenses drop heavily, and that widens their profit margins,” said José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers. “That’s really why areas like real estate, manufacturing and small businesses benefit a lot more from lower rates.”
To be sure, while investors have embraced hopes for a rate cut this week, Wall Street is always forward-looking, and there is less certainty about the path of rate cuts in January.
The Fed on Wednesday will release its quarterly summary of economic projections, which lays out — anonymously — officials’ expectations for the course of interest rates across the coming months.
“As the (Fed) considers additional rate cuts at its meeting this week and into 2026, reaccelerating inflation would likely force a slower, more cautious path,” Jayson Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, said in a note."
Why are stocks setting records when the economy feels down in the dumps?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/15/business/stock-market-dow-record-economy-jobs-inflation,"Sep 15, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","Hiring is at astandstill. Inflation ison the rise again. Consumer sentiment isslipping near historic lows. Americans areincreasingly fed upwith the economy.
Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has hit four record highs this month. The Dow closed above 46,000 for the first time in history on Thursday. So, if theeconomy stinks, why is the stock market so delighted?
In some ways, stocks are trading at record highsbecauseof thebad juju in America’s economy, not in spite of it.
Asurprisingly weak job markethas significantly boosted investors’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates multiple times this year, according toCME FedWatch, a tool that assigns probabilities of Fed rate decisions to market machinations. The market is pricing in an 80% chance of a December rate cut, an 86% chance of an October cut and a 100% chance that the Fed cuts rates at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.
The market has been eager for lower borrowing costs – the Fed hasn’t cut rates at all in 2025 after slashing rates by a percentage point across three meetings at the end of last year. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has saiduncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariff policyhas given the voting committee pause. Inflation has crept higher over the past several months in part because tariffs are – slowly –starting to boost prices. Rate cuts could exacerbate inflation.
Wall Street loves rate cuts, because they can help boost businesses’ profits by lowering costs for loans. That gives more perceived underlying value to the companies’ stocks, and it can give employers extra cash to hire. That’s why rate cuts tend to boost the economy over time.
Stock investors have also cheered some long-awaited strength in the bond market, which has suddenly gained steam because of intensifying fears about a slowdown in job growth. The safe-haven US Treasury market has been on fire in recent days as traders have been pricing in Fed rate cuts, which tend to drive yields lower and prices higher (prices and yields trade in opposite directions). The 2-year Treasury yield is trading near its lowest level since the 2022 inflation crisis, and the 10-year Treasury yield is flirting with 4% for the first time since April’s tariff-fueled meltdown.
Lower bond yields also help businesses spend less on their debt, adding potential value to their stocks.
The S&P 500, the benchmark for the stock market, has gained 6% since theshocking August 1 jobs reportshowed hiring slowed down significantly and the US economy had actually created a quarter million fewer jobs over the previous two months than previously believed. The market has been on a particular tear in September in the leadup to the Fed meeting, as more moribund jobs data poured in – the S&P 500 has posted gains in six of nine sessions this month.
So bad news about the economy has certainly been good news for stocks in recent months.
But that’s not the full story.
Although the Fed has undoubtedly boosted optimism that the already-historically expensive stock market still has room to run, strength in company earnings have helped give traders confidence, too: Wall Street’s profit and sales growth expectations remain rock-solid.
And, after all, the stock market is really just a collection of individual companies whose prices move up or down based on their perceived value. If investors didn’t have faith that the companies that they trade would make them money, they probably wouldn’t value the stocks so highly.
The artificial intelligence industry’s electric growth has also been fueling the market’s rise. Nine of the 10 most valuable stocks on the market are deeply involved in AI, and they collectively make up about 40% of the entire value of the stock market.
To give a sense of how much enthusiasm the market has for AI,Oracle’s stock shot 36% higherin a single day last week, after a stellar forecast for AI-fueled datacenter demand. That briefly made cofounder Larry Ellison the world’s richest person (though he finished Wednesday $1 billion poorer than Elon Musk), and it propelled Oracle (ORCL) into the top-10 list of most valuable companies on the market.
And stocks have gained ground after Trump’s tariffs went into effect in early August, giving businesses a bit of certainty after months of on-again, off-again trade threats that prevented companies from making informed decisions about their investments. The tax benefits delivered in Trump’s signature “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” also helped give companies some additional support to their bottom lines – and it gives investors confidence that the massive fluctuations in White House policy maneuvers have settled down and they can therefore take on some more risk in their portfolios.
Meanwhile, consumers have continued to spend, despite tariffs and growing concerns about the economy. Spending rose 0.5% in July, theCommerce Department reportedtwo weeks ago. That’s crucial: Consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of US gross domestic product, the broadest measure of America’s economy.
“It’s not just the Fed,” said Citi Research analyst Scott Chronert in a note to investors on Friday. “Earnings expectations continue to be strong while rate volatility and levels falls. Combined, this is a powerful narrative for risk assets.”
But there’s still reason for concern.
Stocks are historically pricey: The S&P 500 is trading at 3.3 times the value of its constituents’ sales expectations, thehighest on record. It’s also at a historically high price-to-earnings ratio of 25 to 1; that means for a company to earn $1 in future earnings, investors are willing to pay $25 in share price. That means investors may be getting a bit ahead of themselves.
Price increases may start to weigh on consumer spending, eroding the case for companies’ sales growth. Inflation this year has added $195 a month in costs for a typical American household, according to Moody’s Chief Economist Mark Zandi.
As costs start to rise, consumers have been adding to their already massive debt loads, which could become a problem. Debt delinquencies are on the rise, accelerating because of student loan debt payments restarting in October 2024, according to Dana Telsey, CEO and chief research officer of Telsey Advisory Group. Student loan repayments will suck $80 billion out of the economy this year, Brookings said last week.
Inflation, though not at runaway levels like in 2022, is becoming such a concern that a traditional inflation hedge is setting new records: gold. Trading at nearly $3,700,gold has gained about 40% this yearand recently eclipsed its inflation-adjusted record-high set 45 years ago. Traders worried about inflation tend to pour money in gold, which some believe holds an intrinsic value that hedges against rising prices.
Gary Friedman, CEO of RH (formerly Restoration Hardware), made the case Thursday on a call with Wall Street analysts that tariffs and inflation pose a more significant threat to businesses than most people realize – so he’s not all that excited about a rate cut from the Fed.
“What do I worry the most about? Just kill inflation. I’m more motivated about killing inflation than getting an interest rate cut right now, because we had an interest rate cut and the tariffs create more inflation than anybody thinks,” Friedman said. “I don’t want to win because 50% of our competitors who are really good, hard working people, get wiped out.”
“I really don’t think anybody is thinking about the math,” he added.

Why markets are suddenly on edge,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/14/investing/us-stock-market,"Nov 14, 2025, 8:20 AM ET","For months, it felt like nothing could knock stocks off their steady ascent — but November has been a rough month on Wall Street.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down almost 3.5% this month and on track for its first losing month since March. The Nasdaq has shed roughly $1.74 trillion in market value in two weeks as investors have dumped tech stocks.
Stocks opened sharply lower Friday before bouncing off their lows as investors bought the dip. The major indexes wavered into the closing bell. The Nasdaq turned positive and closed higher by 0.13% after briefly falling almost 1.9%. The S&P 500 fluctuated and closed lower by 0.05%. The Dow fell 310 points, or 0.65%.
“Stocks were set for another horrific session at the open following yesterday’s debacle but investors saw the sharp dip as an opportunity to accumulate shares,” said José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.
The benchmark S&P 500 is still down 1.55% this month while the Dow is down 0.87%. The S&P 500 has shed more than $1.3 trillion in market value in just over two weeks as it has retreated from a record high set in late October.
After months of gains, investors have outsized expectations, making them easer to disappoint. Tech stocks have becomerelatively pricey.
And after the government shutdown halted official data releases for weeks, investors are unsure what the new figures,as government releases resume,will show about the state of the world’s biggest economy. That, in turn, is stoking uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates in December, and adding to the Wall Street jitters.
The government is back open. Here’s what that means for economic data
“When the government was shut down, we could believe whatever we wanted to believe,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN’s Matt Egan. “Now we need to be data dependent, and that may not be as much fun.”
Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence carried the market to new record highs this year. But now some investors are hitting pause, taking profits and reassessing whether those stocks will continue to produce superior returns.
“With lofty valuations in AI-related stocks, it’s understandable that investors are on edge about anything that might go wrong,” Yardeni wrote in a Thursday note.
Bitcoin, which can serve as a gauge of how risk-on investors are feeling, slid 4% on Friday and hovered around $94,500. The cryptocurrency has tumbled 25% since it hit a record high in early October.
Wall Street and the Fed are awaiting a deluge of economic data that was delayed due to the shutdown.
That is contributing to mounting nerves about the Fed’s next move. Traders on Friday were pricing a 46% chance the central bank will cut rates in December, down from a 96% chance one month ago.
At the last policy meeting, in October, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cast some doubt on whether the Fed would cut rates again this year. Fed officials — including Boston Fed President Susan Collins, who is a voter on policy moves this year — delivered remarks this week that have shown hesitancy to continue cutting rates.
While Evercore ISI analysts in a note said they still see an interest rate cut next month, they think it’s “very hard to call” because of a combination of factors, including “data blindness.”
The central bank’s rate cuts in September and October boosted stocks, and a pause on rate cuts could pose troubles for stocks that have rallied on expectations for lower borrowing costs — in particular, the AI and tech stocks that have propelled the market higher.
“Extreme fear” was the sentiment driving markets on Friday, according toCNN’s Fear and Greed index.
But some investors say a pullback in stocks can also be healthy.
The Nasdaq gained every month from April through the end of October. Now, the market is resetting as investors reassess the outlook.
“This (pullback) is somewhat overdue, and I don’t think it’s the start of acorrection,” Yardeni said.
There is also increasing skepticism about whether Big Tech companies can make enough money to justify the enormous spending taking place on AI deals now.
“The technology sector has faced selling pressure in recent weeks amid concerns over rising debt issuance and a surge in capital expenditures” like new data centers, Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist, told CNN’s Matt Egan in an email. “Investors are questioning whether these investments will translate into future profitability.”
Oracle shares (ORCL) surged 36% in one day on September 10 after the company announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Shares in Oracle have tumbled since then, erasing those gains.
“Companies announcing large supply deals with OpenAI have similarly been met with skepticism around OpenAI’s ability to deliver on its financial objectives,” John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in an email.
It’s not just Oracle facing pressure. Meta shares (META) are down 23% since hitting a record high in mid-August. Nvidia shares (NVDA) are down 10% since hitting a record high in late October. Palantir shares (PLTR) are down 16% since hitting a record high on November 3.
“What’s happened recently in the market isn’t even close to a tech wreck, but it may be a bit of a tech reckoning,” said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team.
To Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, this month has been defined by investors rotating out of tech stocks and into other sectors.
The recent pullback, he said, feels like “investors trying to protect profits after a really healthy run off the lows in April.”"
AI is about to face an enormous test. The market is already nervous,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/19/markets/nvidia-us-stock-market,"Nov 19, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market’srecent bout of volatility. So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday.
The stock market rally —﻿that had been going practically nonstop since April until this month’s blip — largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years.
Investors are now eager to know whether demand for Nvidia’s chips — and its optimism about the future — are continuing to grow or if there are signs of AI fatigue.
Earnings this month from tech company Palantir (PLTR), which uses AI for its government contracts, beat Wall Street’s estimates. However, concerns about the stock’s expensive valuation and nerves about a bubble gave investors pause — and fueled asell-off in AI stocksover the past several weeks. Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) has fallen more than 8% this month, although it’s still up 37% this year.
“The market for the first time is questioning whether the hype will turn into reality,” Bob Elliott, CIO at asset management firm Unlimited Funds, told CNN.
Nvidia’s chips power part of practically every major AI venture, meaning investors will scrutinize its earnings as well as chief executive Jensen Huang’s remarks.
“Nvidia takes on even greater weight than normal,” Elliott said. “If it doesn’t confirm high expectations built into the market, then watch out below.”
Every investor should care about Nvidia’s earnings this afternoon: Nvidia accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. That means investors — and those with 401(k)s — are increasingly exposed to the company’s strong gains. Similarly, they are more exposed to a drop in Nvidia’s stock price.
As of Tuesday, Nvidia shares’ gains have accounted for 18% of the S&P 500’s total return this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Since Nvidia last reported earnings in August, concerns have been rising aboutcircular financing, with tech companies entwined in a massive web of extraordinarily lucrative deals.
Now nerves are fraying about whether the money being poured into the AI boom will be justified. On top of that, tech stocks have become relatively expensive.
“Nvidia’s earnings on Wednesday are particularly important given the rising skepticism regarding the longevity of the AI cycle and current AI stock valuations,” James Demmert,CIO at Main Street Research, said in an email. “Anything less than a stellar report and outlook could make stock indexes vulnerable.”
And it’s bigger than just Wall Street. There are concerns that the AI boom — which has helped boost US economic growth this year — is now masking signs of weakness in the economy.
At its market value of $4.4 trillion, Nvidia is currently larger than every country’s economy except the United States, China and Germany.
Nvidia’s fate is interlinked with other big tech companies that depend on its products. A sign of a slowdown in demand could signal that the other tech companies are less confident about the AI buildout.
Some Wall Street analysts are optimistic that Nvidia will continue to deliver impressive earnings. AI chatbots like ChatGPT — and the data centers powering AI — depend on the company’s chips. It’s the foundation of the current AI wave.
“That is why everyone listens to every word that Jensen Huang has to say, because it’s a good gauge of the health of the AI ecosystem,” said Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research.

Stocks and bitcoin slide as nerves fray ahead of Nvidia earnings,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/investing/us-stock-market,"Nov 17, 2025, 2:50 PM ET","Wall Street kicked off the week on a sour note, with stocks and bitcoin tumbling as a risk-off attitude spread through markets.
The Dow closed lower by 557 points, or 1.18%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.92%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.84%.
Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 13%.CNN’s Fear and Greed indextraded in “extreme fear” and hit its lowest level since early April.
Stocks fell on Monday as investors’ nerves intensified ahead of two key events this week: Nvidia (NVDA), the star of the artificial intelligence boom, is set to report earnings on Wednesday. And on Thursday, the September jobs report — long delayed because of the government shutdown — is set to be released.
These two events will provide more insight about the issues that are “top of mind” for Wall Street, according to José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.
Tech stocks havecome under pressurethis month as concerns linger about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 5.5% since hitting a record high in late October.
Investors are trying to discern whether the AI trade is on stable foundations, and whether the Federal Reserve will pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting in December.
Meanwhile, bitcoin plunged on Monday to below $90,000 for the first time in seven mon﻿ths, erasing its gains for this year. The cryptocurrency has tanked more than 28% in just six weeks after it hit a record high above $126,000 in early October.
Tech and crypto-related stocks led the S&P 500 lower on Monday. Coinbase (COIN), a crypto exchange, fell 7%.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Monday dipped below their 50-day moving averages, according to FactSet. The 50-day moving average is a key threshold of support.
“While the long-term uptrend is intact, we believe a corrective pullback/consolidation phase is already underway after the market’s six-month winning streak,” Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said in a note.
Why markets are suddenly on edge
Stocks are coming off avolatile week. Tech stocks took a bruising last week before investors swooped in on Friday to buy the dip.
Investors this week are gearing up for a potential market-moving event with Nvidia’s earnings. The chipmaker accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500’s market value. Nvidia shares fell 1.83% on Monday, weighing on the broader market.
“The monthly jobs report would normally dominate this week’s economic calendar, but with the AI trade struggling the past couple of weeks, Nvidia’s earnings are once again looking like a key piece of the market’s momentum puzzle,” Chris Larkin, managing director at Morgan Stanley’s E-Trade, said in an email.
The recent stock market rally is also being tested as investors adjust to the prospect that the Fed might pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting next month. Traders are pricing in a 45% chance that the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 94% chance one month ago.
Stocks have rallied on optimism about Fed rate cuts. Nerves are mounting that the central bank may prioritize concerns about stubborn inflation.
“Data releases starting this week should provide a clearer picture for one of the key risks over the coming weeks — the December Fed meeting,” Mohit Kumar, chief strategist and economist for Europe at Jefferies, said in a note.
Investors this month have also rotated out of high-flying tech stocks and moved into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.
“This rotation is both expected and welcome, as it should unwind some of the frothiness … and allow this bull market the opportunity to catch its breath before resuming its advance,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said in a note.

Trump’s undeniable stock market victory that no one saw coming,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/markets/us-stock-market,"Nov 4, 2025, 6:30 AM ET","One year after President Donald Trump’s reelection, the US stock market continues to notchrecord highs.
The S&P 500 has gained 19.6% over the past 12 months, boosted by strong corporate earnings and investors’ enthusiasm about artificial intelligence. Stocks have been remarkably adaptable, defying concerns about a resurgence in global trade tensions and bouts of intense volatility.
To Trump, the market’s gains are a vindication of his policies. The president on October 28 touted stocks’ record highs during a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.
“Their stock market today and our stock market today hit an all-time high,” Trumpsaid. “That means we’re doing something right.”
But some analysts say the stock market’s gains have a more prosaic reason: Corporate earnings continue to impress Wall Street, and investors are betting big on AI.
“What happens in Washington matters, but it’s not the only thing that matters,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist. “Despite all the shifting narratives, the key theme for this year is the dominance of tech and AI and the continued resilience of corporate America.”
The stock market’s resilience has been surprising, said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management, considering Trump’s “pretty aggressive changes and approaches” to US trade policy and the Federal Reserve, which he has pressured to lower interest rates.
“Trump’s introduced a lot of uncertainty into markets over the last year,” Ellerbroek said. “The market hates uncertainty.”
Investors have turned their attention to the AI trade and tried to look past concerns about tariffs, he said.
“This AI investment cycle is humongous and unprecedented and overwhelming any and all of those things,” Ellerbroek said.
The S&P 500, which is weighted by market value, has become increasingly concentrated in big tech companies. Nvidia (NVDA), which just hit$5 trillionin market value, now accounts for 8% of the S&P 500’s market value.
An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500, which gives all the companies in the index an equal part, is up just 6% over the past 12 months, compared to the benchmark index’s 19.6% gain.
The S&P 500 fell as much as 19% in April as Trump rolled out hisplan for tariffs. But as markets tumbled, the Trump administration walked back its most severe proposals.
Since then, the S&P 500 has coasted higher. The index is up six months in a row.
“Stocks may be higher in part because the administration’s final tariff actions were ultimately less severe than initially feared,” said Mark Malek, CIO at brokerage firm Siebert Financial. “Were it not for the tariff-driven swoon earlier this year, markets would likely be even higher today.”
From Trump’s election through the end of October, the S&P 500’s rise was the eighth best for a president’s first year since the end of World War II, according to CFRA Research data. The S&P 500 climbed roughly 38% during the same period during President Joe Biden’s term, marking the best performance on record.
Meanwhile, the US stock market’s gains this year pale in comparison to global markets. In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi index has soared 66% across the past 12 months. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has gained 28%. Benchmark stock indexes in Poland and Greece have gained roughly 52% and 60%, respectively.
The US stock market’s rollercoaster ride since Trump took office
While stocks are near record highs, the Treasury market has also advanced. Despite concerns about US deficits, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and attacks on the Fed’s independence, investors have still flocked to US government bonds.
The 10-year US Treasury yield, which influences a host of interest rates across the economy, has declined from 4.4% in November 2024 to 4.1% this month.
Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, has signaled relative calm in markets for the majority of the past six months. An index tracking volatility in the bond market is hovering near its lowest level this year.
“We want the most America-first policies that are possible, without incurring market wrath,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Financial Times in October.
“What gets the people in trouble is they come in, they have these ideas, but they don’t respect the market,” Bessent said. “You’ve got to respect the market.”
When Trump was reelected,investors cheeredthe potential for deregulation and tax cuts, while the Fed had recently cut interest rates, providing a boost for stocks.
Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, said he has not been surprised by the stock market’s ascent.
“The administration has largely delivered on a lot of those things that investors were so bullish about,” Mayfield said.
“Ultimately you zoom back and you say, ‘All right, it’s an AI bull market,’” Mayfield said. “The administration took the baton from the last administration only two years into a bull market, still with a lot of leg room left and companies growing their earnings.”
OpenAI wants to build the next era of the web, and it’s shelling out billions to do it
Mayfield said he expects the rally to continue, but he is also cautious about a potential pullback, given just how far things have run.
“I don’t expect a smooth ride,” he said. “I would expect a correction at some point in the next 12 months — 10% to 15% maybe.”
A growing chorus of Wall Street CEOs concurs: David Solomon, chief executive at Goldman Sachs, said he thinks there will be a 10% to 20% drawdown in stocks sometime in the next one to two years.
“Things run and they pull back so people can reassess,” Solomon said during a panel at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit in Hong Kong.
While the S&P 500 continues to hit record highs, the index is being carried by big tech and AI. It leaves everyday investors and 401(k)s increasingly exposed to enormous gains, but vulnerable to a downturn.
To Lerner at Truist, the bull market deserves the benefit of the doubt.
“The North Star of this bull market is corporate profits,” Lerner said.
But with stocks trading at historically expensive levels, there are risks abound.
“When you haven’t had a pullback since April, I think you’re just more susceptible to negative surprises, whatever those may be,” Lerner said. “You might be somewhat less able to absorb them.”"
Think the stock rally is over? It may just be beginning,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/27/investing/us-stock-market-rally,"Oct 27, 2025, 6:30 AM ET","The stock market rally has already defied expectations this year, shrugging off geopolitical strife, economic uncertainty and global trade tensions to reach fresh record highs. Some analysts say the rally might just be getting started.
The Dow closed above47,000 pointsfor the first time ever on Friday, buoyed by cooler-than-expectedinflation datathat supported hopes for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.
The S&P 500 has rallied 36% in just over six months, boosted by strong corporate earnings and optimism about Fed rate cuts. Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence had stokedbubble concernsbut also contributed to the market’s ascent.
“Absent some truly surprising and unwelcome events, the current momentum in the stock market is likely to last through the end of the year,” Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO at Bowersock Capital Partners, said in an email.
Stocks are historically expensive and US-China trade tensions persist. While there’s no shortage of concerns, the outlook remains positive for stocks, analysts said.
The bottom line: Corporate profitscontinue to impressWall Street, and the Fed is expected to lower interest rates, providing legs for a rally.
Companies are expected to deliver strong results this quarter, driven by “above trend growth” from AI companies, AI-related investments and a resilient consumer, analysts at JPMorgan Chase said in an October 21 note.
About 86% of companies in the S&P 500 that have already reported third-quarter earnings have posted results that beat expectations, according to FactSet.
The S&P 500 posted a historically strong September and is on track to notch its sixth month of gains in a row. But even that extraordinary growth doesn’t rule out further gains, investors said.
A fear of missing out on the rally, or FOMO, is also keeping stocks float, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
“With the Fed likely to cut rates two more times this year, and with AI collaborations continuing, I think right now, we are trading on FOMO fumes,” Stovall said.
“We’re running on adrenaline,” he said. “Valuations are still stretched, but at least in the near term, things are still looking good.”
Of course, it’s not all upside.
It’s a “high risk bull market,” according to Bob Doll, CEO at Crossmark Global Investments.
The labor market has shownsigns of weakeningin recent months. While consumer spending has held up so far, Doll said he is still concerned about a slowdown in spending — and a knock to corporate profits — if softness in the job market continues.
Wall Street will also be fixated on whether big tech companies can continue to impress with earnings. The Magnificent Seven group of tech stocks have accounted for roughly 41% of the S&P 500’s gains this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Jamie Dimon is worried about a stock market correction
Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) are expected to report earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are expected to report earnings on Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA), the star of the AI show, reports earnings on November 19.
Tesla (TSLA) reported earnings on October 22, and its profits missed analysts’ estimates. Tesla shares are down about 1% since it reported earnings.
“While the bull case is potentially potent, we are not convinced that the rising tide will sufficiently lift all boats in terms of upside profit surprise,” Lisa Shalett, CIO at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in a note.
The stock market has proved more resilient this year than many on Wall Street thought.
President Donald Trump’s tariff campaign has raised concerns about a slowdown in economic growth and resurgent inflation, but investors have tried to look past concerns and focus on corporate earnings.
Meanwhile, inflation data so far has been milder than expected. While the economy is showing signs of strain, likeborrowers falling behind on car payments, the stock market has pushed higher.
“Next year will bring new challenges, but we wouldn’t advise getting in the way of the upward trend between now and year-end,” Chris Zaccarelli, CIO at Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.
Just this month, the Dow dropped900 pointson October 10 after President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on China before recouping those losses and closing at a record high two weeks later.
Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to meet this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. Tensions have flared since Beijing on October 9 announced new export controls on rare earths and Trump the next day threatened new 100% tariffs, set to take effect November 1.
If there were to be a further escalation in US-China trade tensions, it could be another opportunity to buy the dip, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist.
“If something actually all of a sudden becomes more tense, and both sides dig in, and that’s kind of a short-term risk,” Lerner said, “We would be leaning into that risk if it were to happen.”"
Trump denies inflation is hurting Americans. It’s the same mistake that haunted Biden,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/trump-biden-economy-inflation,"Nov 4, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","“We have no inflation,” President Donald Trump said in his“60 Minutes” interviewSunday evening. “Our groceries are down.”
And withthose two false claims, Trump is repeating a political mistake that haunted his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and contributed to the Democrats losing the White House: Trump appears to be denying the economic reality that people are experiencing﻿ in their everyday lives.
Whether or not Trump is making a similar political miscalculation remains to be seen. Today’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City could serve as an indication.
Inflation is far from the crisis levels of the Biden years, but it never went away. And inflation is on the rebound again, rising in September to the highest annual rate since January in part because of the president’s tariffs.
Grocery prices aren’t down, either – they’re up across all major product categories, rising 1.4% since Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Denying that reality is a tough sell to Americans, many of whom seriously hate this economy, mainly because they feel those higher prices every time they go to the store.
A newCNN poll conducted by SSRSshowed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 47% call the economy and cost of living the top issue facing the country.
Bidenpolled miserably on the economy, too.
In June 2022, as millions of Americans were grappling with the highest gas price of their lifetimes and inflation hit a four-decade high, Biden highlighted strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
“Look, here’s where we are. We have the fastest growing economy in the world,” Biden said on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,”a claim that CNN later deemed false.
Biden conceded that inflation is “the bane of our existence,” but downplayed it by saying it’s “mostly in food, and in gasoline.”
That dismissiveness probably hurt the Democrats in last year’s election, considering Americans in 2024 said affordability was their chief concern. Even if inflation was falling, prices were still rising – just more slowly, and from painfully high levels. So voters weren’t exactly swayed by the Biden administration’s frequent statements that theeconomy was on fire.
“Wages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3% — the lowest in the world and trending lower,” Bidensaidduring his 2024 State of the Union address. “It takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.”
Voters didn’t buy it. Biden’s speech dismissed the cumulative effect of rising prices that voters were living through.
Trump’s tactics aren’t exactlyBiden’s. In 2023 and 2024, Biden correctly argued that price hikes were slowing. And when Biden acknowledged high prices, he typically tried to assign blame to corporations, lambasting “greedflation” and “shrinkflation.”
Trump is just straight-up doling out untruths – andblaming Biden.
But either way, the effect may be the same. Americans don’t take kindly to politicians who refuse to see voters’ lived experiences – especially when they’re smacked in the face with high prices on every supermarket trip.
Interestingly, Trump identified Biden’s flaw, and he and his campaign frequently criticized the former president for failing to sufficiently acknowledge the pain inflation had inflicted on Americans. Trump at campaign stops would sometimes pose with groceries, commenting on how unaffordable they had become.
The consequence of becoming president, of course, is that those inherited problemsquickly became Trump’s. But blaming Biden or denying reality doesn’t seem to be working. Trump is already starting to shoulder much of the blame for the bad economic vibes: About 6 in 10 (61%) say Trump’s policies have worsened US economic conditions, according to CNN’s poll.
Americans aren’t just kvetching about high prices; they’re (not) putting their money where their mouths are, and they’re changing their behavior.Chipotle, Coke, Crocsand other consumer brands said during earnings calls with Wall Street analysts last month that middle-class and lower-income customers are closing their wallets.
Despite a still-robust economy, on paper anyway, lackluster hiring is adding to Americans’ frayed nerves, as is the erosion of federal safety-net benefits.Loan defaultsand delinquencies are on the rise again among some of America’s most vulnerable.
The problem with inflation is that it’s cumulative. There is a snowballing effect from years of price hikes – even if those price increases are smaller today than under Biden after the pandemic.
The typical American household is spending $208 more per month to buy the same goods and services as they were in September 2024, according to Moody’s Analytics data based on the most recent inflation report. Keep in mind that in September 2024, Trump was on the campaign trail claiming inflation was out of control.
Zooming out further, Moody’s found that due to inflation, the typical household is spending $1,043 more per month than they did at the start of 2021.
In other words, to buy the same amount of stuff that Americans purchased four years ago, they ne﻿ed to spend $1,000 more of their paychecks.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week explained why Americans don’t care about metrics that politicians like to cite, including strong spending or gross domestic product booms.
“Consumers are not interested in that story,” Powell said in a media briefing Wednesday. “Their prices are higher. More than that, the reason they are so unhappy about inflation is the inflation we had in 2021, 2022 and 2023. You can say prices aren’t going up as much, but that doesn’t mean that people aren’t feeling those higher prices from the inflation we had two or three years ago. They are, and that is why a large part of the public, if you sample people, inflation is still very much making people unhappy.”
Powell noted it will take time – and growing paychecks – for the effect of higher prices to wear off.
“It will feel better over time, but that will take time,” he said.
Meanwhile, the lesson for Trump may have been best stated by Democratic political strategist David Plouffe.
In “Original Sin,” the book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson into Biden’s late-term cognitive decline, Plouffe said the fatal mistake by Democrats  was to deny the reality voters were witnessing.
“Never again can we as a party suggest to people that what they’re seeing is not true,” he said."
What bubble? The analysts and investors making the bull case for AI,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/27/tech/ai-bubble-analysts-bull-case,"Nov 27, 2025, 7:30 AM ET","Chipmaker Nvidia posted yet another blockbuster earnings report this month.
The stock fell anyway, as many investors worry that the market is in the middle of an about-to-burst AI bubble.
But for AI’s biggest believers, the report was just another sign that the industry’s train isn’t running out of steam anytime soon.
“Fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated in our view,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note last week. The Nvidia earnings report “is another validation point for the AI Revolution and (in) our view we are in the Top of the 3rd inning of this AI game  .”
The possibility of an AI bubble has loomed over the tech industry and Wall Street for years, but worries have ramped up sharply this year. Massive AI infrastructure spending, a string of circular deals among a few key big tech companies and seemingly endless rhetoric about AI’s world-changing potential – with little profit to show for it – have sparked concerns that we’re in for another dot-com-style bubble bursting.
About forty percent of the S&P 500 isnow made up of 10 tech companies, including Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, Oracle, Alphabet and Microsoft – all of which are betting big on an AI revolution.
There’s a lot at stake: The bursting of the dot-com bubble helped cause the 2001 recession and led theNasdaq to lose over 75% of its valueby late 2002.
But some analysts say investors should actually keep piling into AI. They argue there’s a big difference between AI and the dot-com era, when many early internet companies failed to find lucrative and steady business models, with notable exceptions like Amazon and eBay. AI companies, on the other hand, already have healthy business models or viable paths to profitability, they argue.
“The lesson of the dot com era is there was a bubble, it burst. We don’t think we’re in one now for AI,” Bob Michele, JP Morgan’s chief investment officer and head of the global fixed income, currency and commodities group,” said on CNBC last week.
And AI has far more potential to make money, Ravi Mhatre, co-founder of Lightspeed Venture Partners, told CNN. LSVP is a major backer of AI company Anthropic.
“The scale of revenue growth happening in this cycle is exponentially greater than prior cycles,” he said.
Rapid advancements in AI models also mean more uses are regularly popping up for the technology, Mhatre said.
Tech companies are already seeing increased cloud demand and productivity gains, especially in areas like coding and advertising. And there are plenty of growth markets geared to consumers –  ChatGPT recently addeda new toolto help shoppers research purchases, for example. But whether that growth will outpace costs, especially for smaller companies, remains  a big question.
Some investors believe the AI industry is at the beginning of a “super cycle” decade (or more) of innovation, investment and revenue. That could mean a global economy dominated and fundamentally changed by AI, they say.
“I tend to believe that the AI super cycle is real, that it is going to have a pretty profound impact on the economy, but you have to make room for the full range of outcomes when we price these things,” Marta Norton, Empower’s chief investment strategist, told Bloomberg Television last week.
Mhatre said there’s a bubble in that a rush of investments is chasing momentum that may not prove successful. But the industry itself might not be in a bubble.
“I do think both things are true. We’re in a hype cycle,” Mhatre said. “On the other hand, this kind of scale and speed with which value is getting created is also radically different than the prior cycles, where I just think the time that it took people to build technology and for it to be diffused was longer.”"
Markets are volatile. Here’s what to do with your money,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/business/investing-stocks-record-highs,"Oct 20, 2025, 8:00 AM ET","It’s been a whirlwind year for investors.
Stocks are hovering near record highs, but volatility is creeping back into markets as US-China trade tensions flare up. Gold and silver — safe havens during uncertain times — aresoaring higher.
Investors are worried about trade wars, signs of anAI bubbleand now credit market turmoil.
With all the uncertainty, it can feel overwhelming. However, long-term investors are best off keeping calm, tuning out the noise and sticking to a consistent plan that aligns with their financial goals, experts say.
“Rather than trying to time the next downturn, the smarter move is to stick to fundamentals,” said Jared Gagne, a wealth manager at Claro Advisors.
“Good investing is boring,” he said.
US stockshave been on arecord-breaking rally, rebounding sharply after tumbling in the spring over concerns about President Donald Trump’s tariffs. And Wall Street strategists say stocks have more room to run, with better-than-expected corporate earnings and Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts supporting stocks.
Still, concerns are lingering about a stock market bubble andhistorically expensive valuations.
It’s essential for investors to maintain a well-diversified portfolio with target allocations for each asset. An example of a classic portfolio includes 60% stocks, 30% bonds, 5% commodities like gold and 5% cash.
“Keep a diversified portfolio, rebalance when positions get stretched and continue investing on a disciplined schedule,” Gagne said.
“If one part of your portfolio has ballooned, consider trimming back to your target allocation rather than making wholesale exits,” he said. “This keeps gains aligned with your long-term plan while taking some profit off the table.”
Younger investors, who have time to make up for any market dips, can probably stand to have more in riskier assets like stocks; investors nearing retirement, who might need their money sooner and likely don’t have the same time to compensate for a market downturn, should have more more in bonds and cash-equivalents like Treasury bills.
“Make sure that you’re in an investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals,” said Ryan Kenny, portfolio manager at Crestwood Advisors. “One that’s predicated on quality and diversification and being in something that allows you to ride out the volatility that it is inherent in markets.”
Dollar cost averaging, when investors buy stocks at consistent intervals over time, can also help smooth out market ups and downs.
“That’s a good way to give yourself a discipline and not get kind of swept up in the heat of the moment,” said Tim Thomas, chief investment officer at Badgley Phelps Wealth Managers.
Timing the market by predicting where stocks will go is an exceptionally rare skill — and doing it consistently over long periods is even harder. For the vast majority of investors, staying put is much better than trying to sell or buy at peak opportunities.
The S&P 500 has rallied 30% since April. Investors who sold in the market panic that month missed out on those monster gains.
“Timing the market successfully requires being correct twice: 1) knowing the right time to exit and 2) the most opportune time to reenter,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “Investors are better off reminding themselves of the speed with which the market tends to recover from declines.”
History shows that the S&P 500 tends to rise in the long-term, rewarding investors who stay in the market. Since World War II, it has taken an average of four months from the bottom of a decline of up to 20% to get back to breakeven, Stovall said.
“The investors who focus on time in the market, not timing the market, are the ones who have the most success investing,” Gagne at Claro Advisors said.
As with all things in investing, there is no one-size-fits-all. Each person has their own financial goals and tolerance for risk.
But whatever your plan, it’s important to stick with it consistently.
“It’s really important to keep emotions out of it and have a system that’s repeatable no matter what’s going on in the market environment,” Thomas of Badgley Phelps Wealth Managers said. “Just keeping a level head is the key to success.”"
What will happen next in this topsy-turvy stock market? Choose your own Wall Street adventure!,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/17/investing/wall-street-economy-concerns,"Oct 17, 2025, 12:40 PM ET","The stock market issending mixed signalsat the moment, caught in a tangle of overlapping anxieties. Predicting its next move depends heavily on which narrative you want to believe.
You could choose door No. 1 and subscribe to the dominant concern of the week: A number of high-profile bankruptcies in consumer-facing industries may have exposed an underlying economic weakness thatthreatens parts of the banking sector.
A small number of regional banks have reported some bad loans this past week. The bankruptcies of a major auto parts company and a subprime auto lender have exposed bigger lenders, including JPMorgan and Wall Street finance company Jefferies, to potentially significant losses.
A number of the lenders are alleging they were victims of fraud. But if you believe these are canaries in the coal mine – and not a series of isolated incidents – it might mean a growing number of consumers won’t be able to pay back their loans or may rein in their spending with companies that owe banks a bunch of money. That could drag down lenders that are most susceptible if the economy really starts to take a turn for the worse.
To paraphrase JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week, these bank problems may becockroachesthat could signal the presence of other hidden cockroaches.
Markets hit their most recent record just last Wednesday. But they started to stumble after Chinaramped up export controlson keyrare-earth mineralsthat the Trump administration has been negotiating for months to free up. Those rare-earths are used in practically everything that beeps, including consumer electronics and military equipment.
President Donald Trump last Friday said he’s had enough, threatening a major re-escalation of the global trade war. He said he’dsend China’s tariffs higherby 100 percentage points and saw no need to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a high-profile planned meeting in South Korea later this month.
Trump and his administration quickly walked back those threats, confirming a Xi meeting was still on. And today Trump said he understood significantly higher tariffs on China wouldn’t be sustainable.
But Trump has changed his mind on tariffs before, and it’s too soon to count out amajor escalation in trade tensions. If that happens, Morgan Stanley analysts predicted the market could quickly tumble 11% into a correction.
Big Tech and the promise of AI have fueled the historic rise in stocks this year, particularly since April. But analysts have warned in recent months that this is a one-legged stool – and AI companies’ high valuations can’t support the market forever.
Some see echoes of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s that went bust in the early 2000s. Stocks have never been pricier as measured by the ratio of share price to companies’ actual sales. And the top eight most valuable stocks on the market – all worth north of $1 trillion – are all heavily invested in AI.
All that froth suggests to some that valuations have gotten out of whack with reality, and the AI-powered gains are due for a serious reality check.
Still, bubbles are notoriously hard to predict, and Wall Street’s majority opinion appears to be that the run-up in AI stocks as just the beginning of a long-run trend that will power the stock market for many years to come.
Investors have largely ignored the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs over the past six months, as prognosticators’ worst predictions about high inflation and a slowing economy have failed to come to fruition.
However,inflationison the rise, albeit slowly. Hiring hasslowed to a crawl. Trade with the United States has slowed due to higher tariffs. And some consumers have been jostled by rising prices, with delinquencies and subprime debt rising for lower-income tiers.
Ironically, cracks in the economy have helped drive stocks higher, because the underperforming job market forced the wait-and-see Federal Reserve to lose patience and start its recent rate-cutting campaign.
But the Fed may not be able to cut rates for long if so-calledstagflation– high inflation and stagnant economic growth – becomes a real concern. At that point, the Fed may be forced to deal with an inflation problem all over again.
Geopolitical tensions could be easing in Ukraine and the Middle East, and meetings are lined up between Trump and his Chinese counterpart; and with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. As with the recent ceasefire in Gaza, those meetings have the potential to turn down the temperature, at least somewhat, in some of the most concerning parts of the globe.
Meanwhile, worries about oversupply have pressured the oil market, with the price of Brent and WTI both at near five-month lows – potentially easing the inflation burden for Americans, if gas prices follow oil prices lower.
And the latest concerns about regional banks, though bringing back bad memories of a couple years ago, may prove to be as contained as theregional bank crisis of 2023.
More bad headlines may continue to jostle the markets in the near-term. But not much has really changed: Stocks are down just about 2% from their record high. If they fall further, that could present a good buying opportunity to get back into the market when stocks are relatively cheap.
“We would view deeper pullbacks as opportunities to lean in, as the bull market still deserves the benefit of the doubt,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist, in a note to clients Friday
Put another way: “We are keeping our powder dry and ready to buy the dip,” said Mohit Kumar, chief economist at Jefferies."
Wall Street has its worst day in a month as traders dial back expectations for Fed rate cuts,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/13/economy/us-stock-market,"Nov 13, 2025, 1:40 PM ET","US stocks closed sharply lower Thursday as investors sold shares in technology companies and volatility picked up on Wall Street.
The Dow fell 798 points, or 1.65%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.66% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.29%.
Investors also assessed how long it might take for economic data releases to be rebooted after theend of the government shutdown.
The House on Wednesday evening approved a funding measure that had been passed by the Senate. The bill was signed by President Donald Trump in the late evening, officially ending the longest US government shutdown in history.
Now Wall Street is focused on thebacklog of government datathat was delayed because of the shutdown — and how it might impact the Federal Reserve’s outlook for the economy.
“Lacking fresh economic data, markets have become increasingly jittery in recent weeks,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a note. “Now, as the government shutdown ends, each long-awaited data release or policy announcement will have the potential to move markets dramatically.”
The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq each had their worst day since October 10, when a flare up inUS-China trade tensionssent stocks lower.
Federal agencies begin to reopen after longest-ever shutdown ends
CNN’s Fear and Greed indexmoved from “fear” into “extreme fear.” Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 18% as volatility picked up.
“The gears of the government should be working again soon, and while that is a relief for markets and the economy, there is still plenty of uncertainty, particularly around the missed inflation and jobs data and how these fronts have been faring,” Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, said in an email.
Traders on Thursday were pricing in roughly a 52% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 63% chance on Wednesday and a 96% chance one month ago.
“The data blackout has made the Federal Reserve’s job difficult, but we still expect them to cut interest rates again in December,” Schleif said. “We expect markets to grind higher — though likely with continued volatility.”
The sell-off in stocks worsened in the afternoon. The third-quarter earnings season is also winding down, meaning there are fewer fundamental catalysts, and markets are more susceptible to moves based on investor sentiment.
Tech stocks have come under pressure in recent weeks as investors have voiced concerns about relatively expensive valuations. There has been rising skepticism about whether AI companies will be able to produce enough profits to justify the enormous amounts of spending taking place.
Tesla shares (TSLA) fell 6.6%. Palantir shares (PLTR) fell 6.5%, and Nvidia shares (NVDA) fell 3.6%. Oracle shares (ORCL) fell 4.15%.
“Investors are reevaluating the prices they’re paying for big tech and AI stocks,” said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird.
After a strong tech rally in recent months, investors have been taking profits and rotating into sectors that have lagged behind and look relatively affordable.
The Nasdaq has dropped nearly 5% since closing at a record high on October 29. The tech-heavy index has shed almost $2 trillion in market value across that time period.
Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he recently trimmed some of his exposure to tech.
“It just had such a monstrous run that it just made sense to take the profits and find other opportunities,” Samana said.
The Dow’s Thursday decline comes after back-to-back days of record highs. The blue-chip index closed above 48,000 points for the first time ever on Wednesday as investors moved into sectors including financials and health care.
Walt Disney shares (DIS) fell 7.8% on Thursday after the company reported earnings that did not impress Wall Street.
Elsewhere, bitcoin fell roughly 3.3% on Thursday and traded around $98,250. The cryptocurrency has struggled to regain ground since tumbling in recent weeks. Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $126,000 in early October.
Investors are trying to discern the Federal Reserve’s outlook for the economy ahead of the central bank’s policy meeting in December.
The Fed’s rate cuts in September and October helped provide a tailwind for stocks. Investors could get spooked if central bankers hold rates steady in December due to delayed data and a cloudy view of the economy.
“If sticky inflation forces the Fed to maintain restrictive policy, the cost of capital remains a headwind for valuations,” David Miller, CIO at Catalyst Funds, said in an email."
Fact check: Trump’s lying spree about inflation,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/inflation-trump-fact-check,"Nov 10, 2025, 2:45 PM ET","President Donald Trump went on a lying spree about inflation last week.
Grocery prices. Gas prices. Prescription drug prices. Overall prices. Over just three days, Trump made false claims about all of them.
Trump was discussing the issue of “affordability” after Democrats won state and local elections Tuesday in part bycampaigning on the cost of living. Hearguedthat this theme was “a con job by the Democrats” given how successful he said he has been in lowering prices.
But Trump repeatedly used inaccurate statistics and assertions to make his case that Democrats were dishonest. Here is a fact check.
Over and over, Trump claimed overall prices have fallen since he returned to office in late January.
“Every price is down,” hesaidThursday. “Everything is way down,” hesaidat another Thursday event. “Prices are down under the Trump administration, and they’re down substantially,” hesaidFriday, adding, “Everybody knows that it’s far less expensive under Trump than it was under Sleepy Joe Biden. And the prices are way down.”
None of that is true.
Prices are up during this administration. Average prices were 1.7% higher in September than they were in January, according to the most recentfigures from the federal Consumer Price Index, and 3% higher than they were in September 2024. Therehas been inflationevery month of the term, andfar more productshave gotten costlier than cheaper.
TrumpclaimedFriday: “We have almost no inflation. We’re down now to 2%.” He said at the same event: “Inflation is almost nonexistent.”
Those claims are slightly more accurate than Trump’s late-Octoberclaimsthat “we don’t have any inflation” and that “we’re down to 2%, even less than 2%.” But the new claims are still wrong.
Inflation not only very much continues to exist but has been accelerating since the spring. As of September, the year-over-year inflation rate hadincreased for five consecutive months.
The September rate, 3%, was the same as the rate in January, the month Trump returned to the White House. Inflation of 3% is simply not inflation of 2%. (Core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy prices,was also 3% in September.) And this “2%” claim wasn’t a one-time slip by Trump; heclaimedin late October, “We’re down to 2%, even less than 2%.”
Trump claimed on bothWednesdayandThursdaythat “groceries are way down.” Butgrocery prices are actually up. Average grocery prices rose 1.4% between January and September, Consumer Price Indexfigures show, and they rose 2.7% between September 2024 and September 2025. The 0.6% increase in average grocery prices from July 2025 to August 2025, meanwhile, was the biggest month-to-month spike in three years – and it was followed by a 0.3% increase from August to September.
Trump has repeatedly claimed that beef is the only grocery product whose price has increased this term. “Groceries are way down, other than beef,” heclaimedWednesday. “We have much lower prices than (Democrats) do, and we only have one thing, beef,” heclaimedThursday.
This is also false. The prices of dozens of individual grocery products increased from January to September. A smattering of products got less expensive over that period, most notablyeggs, but a far greater number of products got more expensive; you can see a listhere. Prices increased from January to September in five of the six overarching groups of grocery prices tracked by the Consumer Price Index.
Trump continued to usemathematically impossible figureswhen making claims about how much he is supposedly reducing prescription drug prices. “We’re bringing drug prices down to levels nobody ever thought was possible, tremendous cuts, 200%, 300%, 500%, 700%,” heclaimedThursday, adding later, “now we’re cutting it 1,000%, 1,200%.”
Trump has had some success in pushing drug companies to cut the prices of some medications; he made these comments at an event announcingreductionsin the prices of certain blockbuster obesity drugs. But far more medications have not had their prices slashed – and regardless, Trump’s professed reductions in excess of 100% make no sense even if he is talking about a small number of specific drugs. A price reduction of 100% would make a drug cost $0, so a reduction of 200% or more would mean Americans would be getting paid a substantial amount of money to acquire medications. That is not happening.
Trump has been making false claims about gas pricesformonths. HeclaimedWednesday: “Gasoline prices have plummeted to the lowest in two decades.” That wasnot even close to truegiven that the national average on Wednesday was $3.08, according to data provided by AAA – higher than it was on various days under Biden in January of thisyear, as well as during2020andearly 2021(amid the Covid-19 pandemic) and duringmuch of the 2000s and 2010s. “Plummeted” is also a stretch given that the AAA national average was $3.12 per gallon on the day Trump returned to office in January and $3.10 per gallon one year before Wednesday, both just barely higher than Wednesday’s $3.08 per gallon.
It’s possible Trump was attempting to refer to the federal Energy Information Administration’sestimatein September that drivers will this year spend “the smallest share of their disposable income on gasoline since 2005.” But that’s an estimate, not a certainty, and it’s simply not the same thing as Trump said about gas prices alone; “there’s a big difference between ‘lowest gas prices in 20 years’ and ‘least amount of your paycheck going to fill your tank in 20 years,’”Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, noted to CNN. It’s not necessarilyyourpaycheck, either. The federal estimate is based onoveralldisposable income in the economy, so some Americans have less than the estimate while others have more.
Trump also made other false claims about gas prices last week. On Thursday, Trumpclaimed, “We’re at almost $2 for gasoline.” On Friday, heclaimed, “We’re a little bit above $2 right now for gasoline.” Even granting Trump some wiggle room for the words “almost” and “a little bit,” there is no reasonable argument that a national average above $3 per gallon is “almost $2” or “a little bit above $2.” (De Haan said GasBuddy found one gas station, out of the tens of thousands of stations the company tracks, that sold gas for under $2 per gallon last week – and even that station only did so for a single day.)
Trump, echoing a claim he hasmadefor months,saidWednesday that Biden “had the highest inflation rate in the history of our country.” TrumpsaidFriday: “We took over a mess. The highest inflation in recorded history.”
It wasn’t the highest in history, as CNN and others have noted in numerous articles. Trump could have fairly said the inflation ratehit a 40-year high under Biden in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to theall-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920 – and Trump didn’t mention that it had declined to 3% by Biden’s last partial month in office in January, the same as the most recent Trump-era figure for September.
Trump’s claim was also incorrect if he meant the Biden presidency set a record for cumulative inflation over the course of a presidential term; the Biden-era increase was much smaller than the increase during President Jimmy Carter’s term.
TrumpclaimedFriday: “Energy prices are way down from what they were last year.”
But the Consumer Price Index shows thathousehold energy pricesare up substantially over the last year – 6.2% higher in September 2025 than they were in September 2024.
It’s possible Trump was not meaning to refer to household energy. A review of his recent comments suggests he often uses “energy” to describe eithergas prices at the pumps, which have fallen a little over the past year, oroil prices on world markets, which have fallenmore substantially.
So we won’t label this Trump claim false given that he could have been talking about the price of a barrel of oil. But when he doesn’t define the term “energy,” and speaks about it while discussing consumer prices, he leaves his assertion open to a possible misinterpretation."
Uncle Sam is outperforming the S&P 500,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/investing/equity-stakes-government-stock-market,"Nov 17, 2025, 4:00 AM ET","The Trump administration is investing in publicly traded companies — and it’s sending stocks soaring higher.
Under President Donald Trump, the US government has taken equity stakes in companies including Intel (INTC), MP Materials (MP), Lithium Americas (LAC) and Trilogy Metals (TMQ). Investing in public companies is an unusual move that has sparked debate on Wall Street and Capitol Hill about whether the government should be interfering in markets.
Proponents say the equity stakes are a strategic move to support companies in industries that are critical to national security, such as rare earths mining and the production of semiconductor chips. Critics, meanwhile, say it’s a heavy-handed use of government influence that is un-American and exposes taxpayers to unnecessary risk.
So far, the government’s portfolio is outperforming the S&P 500. Intel shares are up 77% this year. MP Materials shares have soared 276%. Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals shares are up 50% and 204%, respectively. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 14.5% this year.
“Markets seem to be understanding these deals as the federal government signaling it will continue to support these companies,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.
MP Materials is a rare-earths mining company. The company on July 10 announced the Department of Defense (now the Department of War) would purchase $400 million of the company’s stock, giving it a 15% equity stake and making it the company’s largest shareholder.
This company is America’s best chance to loosen China’s grip on rare earths
Intel, thebeleaguered chipmaker, announced on August 22 that the US government would invest $8.9 billion in the company, resulting in a 9.9% equity stake. On October 1, the Energy Department announced it would take a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas, a lithium production company.
Trilogy Metals, a mining company that is developing anenormous mining project in Alaska, announced on October 6 that the US government would invest in the company. The Department of War took a10% equity stakein Trilogy Metals.
The Commerce Department announced on November 3 that it would take a $50 million stake in Vulcan Elements, a private rare earths start-up. The government also has a“golden share”in US Steel as part of a national security agreement with Nippon Steel, which acquired the company in June.
The Trump administration’s actions are meant to address trade tensions with China, including bolstering supply chains of critical materials like chips and rare-earth minerals.
Rare earths in particular have become a sticking point in the US-China trade war. The minerals are used in everyday items like mobile phones as well as highly sensitive industries like defense, aerospace and the military.
What are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump’s trade deal with China?
China accounts for roughly 70% of global rare-earth elements mining output, 90% of rare earths refining output and over 90% of rare-earth magnet production, according to ING, a Dutch bank.
‘Self-sufficiency, allied resilience and national industrial champions are no longer optional,” James Litinsky, chief executive at MP Materials, said on the company’s earnings call on November 6. “They are the front lines of security.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that “the Trump administration is committed to using every tool at our disposal to safeguard America’s national and economic security.”
There is precedent for the government to take stakes in companies to bail them out during a crisis. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the government took stakes in companies including General Motors, Chrysler and AIG, then turned a small total profit when it exited those stakes by 2015.
But the government taking stock in companies outside of emergency situations is rare. Experts say it falls within a legal gray area.
“It is a real break from past attitudes toward government ownership, particularly for Republicans,” Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, said in an email.
Skeptics say this kind of government intervention goes against free market values — and raises the risks of big losses for taxpayers. It’s also uncertain that an equity stake can produce stronger supply chains.
Trump is trying to break China’s monopoly on rare earths, but can’t cut deals fast enough to catch up
“There is the risk of failure. Not all investments work out,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “You’re going to find people who are questioning, ‘Why are we doing this? We don’t need to risk our tax dollars.’”
Scott Ladner, CIO at Horizon Investments, said he was skeptical about the decision to take stakes in companies. The government historically has been poor at picking winners, he said, and it could divert money away from other, more compelling companies that are not in the government’s purview.
“I just don’t like the precedent that it sets going forward,” Ladner said. “These individual ones might end up working fine, but the precedent and the power that it gives to the government 10, 15, 20 years from now — I don’t love that precedent.”"
Why crypto is melting down and stocks keep falling,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/bitcoin-price-crypto-stocks,"Nov 18, 2025, 2:58 AM ET","Bitcoin and stocks are in a bout of volatility — and investors say more turbulence could be in store.
US stocks closed lower Tuesday, extending arecent tumble. The Dow fell 499 points, or 1.07%. The S&P 500 fell 0.83%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.21%.
The S&P 500 closed lower for the fourth day in a row, marking its longest daily losing streak since August.
Just six weeks after notching a record high above $126,000, bitcoin has plummeted more than 26%. The cryptocurrency on Tuesday afternoon traded just below $93,000, erasing all of its gains for this year.
Bitcoin late Monday haddipped below $90,000for the first time in seven months before paring some losses early Tuesday.
Investors in recent weeks have increasingly shunned risky assets like AI stocks and crypto. Not helping: uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. The risk-off attitude is weighing on bitcoin, a highly speculative and volatile investment.
In Wall Street terms, bitcoin is in a bear market — when a price falls more than 20% from a recent peak. Bitcoin has shed more than $600 billion in market value during its tumble, according to CoinMarketCap data.
“Bitcoin’s pullback is part of a broader shift in risk sentiment,” said Haider Rafique, global managing partner at OKX, a crypto exchange.
After a strong six-month rally in stocks, nerves are mounting about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies. A wide range of tech and AI stocks were lower on Tuesday: Nvidia shares (NVDA) fell 2.81%. Amazon shares (AMZN) fell 4.43% and Microsoft shares (MSFT) fell 2.7%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 6.6% since hitting a record high late October and has shed roughly $2.6 trillion in market value during its slide.
Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 10% on Tuesday.CNN’s Fear and Greed indexhovered in “extreme fear” and slid to its lowest level since early April.
Adding to the pressure on bitcoin: Long-term investors may be closing their positions to lock in profits after meteoric gains in recent years.
“Bitcoin has struggled as a result of selling pressure from long-term holders taking profits but also uncertainty around Fed policy, the liquidity environment and other macro conditions,” said Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management.
Bitcoin has struggled to meaningfully recover since aflash crashon October 10 when President Donald Trump reignited his trade war with China. Some buyers and sellers have left the market since then, so there are fewer orders for bitcoin, leaving the price more susceptible to volatility, according to Peter Chung, head of Presto Research.
“Bitcoin is under pressure in line with other risk assets (see the price actions of the AI stocks), but its downside is amplified due to a crypto-specific factor — namely, the orderbooks have gotten thinner in the aftermath of the (October 10) liquidations, which hurt many market makers in the space,” Chung said in an email.
Why crypto briefly but dramatically crashed when Trump renewed his trade war
Up until recent weeks, it had been a relatively strong year for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $69,000 ahead of Trump’s reelection in November before surging about 83% — amid bouts of volatility — to its record high above $126,000 in early October.
Bitcoinsurpassed $100,000for the first time in early December 2024 as investors leaned in to optimism about the Trump administration ushering in crypto-friendly regulations.
Trump has embraced the cryptocurrency industry and his administration has loosened oversight and advocated for pro-crypto legislation. TheGENIUS Actwas passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump in July, ushering in a new era of regulation forstablecoins, another kind of crypto.
Trump tapped Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto regulator, to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, and cryptocurrencies continue to enter the mainstream, with new exchange-traded products giving investors easier access to buying and selling crypto.
Bitcoin traded around $94,000 entering the year. It has now wiped out its gains over the past 11 months. By comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 is up 12.5% this year. Gold prices are up 54%.
Why some elite investors are turning on the darling of the AI rally
While tech stocks have also come under pressure, investors have been swooping in to the buy the dip. Nvidia (NVDA) on Friday tumbled as much as 3.36% before finishing the day higher by 1.77%. Nvidia on Monday fell as much as 3.08% before finishing the day lower by just 1.88%.
Meanwhile, bitcoin is still languishing around $93,000 and has yet to see a meaningful rebound. Some analysts say the crypto market is at an inflection point, where the positive catalysts this year have been priced in while there is increasing uncertainty about the outlook.
“How the market behaves over the next several days will signal whether this becomes a deeper reset or just a sharp, temporary dip in an otherwise intact cycle,” Rafique at OKX said.
Some crypto investors are still optimistic. Bitcoin in April had tumbled as low as about $74,500 before surging above $126,000 in early October.
“Right now, some investors see sideways churn and get spooked,” said Ryan Rasmussen, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management. “But in our view it’s the perfect opportunity for investors to build on existing bitcoin positions, and for those who have been sidelined to enter the market.”

Nasdaq suffers worst week since April as AI rally wobbles,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/07/investing/us-stock-market,"Nov 7, 2025, 12:34 PM ET","Tech stocks took a bruising this week as nerves persist about expensive valuations and a potential artificial intelligence bubble.
The Nasdaq Composite closed lower by 0.21% on Friday. The tech-heavy index fell 3.04% across the week and suffered its worst week since early April, when President Donald Trump’s announcement of so-called reciprocal tariffs rocked markets.
The benchmark S&P 500 gained 0.13% on Friday after falling as much as 1.3% during earlier trading. The blue-chip Dow closed higher by 75 points, or 0.16%, after sliding more than 400 points earlier. The Nasdaq fell as much as 2.1% earlier before recouping losses.
Stocks bounced off their lowest levels of the day on Friday as investors bought the dip and embraced hopes thatthe US government shutdown— which became the longest in history this week — might come to an end soon.
After a monthslong rally, skepticism is mounting about whether high-flying tech stocks will continue to produce superior returns.
Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, finished the day relatively flat but had jumped as much as 16% earlier as a tech sell-off weighed on sentiment.CNN’s Fear and Greed indexhovered in “extreme fear” and briefly hit its lowest level since April.
Stocks came under pressure this week as the CEOs of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley voiced concerns about elevated valuations, while Wall Street’s bar for positive surprises on earnings results continues to rise after a monster rally in stocks in recent months.
“There are some concerns percolating under the surface with AI valuations,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
AI and tech stocks have driven the market’s bull run in recent years. As stocks rally, they can become relatively more expensive, creating an additional layer of consideration for investors. Meanwhile, there is increasing skepticism about whether the enormous amounts of money being spent on AI will be justified.
Nvidia shares (NVDA) and Palantir shares (PLTR) — two stars of the AI trade — fell roughly 7.1% and 11.2% on the week, respectively, and each had their worst week since April.
Oracle shares (ORCL), which soared 36% in one day in September after the company announced a deal with OpenAI, have nearly erased all of their gains since then. It’s emblematic of the renewed uncertainty about the AI wave.
Oracle shares slid 8.89% this week and had their worst week this year.
“Sentiment and positioning have certainly become stretched, leaving the Mag Seven [tech companies] and broader tech complex vulnerable to profit taking,” Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said in an email.
“While there are some early yellow flags worth monitoring around circular and debt financing, much of the concern appears to be somewhat overdone in our view,” Melson said.
Also contributing to jitters this week: OpenAI, the center of the AI boom, found itself in some hot water after top executivesbacktracked from earlier commentsthat suggested government help might be needed to pay for the roughly $1.4 trillion in chips and infrastructure it has announced.
Why OpenAI went into crisis PR mode Thursday
“Nearly every major technology company in the US equity market has celebrated their entanglement with a company that lacks the resources to meet its obligations,” Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in a note. “These companies have each invited a much greater degree of uncertainty into their financial forecasts.”
The S&P 500 on Friday briefly dipped below its 50-day moving average, a key threshold. The index finished the week down roughly 1.63% and snapped a three-week winning streak.
While concerns about tech are weighing on the market, the prolonged US government shutdown is also lingering in the background.
“The government shutdown creates further risk because the longer it continues, the more its impact will be felt on Main Street,” David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, said in a note.
Consumer sentiment also just hit itslowest level since June 2022, according to the University of Michigan’s latest survey. It’s a sign Americans are feeling increasingly worse about the economy and their personal finances, with many respondents citing the shutdown.
Stocks rose off their lowest levels on Friday after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats were proposing a deal to end the shutdown. “Now, the ball is in the Republicans’ court,” he said.
It is not expected that the Republicans will accept the offer. Yet investors bought the dip Friday on optimism that the shutdown might end relatively soon.
“We believe we are approaching the end of the longest government shutdown of all time,” Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, said in a note. “Travel issues ahead of the Thanksgiving season will amplify pressure to end the shutdown, and uncertainty around the payment of SNAP benefits this month has continued to accelerate.”
While volatility has picked up on Wall Street, a drawdown in the S&P 500 would present a buying opportunity for long-term investors, according to Wren at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

America’s inflation is back at 3%. That’s higher than normal but not out of control,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/economy/us-cpi-consumer-prices-inflation-september,"Oct 24, 2025, 8:34 AM ET","The cost of living got even more expensive for Americans last month, with prices rising at the fastest pace since the start of the year.
Consumer prices rose 0.3% in September, which drove the annual rate of inflation from 2.9% to 3%, the highest it’s been since January, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday.
Gas prices, which shot up 4.1% overall and 4.2% for regular unleaded fuel (both the largest monthly increases since August 2023), were the biggest culprit behind the monthly increase, BLS data shows.
Food prices rose at a more moderate pace than they did in August (a month when grocery prices leapt by the highest rate in nearly three years). And housing-related inflation also continued its lengthy slowdown.
Economists were expecting that inflation would continue to pick up speed, rising 0.4% for the month and 3.1% from the year before, according to FactSet estimates.
Excluding food and energy, which can be quite volatile, the core measure of CPI rose 0.2% in September, with an annual inflation rate settling out at 3%.
Although better than economists had expected, Friday’s inflation data is a disconcerting reminder that prices are still rising faster than they typically should.
“There’s a psychological milestone of being back at that 3% level again,” Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an interview with CNN.
Due to inflation, the typical American household is spending $208 more a month in September to purchase the same goods and services as they were a year ago, and $1,043 more a month than they did at the start of 2021, coming out of the pandemic, new data from Moody’s Analytics showed.
The softer inflation reading for September gives a green light to a rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which has a policy meeting next week, wrote Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds.
However, Rupkey cautioned that the better-than-expected report might also be painting a rosier picture than actually exists.
“The immediate dangers from Trump 2.0 tariff policies have not yet fed through to inflation overall,” he wrote in a note to investors Friday. “The market will likely hold their applause, however, as one reason inflation is held in check may be due to the economic slowdown seen in many labor market indicators.”
Friday’s report provided further evidence that President Donald Trump’s steep import tariffs are causing certain goods prices to move higher. Categories such as apparel, home furnishings, footwear and appliances all continued to see price increases last month, and a closely watched inflation index (core goods excluding autos) is up 1.3% annually, which is the highest since August 2023.
However, the September report issomewhat unique in its own right: It’s the first major federal economic report released since the US government shut down on October 1.
September CPI, which was originally scheduled for release on October 15, is being belatedly published so that the government can meet deadlines to make cost of living adjustments for 2026 Social Security payments.

This burrito is everything you need to know about America’s economy,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/business/k-shaped-economy,"Oct 31, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Fact 1:America’seconomyandstock marketkeep growing, buoyed byrobust consumer spendingandAI mega-growth.
Fact 2:Hiring is at astandstill,inflationis rising,loan defaultsare abundant and Americans give this economy anear-record-low rating.
Confused? To understand how both of those things can be true, consider the burrito.
Chipotle on Wednesday reported miserable earnings and cut its sales-growth forecast for the third-straight quarter. The culprit: Young and lower-income consumers (Chipotle’s core customers) are cutting back on their spending, and they’re starting to skip the guac.
Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright on the company’s earnings call: “We’re not losing them to the competition; we’re losing them to grocery and food at home. And so, that consumer is under pressure. It is one of our core consumer cohorts. And so, they feel the pinch and we feel the pullback from them as well.”
Boatwright said the company’s customer surveys showed many believed Chipotle was no longer affordable. People in households that bring in less than $100,000 a year drive about 40% of Chipotle’s sales.
Another problem: 25- to 34-year-olds, who make up 25% of Chipotle’s sales, “pulled back meaningfully.”
“I think there’s a component of a more discerning consumer, and I think most of it – the majority of it – is this massive pullback,” Boatwright said. “That household under $100,000 a year is pulling back.”
At the same time, some consumers are spending like they’re from a completely different universe.
Crocs CEO Andrew Rees noted that bifurcation on a call with analysts Thursday: “There is a portion of our North American consumers that are highly affluent. They’re buying Crocs, they’re buying other high-end brands and they are in great financial shape,” Rees said. “But there is a large portion of consumers who are nervous, they are in less-good financial shape and are being super cautious about their spending and certainly spending closer to need.”
Or take Coke (to wash down your burrito). Coca-Cola’s Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun on a call last week with analysts said Coke’s earnings were boosted by strong demand for the company’s premium brands: Topo Chico, Smartwater and Fairlife.
But Braun highlighted a successful two-pronged corporate strategy, noting the tough environment for lower-income consumers hasn’t changed – despite the growth in its high-end brands. That’s why Coke is also cutting sizes (and prices) on the lower end to drive sales – to “really tackle not only affordability but premiumization as well,” Braun said.
“When we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said. “The pressure on middle- and low-end income consumers is still there.”
Economists call that phenomenon a “K-shaped” economy: Wealthier people are spending like nothing’s wrong. Lower-income people are making significant changes to preserve their finances.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powelladdressed that conceptWednesday in a media briefing.
“On the K-shaped economy … if you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big public consumer-facing companies, many, many of them are saying there is a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.”
It’s not all anecdotal: Last month, Moody’s Analytics reported that the country’s top earnersare accounting for a growing share of overall spending.
What’s causing that divide?
Wealthier Americans are generally invested in the surging stock market, which has gained 17% this year. They have more job security than lower-income workers. And they own homes, whichkeep appreciatingin the tight-supply market.
By contrast, less-affluent Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and their wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. If they lose their jobs, the cruddy labor market is preventing them from finding a new one – the number of Americans on unemployment insurance for multiple weeks recently surged to afour-year high. And rents, until recently, had jumped as demand for rentals explodes – because so few homes have been on the market.
A K-shaped economy can be difficult to repair. America’s economy has been increasingly bifurcated for quite some time – with the exception of a few years following the pandemic.
During those post-pandemic years, government support for workers gave lower-income Americans a leg up. For the first time in a generation, the wealth gap narrowed.Wages outpaced inflation, especially for lower-income workers. Interest rates were low, and homeowners refinanced like crazy to lock in historically low mortgage costs.
But it was short-lived. The sugar rush of government stimulus checks wore off, and the economy resumed its previous trajectory. Mortgage rates rose to multi-decade highs. And, concerning for people who are getting left behind, the US government began pushing safety-net programs in the opposite direction, reducing benefits and increasing hurdles to access support.
Those actions could widen that “K” in the future. Wider than you have to open your mouth to eat a Chipotle burrito."
Dow stumbles and tech stocks slide as volatility picks up on Wall Street,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/investing/us-stock-market,"Nov 6, 2025, 12:07 PM ET","US stocks closed lower Thursday as concerns mounted about expensive tech stocks, and a risk-off sentiment spread through markets after new data showed a bleak outlook for the job market.
The Dow closed lower by 399 points, or 0.84%, after briefly falling as much 524 points earlier. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.12%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.9%.
A wide range of tech and AI stocks fell, continuing a recent patch of volatility amid concerns about elevated valuations and nerves about a bubble.
Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slid 7.27%. Palantir (PLTR) fell 6.84%. Nvidia (NVDA) fell 3.65%.
Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 9%.CNN’s Fear and Greed indexhovered in between “extreme fear” and “fear.”
“Large cap tech stocks have been on an unstoppable run over the past six months, with particular strength over the past two months, and a pullback has been long overdue,” Robert Edwards, chief investment officer at Edwards Asset Management, said in an email.
“Big tech stocks have their hands on their knees, dripping with a bit of sweat and gulping for air — that’s a natural response after a monster run over the past few months,” Edwards said.
Meanwhile, investors rushed in to government bonds, pushing yields lower, after data showed an acceleration in layoff announcements last month. The number of announced jobs cuts in October wasthe highest increasefor that month since 2003, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
US Treasury bonds are considered safe bets when there are signs of a slowdown in the economy. A weakening labor market can also bolster arguments for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Investors tend to buy Treasuries when the Fed is expected to cut rates in order to lock in current yields.
Layoff announcements surged last month: The worst October in 22 years
“With yields still attractive and likely to fall, we continue to believe that quality fixed income offers an appealing combination of income and the potential to perform well in the event of slowing economic activity and further rate cuts,” Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note.
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Thursday that there are “a lot of things taking place today, and there’s a lot of turbulence out there.”
“That creates a little more uncertainty that you should be prepared for,” Dimon said at the America Business Forum in Miami. “And, hopefully, you know, we’ll continue to have the soft landing [taming inflation while avoiding high unemployment], but it may not happen. We just don’t know.”
Wall Street this week was also attuned to theSupreme Court’s deliberationsand oral arguments about the legality of President Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariff regime that relies on an emergency powers law.
Investors in recent months have looked past concerns about tariffs, while the revenue collected has helped assuage bond investors’ nerves about enormous US deficits. While a decision on the tariffs is not immediately expected, it could prove to be a thorny issue for investors if the tariffs are struck down — despite the headache they caused earlier this year.
Tariff refunds are now a very real possibility … and a giant ‘mess’
Stocks had been coming off a monthslong hot streak. The Dow rose every month from April through October, posting its best monthly winning streak since the end of 2017.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett’sfavorite market indicator, which compares a measure of the total value of the US stock market to the value of US economic growth, is also flashing a warning sign. The Buffett Indicator is at a record high above 217%, signaling the stock market might be strongly overvalued.
“The S&P 500 today is at historically extreme valuations,” Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said in a note.
Stocks have climbed higher this year on strong corporate earnings and enthusiasm about AI. Yet concerns also linger that the market’s gains are increasingly reliant on tech companies.
Wall Street’s bar for positive surprises is also rising, analysts say. Some companies that have reported third quarter earnings have beaten analysts’ estimates but are still seeing their shares slide. Shares in Duolingo (DUOL), the language learning company, plunged 25.49% on Thursday and had their worst day on record after the company’s outlook and guidance underwhelmed investors.
Meanwhile, bitcoin slid almost 3% and hovered around $100,650 in a sign of risk-off sentiment. The cryptocurrency has fallen roughly 20% since reaching an all-time high above $126,000 one month ago."
A tiny light in an economic data blackout is about to shine through the shutdown for a brief moment,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/economy/us-cpi-september-inflation-preview,"Oct 23, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Nearly two dozen days have passed since a federal agencyhas published an economic report. The US government’s shutdown has resulted in a blackout of critical data,further cloudingan already opaque economic outlook.
That will change – albeit briefly – Friday morning, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to release the Consumer Price Index report for September.
The September CPI will allow the data-hungry to get a little fix, providing a snapshot of how prices are trending for Americans.
The report is a one-off of sorts:BLS staff were called back into the officethis monthto allow the government to meet statutory requirements in adjusting Social Security payments for next year. The September CPI is the final piece of data needed for the 2026 cost of living adjustment.
So, after the CPI is released, darkness once again will envelop federal economic data until the government reopens.
(And as for the report itself, economists tell CNN that despite the circumstances behind the delayed release, they’re not concerned about the integrity of the underlying data.)
Economists expect the latest data to showthat prices for a slew of commonly purchased goods and services rose at a faster-than-typical clip (0.4%) last month. This would lift the annual rate of inflation from 2.9% to 3.1% – the fastest pace in more than a year.
There are many factors behind the upswing, including: pricier gas, food and tariff-impacted goods as well as slower-than-anticipated reduction in inflation on the services side – notably housing.
It’s helpful to remember that the last time inflation was below 2% was in February 2021, Michael Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN in an interview.
“At the macro level, it’s a reminder of how sticky inflation can be when it gets out of the tube and how hard it is to get to back to that 2% once it’s been above target for a while,” he said.
American consumers have weathered nearly five years of prices rising faster than they typically should (and prices rose far, far faster than usual for two of those years). However, years of high inflation have taken their toll.
Food prices, for example, have risen 24% between 2020 and 2024, noted Billy Roberts, senior analyst for food and beverage at CoBank, which provides financial services to agribusinesses and rural firms.
“We’ve seen smaller degrees of inflation, even over the course of this year, but it’s really that cumulative effect,” he said.
In August,grocery prices jumped 0.6%, the highest monthly increase in nearly three years, according to BLS data. Economists expect the September gain to be more mellow; however, certain categories likely will highlight pain points.
Beef prices, for example,have risen dramaticallyin recent years as herds have shrunk amidprolonged drought.Cocoaandcoffee prices, which have been pushed higher byclimate changestifling supply, nowface further pressures from tariffs.
Consumers stocking up for trick-or-treaters are now seeing the effects, Roberts said, noting cocoa prices are “still about double, if not triple, what they were in 2022-’23.”
“Those aren’t items that consumers necessarily buy week in and week out,” but they’re buying in bulk now for Halloween, he said. “Those prices are going to provide a lot of sticker shock for consumers.”
Food prices remain a sore spot for many Americansas do electricity prices, which also have been on the rise, Joe Brusuelas, RSM chief economist, told CNN.
In addition to those categories, Brusuelas noted he’ll be monitoring services-related inflation — such as airfare and other discretionary areas — and whether it’s remaining stubbornly high.
The Fed just cut rates. But relief might not come quickly enough for some Americans
“What I am concerned about is the sticky and stubborn service sector costs along with rising food and utility prices, which are really placing stress on middle-class and down-market households,” he said. “And this is a function of that greater discussion around the K-shaped economy, where 40% of this country is thriving.”
A recent analysis by Moody’s Analytics found that the country’s top-earners (who have benefited from a surging stock market, rising wages and increased housing wealth)are accounting for an even greater share of overall spending.
“Down market,” Brusuelas added, “it’s a very different reality.”"
What on Earth just happened to the stock market?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/business/stock-market-dow,"Nov 21, 2025, 7:48 AM ET","A day after Thursday’s anxiety-inducing fake out, Friday turned into Redemption Day on Wall Street.
The Dow ended the day 493 points higher, or 1.08%, after gaining as much as 800 points earlier in the day. The broader S&P 500 finished out the day 0.98% higher and the Nasdaq was up by 0.88%.
The earlier bounce back came after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said he supported lowering near-term interest rates, giving traders hope that they could geta December rate cut, after all.
Friday’s gains cap a topsy-turvy and highly confusing week for markets.
Going into Thursday, the sagging stock market had two big questions it wanted answered: Is the artificial intelligence bubble about to burst, and will the Fed cut interest rates in December?
At first, it seemed like traders finally got the clear response they had been eagerly awaiting:
Phew. Right?
Wrong.
Traders at firstcheered Thursday morning, sending all three major stock indexes sharply higher. At one point, the Dow was up more than 700 points. But by late morning, the rally started to wear off, and sentiment – and markets – turned sharply negative by midday.
Traders came to realize that the answers they thought they received actually just raised new, more difficult questions.
“People are trying to figure out A.) What’s better than off the charts in terms of what Nvidia can say from here and realizing that there’s no reward at these levels and B.) how the Fed can cut if jobs numbers are really better,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital.
By the end of the day Thursday, it was like nothing had changed: Markets resumed their slide that has sent the S&P 500 down more than 5% from the all-time high it reached just before Halloween.
Markets rebounded Friday, but Nvidia was essentially flat.Bitcoindropped by around 2% to levels not seen since April and is on pace for its worst month since 2022.
Nvidia’s quarterly earnings were so blow-out that investors began to fear that the world’s most valuable company and maker of the most precious commodity in tech – high-end AI chips – couldn’t possibly keep up this pace of growth for much longer.
Eventually, demand will ebb. And even if it doesn’t anytime soon, the AI market isn’t just Nvidia – other, less powerful companies could still be overinflated. Perhaps, traders feared, Nvidia’s earnings didn’t actually answer any of their questions at all.
Investors also looked more closely at aparticularly confusing jobs reportand realized it might not say exactly what they initially thought: The headline number showed much stronger-than-expected hiring in September, suggesting that the worst of the early-summer hiring slowdown may be behind us. The unemployment rate may have risen because more workers were entering the labor force, resuming their job searches after the summer lull.
Williams’ glass appears to be half empty. But if the Fed takes a glass-half-full approach – particularly after minutes from its last meeting released Wednesday showed significant resistance to another rate cut in December – perhaps that rate cut won’t be coming next month, after all.
So here we are on Friday, right back where we started.CNN’s Fear and Greed Indexis in “extreme fear” mode and at its lowest level since – you guessed it – April. The VIX volatility index briefly spiked to 27, its highest level since… do we even need to say it?
Until investors get satisfactory answers to their questions, expect more market volatility going forward. But with shutdown-delayed government data, an end to earnings season and traders about to go on vacation for the holidays, it’s not clear those answers are coming anytime soon.

Crypto remains on edge. That could be bad news for the stock market,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/01/economy/us-stock-market-bitcoin-yen,"Dec 1, 2025, 1:13 PM ET","Crypto had arough November. The pain is persisting into December — and that could signal trouble ahead for the stock market.
Bitcoin has slumped more than 6% in the past 24 hours, sliding from just above $91,000 to roughly $85,600 as of Monday afternoon. The cryptocurrency sold off sharply late Sunday — tumbling more than $4,000 in just a few hours — as December trading kicked off in Asia.
Bitcoin has seen intense swings in recent weeks asrisk-off sentimenthas spread through markets. In addition to a risk-averse mood, the latest freakout in the crypto world stems from concerns about the unwinding of a popular trading strategy.
So, what’s going on?
The Bank of Japan has signaled it could raise interest rates at its policy meeting later this month. That is throwing a wrench into a trading strategy that relies on borrowing relatively cheap Japanese yen.
For years, a lucrative trade for global investors has been to borrow yen to buy high-yielding assets like US stocks, or in this case, cryptocurrencies. Interest rates in Japan had been low or at zero, making borrowing yen relatively cheap and creating a sweet opportunity for traders. It’s known as the “yen carry trade.”
However, the Bank of Japan has signaled it could raise interest rates, in part to address stubborn inflation, continuing a recent shift away from years of ultra-low rates. Yields on benchmark Japanese bonds just hit their highest level since 2008, signaling expectations for higher rates. As rates in Japan rise, it can boost the value of the yen. That makes borrowing yen less affordable, eating into the profitability of the carry trade.
That could pressure traders to sell their bitcoin and stocks now to repay their loans and prevent the risk of further losses. In addition to a sell-off, it could lead to less cash flowing into crypto and stocks.
“This raises questions about the unwinding of the yen carry trade … which would drain liquidity from the system,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, said in a note. “That would not be good for the stock market.”
Bitcoin dipped below $84,000 Monday morning before paring some losses in the afternoon. US stocks closed lower: The Dow fell 427 points, or 0.9%. The S&P 500 fell 0.53%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.38%.
For crypto, the sell-off has been widespread: Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has tumbled almost 9% in the past 24 hours.
Bitcoin’s tumble comes on the heels of asteep sell-offin crypto markets just weeks ago. Bitcoin in late November fell to just above $80,000 — down roughly 35% from a record high above $126,000 in early October.
The slide in bitcoin led stocks lower and, in particular, thetech stocksthat had been carrying the market. The S&P 500 fell almost 5% at one point in November before rallying and slighting gaining for the month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its first losing month since March.
Markets are “not out of the woods quite yet,” Maley said.
“The renewed decline in bitcoin could create some real problems for the stock market,” he said in a note. “If the issues which are creating this decline do not subside, the year-end rally scenario will run into some real headwinds.”
In a sign of the risk-off mood, investors are again piling in to gold and silver, which are considered safe havens amid uncertainty. The price of silver hit a record high on Monday as investors scooped up the metal, which can be considered a cheaper alternative to gold.Silver priceshave doubled this year, and have also been boosted by increased industrial demand.
Proponents of bitcoin say volatility is part of the journey. Meanwhile, critics say bitcoin is falling short of its proposed use as a store of value, given its susceptibility to intense fluctuations. Bitcoin is now down roughly 9% this year, while the S&P 500 is up roughly 16%, and gold is up almost 62%.
All things considered, the S&P 500 is less than 2% below a record high set in late October. December is a historically strong month for markets, and Wall Street is leaning in to bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month, which could boost stocks. However, more volatility could be in store as bitcoin languishes more than 30% below its record high and nerves linger about the yen carry trade.
“With all of this in mind, we’re still at a key juncture for the stock market,” Maley said. “The developments out of Japan are creating some uncertainty about a year-end rally … so the ‘all clear’ flags are not flying high just yet.”"

Stocks were mostly higher Tuesday after the Senate on Mondayapproved a funding measureto end the government shutdown. The bill now heads to the House for approval before being sent to President Donald Trump’s desk.
“With the Senate passing the stopgap funding bill, it is likely that the government shutdown will end by the end of the week,” Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies, said in a note.
Investors also rotated out of tech stocks on Tuesday and shifted into other sectors including health care, energy and consumer staples. That helped boost the Dow, which is less exposed to the tech and AI wave. Twenty-six out of 30 companies in the blue-chip Dow closed higher on Tuesday.
A potential end to the government shutdown would also mean the subsequent release of key economic data on the job market and inflation that had been delayed. The return to regularly scheduled releases of data can also provide a boost of certainty and confidence for investors.
In the last 15 government shutdowns going back to 1981, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 2.7% in the month after the government reopened, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said in a note: “A finalized deal later this week is expected to drive stocks to stronger advances, as a significant economic risk is pushed to the rear-view mirror and replaced with improved prospects for the holiday season.”

Polls show Trump’s happy talk on inflation is falling flat,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/politics/inflation-polls-trump,"Nov 20, 2025, 1:04 PM ET","The 2025 election two weeks ago crystallized how big a problem the economy and affordability appear to be for President Donald Trump and the Republican Party.
Trump’s initial strategy for dealing with this problem appeared to be  pretending it didn’t actually exist. Trump set about falselyclaiming prices were actually down, that there is “almost no inflation,” and that everything was more or less hunky dory.
Itwas bizarre, even from a president who often seems to reside in his own elaborately crafted alternate reality.
And it appears to be falling flat.
New polling conducted since Trump began driving this message shows Americans continue to see things very differently than Trump has cast them. And their reviews of his economic stewardship appear to actually be getting worse.
“Our groceries are way down. Everything is way down,” Trump said November 6. “Groceries are way down, other than beef,” he said at another point. He added last week that grocery prices were “already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.”
But just 12% of Americans said grocery prices have gone down over the last six months, according to a newMarquette University Law School pollconducted November 5 through 12.
By contrast, 75% said they’ve gone up.
(Average grocery prices were indeedup roughly 1.4%in September compared to when  Trump took office in January, and the 0.6% jump in one month from July to August was the largest in three years.)
Even among Republicans, only 2 in 10 subscribed to Trump’s alternate version of reality in which prices are actually dropping. A majority said prices are up.
The numbers were similar in a Fox News poll released Thursday.
That poll, conducted November 14 to 17, showed 85% of registered voters  said grocery prices are higher than a year ago, with 60% saying they’ve “increased a lot.”
Around two-thirds or more also said the prices of utilities, healthcare and housing were up.
(“A year ago” technically includes two months in which Trump was not yet president, but it stands to reason people perceived the question as being mostly about his tenure.)
Perhaps most striking: The percentage who say grocery prices are up “a lot” (60%) is significantly higher than the percentage who said that about groceries and everyday items back in October 2021 (43%). This despite inflation back then having been about double what it is today.
That suggests this problem is really ingrained – and will be difficult for Trump to defeat with happy talk.
Trump has claimed there is “virtually no inflation,” “almost no inflation” and said inflation is “almost nonexistent.” He has also said “we don’t have any inflation.”
In fact, inflation has remained stubborn throughout Trump’s tenure and is at about 3% on an annualized basis – right where it was when he took over.
And the perception might be even worse.
52% of registered voters  said inflation was “not at all” under control, according to the Fox poll. That includes nearly two-thirds of independents (65%).
Fewer than 2 in 10 overall – and only one-third of Republicans – said inflation was at least “mostly” under control.
To the extent Trump has allowed that there are economic pains, he’s generally cast them as remnants of the Biden era.
“Biden was a disaster with affordability,” Trump told Fox News shortly after the election. He added: “When I took over, it was a mess.”
But this, too, appears to be a losing argument.
The Fox News poll asked whether Trump or Biden were more responsible for the current economy, and voters  chose Trump, 62%-32%.
Only around half of Republicans (53%) blamed Biden.
The gamble for Trump in pitching this alternate reality is evident: If people don’t ultimately subscribe to it, they might come to view Trump as out of touch and  not taking the problem seriously enough.
Already,CBS News-YouGov pollinghas shown 75% of Americans and a majority of Republicans have said Trump is not focused enough on lowering prices.
And indeed, it seems Trump is doing himself no favors right now. If anything, his political picture on the economy and affordability is worsening:
The same poll shows Americans say by about a 2-to-1 margin that they expected Trump’s policies will continue to increase inflation.
Indeed, Trump has given people plenty of reason to attach whatever happens with the economy to him. That’s what happens when you rock the economy with a series of unilateral global tariffs that weren’t even endorsed by Republicans in Congress.
Trump voluntarily took ownership of the economy. Now he wants to disclaim the reality of what’s followed.
Political analysts love to mine Trump’s actions for secret political strategy and three-dimensional chess moves. But this seems more like desperation than anything else."
Money moves to make now that the Fed has cut rates (again),https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/business/interest-rate-cut-fed-money-moves,"Oct 29, 2025, 3:00 PM ET","For the second time this year, the Federal Reserve on Wednesdaydecided to lowerits key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted during a briefing with reporters on Wednesday that it isnot a foregone conclusionthat the central bank will opt for third rate cut this year at its upcoming December meeting.
For now, though, the Fed’s move on Wednesday will affect various consumer savings and lending rates throughout the economy.
How? In brief, it may make it a little harder — but still possible — to find attractive,inflation-beatingyields for your savings if you comparison shop. And on your debts, the Fed’s moves may save you some money but not nearly as much as your taking advantage of other options. More on all that below.
Even if the rates available today move down a bit given the Fed’s latest move, there are still plenty of low-risk options that let you grow your savings and protect your purchasing power.
Fed cuts interest rates for the second time this year
Online high-yield savings accounts:Online high-yield savings accounts at many small FDIC-insured banks are still offering yields north of 4%, far higher than the 0.1% you might earn on a traditional bank savings account. Why? Because the online players are competing to attract deposits.
In fact, while many bank account rates typically follow the Fed’s moves quickly, the online high-yield savings accounts rates haven’t fallen as much as the Fed’s overnight lending rate. “Some dropped around 10 basis points, but they haven’t fallen 25 basis points since (the Fed’s cut) last month,” said Ken Tumin, co-founder of DepositQuest.com. In the wake of a full percentage point of cuts by the Fed in 2024, Tumin said, many online high-yield accounts fell by only 60 to 70 basis points.
Money market accounts and funds:Many money market bank accounts at FDIC-insured banks were offering rates of between 3.40% and 4.25% ahead of the Fed meeting, according to Bankrate data.
And money market mutual funds — which are not FDIC insured but nonetheless are considered very low risk for cash — were paying an average of 3.92% as of Tuesday, according to Crane Data.
While the funds’ rates will come down in the coming weeks, they may not do so by quite as much as the Fed rate. For instance, the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund currently has a 7-day yield of 4.05%.But that is only 15 basis points below the 4.19% it was offering in September right before the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points, Tumin said.
Certificates of deposit:On Schwab.com, the best rates for CDs with terms of anywhere from three months to five years were between 3.6% and 3.95% on Wednesday. Those rates may come down some in the coming days, but they will still exceed the latest 3% inflation reading.
Normally, if you withdraw money from a CD before it matures, you forfeit some of your interest earnings. But some banks offer what are called no-penalty CDs for up to 13 months. You get to lock in your rate for that time period but can take the money sooner without penalty. One such no-penalty CD is currently on offer by Marcus for 3.95%.
You can buy a CD direct from banks, some of which are offering very attractive rates north of 4%, Tumin said. Or you can buy CDs from banks around the country through your brokerage — which give you the option to trade it before the term ends, which could result in a capital gain or loss depending on the price the day you sell. Ideally, if you plan to hold a CD to term, try to find one that is not callable, meaning the issuer won’t recall it before the term ends.
Treasuries and municipal bonds:On Wednesday ahead of the Fed’s announcement,T-bills(with durations up to 52 weeks) had average yields ranging from 3.63% to 3.81% perofferings on Schwab.com.
Treasurynotes(with durations from two to 10 years) had average yields between 3.50% and 3.99%.
And AAA-ratedmunicipal bonds(with durations up to 4 years) had rates from 2.43% to 3.46%.
After the Fed’s meeting, bond prices fell,pushing yields higher.
How much interest you actually net from cash-equivalent and fixed-income investments like CDs and federal and local government bonds depends on how they’re taxed. CD interest is taxed at the federal, state and local levels, while yields on Treasury bills, notes and bonds are usually exempt from state and local income taxes. Municipal bond interest, meanwhile, is usually exempt from federal income taxes — and may be completely tax free if you buy a muni issued by your home state, city or county.
So, when deciding between CDs and bonds,compare the after-tax yieldyou’d get in order to figure out which offers you the best deal.
Or, if you don’t want to buy individual bonds through your brokerage or viaTreasuryDirect.gov, you might consider a low-cost intermediate-term Treasury bond index fund.
How much debt you choose to take on, how quickly you plan to pay it off and how high you can get your credit score before applying for a loan may save you more money than a small rate cut or two from the Fed.
Credit cards:Take credit cards. The average rate is still a hair north of 20%, according to Bankrate. And, per Lending Tree, the average rate on anewcredit card is 24.19%.
So, if you’re carrying debt from month to month and paying double-digit interest rates – never mind 20% or more – forget the Fed. “(By) getting a 0% balance transfer credit card or even simply calling your lender andasking for a lower rate, you can find significantly bigger reductions than you’re likely to ever get from the Fed,” said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at Lending Tree.
Mortgages and home equity loans:Rates on mortgages track movements in the 10-year Treasury yield, which moves in anticipation of Fed rate decisions and other economic indicators.
The average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has fallen by nearly a full percentage point since mid-January (when it was 7.04%). Last week, it came in at 6.19%.
For homebuyers, that drop alone on a $350,000 mortgage amounts to savings of nearly $197 a month.
And for those who already have a mortgage, if your current fixed rate is at least a percentage point higher than what you could get by refinancing, “make a move to refi,” said Stephen Kates, a certified financial planner and Bankrate financial analyst.
As for borrowing against home equity, lending rates have been coming down slowly. As of last week, the average rate on a home equity loan was 8.11% and the variable rate on home equity line of credit (HELOC) was 7.85%, according to Bankrate. They will move lower still over the next few months.
If you already have a variable rate HELOC or are getting a new one, your rate will automatically adjust downward.
If you’re applying for a new fixed-rate home equity loan, you can do more to lower your own rate than just depending on small cuts from the Fed.
“The length of your home equity loan will impact your rate. The longer the loan, the higher the rate,” Kates said.
Just as important, he added, is to focus on improving your credit score, unless it’s already excellent. “If you’re thinking of a renovation in six months, that’s all you should be thinking about. It’s the biggest and quickest way to take a rate down.”
Car loans:You can do more to make a car affordablethan a quarter-point cut by the Fed can.
As of September, the average APR was 7% on loans for new vehicles and 10.7% on used ones, while average monthly payments came to $761 and $570, respectively, according to data from Edmunds.com, which also offers astate-by-state breakdownof average rates.
To really keep yourmonthly paymentsin check, improve your credit score to qualify for the best rate and don’t buy more car than you need.
“Affordability is still amajor hurdlefor many shoppers, but the end of the year has traditionally been a popular time to buy. Dealers are eager to clear out 2025 model-year inventory, and November’s Black Friday promotions typically kick off a stretch of holiday deals,” said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds.com head of insights.
If you’re tempted by low-APR promotions, their terms may be capped at 48 or 60 months. So make sure you can manage those monthly payments. Longer loan terms may offer lower monthly payments, but you will end up paying more in interest in the long run."
Why some elite investors are turning on the darling of the AI rally,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/nvidia-elite-investors,"Nov 18, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.
Three prominent investors with almost nothing in common are dumping their shares of Nvidia, the computer chip juggernaut that went from relative obscurity to the world’s first $5 trillion valuation in just three years.
It’s hard to overstate Nvidia’s superlatives. On its own it makes up 8% of the total value of the S&P 500. Its annual net income grew more than 580% between 2023 and 2024. It’s become almost a joke on Wall Street that the company consistently blows past expectations, notching quarter after quarter of financial gains, thanks to seemingly bottomless demand for Nvidia’s sophisticated chips, which are key to building artificial intelligence models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude.
So why sell now? Isn’t betting against Nvidia now a bit like betting against the 1995 Bulls? (As in, you’d be out of your mind to do so)?
Maybe not. There are any number of reasons why investors would sell Nvidia, but the timing of these recent moves is fueling concerns that the company — and by extension, the entire AI industry — is part of aspeculative bubblethat’s bound to burst.
On Monday, a regulatory filing showed tech billionaire Peter Thiel’s hedge fund had, sometime in the three months ending in September, sold itsentirestake in Nvidia — all 537,742 shares, which would be worth about $100 million as of September 30, the last day of the quarter. The disclosure, three days ahead of Nvidia’s upcoming earnings release, rattled investors, who are already nervous about when, or whether, they’ll see a return on their AI investments.
Thiel’s revelation came days after Japanese conglomerate SoftBank said it had sold all of its Nvidia holdings for $5.8 billion. And earlier this month, Michael Burry — the “Big Short” investor who anticipated the housing market’s collapse in 2008 — disclosed that his hedge fund had bought $9.2 million in “put” options against Nvidia and Palantir, another AI darling, essentially wagering that their stocks will fall.
What do Thiel, Burry and SoftBank know about Nvidia that the rest of us don’t? What are they seeing that the rest of Wall Street can’t (or doesn’t want to) see?
To be sure, these folks all had their reasons, and not all of them are directly bettingagainstNvidia or AI.
SoftBank and its CEO, Masayoshi Son, remain fully aboard the AI hype wagon. But they also needed to gin up a bunch of cash soon to complete a nearly $23 billion investment in OpenAI, prompting them to take their Nvidia profits.
Burry’s position is a much more skeptical one. In a post on X, Burry wrote that he believes Big Tech companies are“understating depreciation”around Nvidia’s core product — essentially, they’ll soon be sitting on a bunch of equipment that’s obsolete, and they’re undervaluing how much that will hurt their bottom line.
Representatives for Thiel, a co-founder of surveillance software giant Palantir and a guy whoreportedly believesthat strictly regulating AI tech will hasten the arrival of the Antichrist, did not respond to a request for comment. Thiel has previously staked out a fairly conservative position on AI,tellingthe New York Times’ Ross Douthat that the technology is “more than a nothing burger” but “less than the total transformation of our society.”
The timing of these moves — coming the same quarter that Nvidia hit $5 trillion in market value (it’s now back down to a measly $4.5 trillion) — may be purely coincidental. But they’re not helping soothe any nerves on Wall Street.
“I don’t read a lot into people’s timing with respect to this stuff,” Paul Kedrosky, a partner at SK Ventures, told CNN. “But I do think that there’s been a kind of Gestalt shift in terms of how people think about this entire area and what are reasonable assumptions about future growth.”
Nvidia sank 2% Monday, even as analysts expected the company to once again deliver a solid earnings report on Wednesday. Other tech stocks and crypto followed, dragging the broader market down. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 13%.CNN’s Fear and Greed indextraded in “extreme fear” and hit its lowest level since early April.
“I think we’re at a tipping point of this bubble,” Mike O’Rourke, chief market atrategist at JonesTrading, told CNN Monday. “And then you have all these other things that were just massively speculative this year,” he added, citing the crypto rally and the expansion ofdigital asset treasury companies. “Now you’ve seen that very speculative aspect start to unwind, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it bleeds over and people get a little more cautious.”
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the amount Michael Burry spent on puts. He spent $9.2 million."
"Nvidia beats earnings expectations, even as bubble concerns mount",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/nvidia-earnings-ai-bubble-fears,"Nov 19, 2025, 4:25 PM ET","Nvidia posted strong revenue and profits that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations Wednesday. The closely watched result could prompt a sigh of relief across the stock market following growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble.
Nvidia’s sales grew 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the October quarter, ahead of the $54.9 billion Wall Street had projected, signaling that demand for AI chips remains strong even as more questions emerge about whether returns from the technology will keep up with the pace of infrastructure investments. It posted profits of $31.9 billion, up 65% from the year-ago quarter and also slightly above expectations.
“Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, a message that echoes his earlier arguments that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.
The company also posted stronger-than-expected sales guidance of around $65 billion for the fourth quarter, another indicator that the AI spending spree isn’t slowing anytime soon.
Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) jumped 3.4% in after-hours trading immediately following the report.
Nvidia has become both the backbone and an emblem of the AI boom, with much of the industry’s technology running on its chips. Theworld’s most valuable public companyhas also been central to this year’s stock market rally — it accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500 and its deals with other tech firms have helped fuel their stocks, too — meaning that nearly all investors and 401k holdersstand to be impactedby Wednesday’s results.
Fears of an AI bubble ahead of Nvidia’s report had caused volatility across the stock market as investors adopted a risk-off attitude and dumped assets like bitcoin and AI stocks.
Shares of other tech stocks — including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google — were in the green in after-hours trading following the Nvidia report, underscoring the chipmaker’s impact on the wider market.
“This answers a lot of questions about the state of the AI revolution, and the verdict is simple: it is nowhere near its peak, neither from the market-demand nor the production–supply-chain sides for the foreseeable future,” Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in emailed commentary following the report.
At the heart of the bubble concerns are the circular funding deals that Nvidia and other chipmakers have formed with AI companies, such as a$100 billion investmentin OpenAI in exchange for chip purchases that was announced in September. OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar further raised eyebrows earlier this month whenshe suggestedthat the government should backstop the debt tech companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure — a statement the company later tried to walk back.
But the fears haven’t stopped Nvidia from making more such deals. Anthropic on Mondaycommittedto buying $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft Azure, running on Nvidia chips, in exchange for an investment in the AI lab from both tech giants.
Huang has repeatedly batted down bubble concerns. At the company’s GTC AI conference last month, he told CNN that people’s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is “profitable,” even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they’re earning into new infrastructure.
The fact that Nvidia’s business continues to hum isn’t surprising given that tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Googleall indicatedin their most recent earnings reports that they plan to continue hiking their AI infrastructure spending. Huang alsolaid outat GTC the company’s plans to get its technology into even more areas of life — from cell phone towers to self- driving cars.
Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress sought to reinforce that AI is generating returns in the company’s earnings call by taking the unusual tack of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads;” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year; and Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off."
"Amid tensions with US, high inflation is back on Venezuela’s streets",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/11/americas/venezuela-inflation-us-tension-intl-latam,"Nov 11, 2025, 12:01 AM ET","As Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro faces growing USmilitary pressureand calls for his resignation, an old foe is returning to haunt him in his own backyard: Inflation, one of Venezuela’s chronic economic maladies, is on the rise again.
“Prices are growing every day,” said Yon Michael Hernandez, 25, a motorcycle taxi driver in the slum of Petare, east of Caracas.
“Corn flour is 220 bolivars today, it may be 240 tomorrow and 260 the day after, and the same package that might have cost you one dollar 15 days ago is worth three now,” Hernandez told CNN. He referred to the Venezuelan currency and to the pre-cooked flour used to makearepas,the ubiquitous corn pancakes that are a daily staple.
In the three months since the Pentagon deployed warships and aircraft in a campaign that the White House said was aimed at drug traffickers from Venezuela, the bolivar has depreciated around 70% against the US dollar, according to data from the central bank, hemorrhaging one point every day.
In the illegal but widely used currency black market, the drop has been just as steep. At the official rate, the US dollar is pegged at about 231 Venezuelan bolivars. On the black market, a dollar is worth roughly a third more. The Venezuelan government prohibits publishing black market exchange rates.
The surge in inflation is linked – although only partially – with the growing tensions between the Trump administration and the Maduro government, which has been under US Treasury Department sanctions for almost a decade.
Venezuela urges residents to report neighbors with app
Maduro has accused the United States of seeking to oust him after more than 12 years in power and one year after he controversially claimed to win a presidential election that many international observers accused him of stealing.
While a military attack on Venezuelan soil may not materialize, the economic outlook is firmly in the red once again, after a change of policies gave the country a much-needed boost in the years immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic.
Only last year, Maduro boasted about the results of those reforms, claiming his country’s GDP was growing at 8% and that inflation was at the lowest rate in four decades. The autocratic leader no longer makes such claims.
According to the United Nations, Venezuela historically does not produce enough food to meet its needs, and many products must be imported from abroad and paid for in foreign currencies.
This also means the market is particularly exposed when the bolivar loses value.
For many Venezuelans, still reeling from years of hyper-inflation before the pandemic lockdowns, the new price hikes revive a familiar nightmare.
“Not many people are purchasing these days. Those who can try to buy as little as possible,” said Marjorie Yanez, 40, a street-food seller in Caracas. “Dollars get more expensive every day, and that is bad for retailers like us because we also must raise our prices every day.”
A typical breakfast of croissant andcafé con lechenow can easily cost the equivalent of $8 to $10 at a bakery in Caracas, while the country’s official minimum wage is less than a dollar a month.
The stream of remittances from relatives abroad, a consequence of more than 7 million Venezuelans fleeing the country under Maduro to look for better opportunities elsewhere, is also falling short.
“I had to increase how much I send back to my parents every month, but even with that, it’s not enough. They can barely make ends meet,” said Diego Mejias, 35, an architect in neighboring Colombia who provides for his parents in Caracas.
The central bank stopped publishing inflation reports in October last year, when the country had managed to keep the rate at single digits for 20 straight months.
Shortly afterward, things began to unravel.
In July, Venezuelan security forces briefly detained several economists, including former finance minister Rodrigo Cabezas, for sharing pessimistic views. The interior minister called their comments destabilizing. Critics denounced the arrests as baseless.
The economists were later released, but publishing economic figures remains taboo.
For many Venezuelans, economic fears trump concerns of US military action
For this report, CNN spoke with two private consultants who have access to reliable economic data. Both spoke anonymously for fear of government retaliation.
CNN has also contacted Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who is in charge of Venezuela’s finances, and is waiting for a response.
Both consultants estimated that inflation in Caracas is currently running between 20% and 30% a month and is destined to keep rising as long as the bolivar depreciation continues.
Prices are slightly cheaper outside the capital in regions such as Tachira or Zulia, closer to the Colombian border, where many imported products cross into Venezuela.
Faced with the economic malaise, the government has cracked down on the black market for US dollars. In June, Attorney General Tarek William Saab announced the detention of 58 people on charges of “manipulating exchange rates.” Authorities also seized a dozen web pages advertising the sale of dollars and euros at rates different from the official one by the central bank.
The moves have done little to stop the bolivar’s fall.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s annual inflation at about 270%, the highest in the world and a sharp increase from the 180% rate it estimated in April.
For 2026, the outlook is even bleaker. The IMF forecasts Venezuela’s inflation to top 600% by next October.
The bolivar’s plunge can be partially explained by the US military’s show of force, as nervous Venezuelans seek to purchase hard currency as a hedge against an uncertain future. But that is only one of the causes, the consultants told CNN.
US sanctions against the Venezuelan oil sector, which is the nation’s largest source of foreign exchange by far, are also partially to blame.
In July, the Trump administration renegotiated a license authorizing Chevron, a major US oil company, to export Venezuelan crude. Under the new terms of the license, Chevron was authorized to pay fees and royalties to Venezuela in oil but not in cash, effectively reducing Chevron’s crude exports from the country by half, according to Reuters.
A spokesperson for Chevron said the company “operates globally in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to its business, as well as the sanctions frameworks provided for by the US government, including in Venezuela.”
The change has proved costly because Venezuela lost one of its few remaining sources of legitimate income. As a result, the government is now forced to sell even more oil on the black market at a discount to evade US government sanctions, one of the economists in Caracas told CNN.
To make up for the missing income, the government recently allowed private companies to sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for the depreciated bolivar, with exchange houses openly supported by a new crypto-managing regulator, the National Superintendence of Crypto Assets, known as Sunacrip.
Last year, Reuters reported that the government was preparing to increase usage of crypto assets in its oil exports to overcome the US sanctions. According to the specialized data collector Chainanalysis, Venezuela is second only to Brazil for crypto adoption rates in Latin America.
Today, thousands of Venezuelans – from corporate bankers to retirees – regularly purchase US dollars on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. It is even common to see shoppers at grocery stores trading currencies in the checkout lines.
Not everyone has embraced the new normal. “Sending money to Venezuela has always been a mess,” said Mejias, the architect in Colombia. “Now it’s even more confusing to understand what rate is good and what is not, and for old people like my parents, even more.”"
"Wait, I thought the economy was terrible. What happened?",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/economy/economy-jobs-earnings-ai,"Nov 20, 2025, 12:26 PM ET","Entering this week, the perception of America’s economy was overwhelmingly negative.
But after what, at least on the surface, appeared to be astronger-than-expected jobs reportand killer earnings fromNvidiaandWalmart– all within the span of about 18 hours – is it possible the economy is better than anyone thought?
It’s complicated. Let’s break it down.
America’s labor market started to stall out in the early summer. Between May and August, job gains averaged 31,000 per month, or about one-fifth the monthly rate seen last year. What happened in September – the report we just got after a seven-week delay – is a bit convoluted.
The preliminary job gains of 119,000 were more than double the 50,000 net increase economists were expecting. However, unemployment moved higher and the prior months’ employment picture turned murkier: The original payroll numbers for July (79,000) and August (22,000) were revised down to a gain of 72,000 and a loss of 4,000, respectively.
All told, the September job growth is a welcome sign that the labor market wasn’t collapsing heading into the shutdown, but the underlying trends haven’t changed much: It’s still a low-hire, low-fire slog with job growth limited to a handful of industries, leaving few opportunities for those who want jobs.
“I don’t know that anybody should be cheering about what we saw in the September jobs report,” Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, told CNN in an interview. “I think it’s a relief that it wasn’t worse and that it was (119,000) jobs added; but also remember, almost every number lately has been revised down.”
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said he remains concerned about the health of the job market – just as concerned as he was prior to Thursday’s report.
“The economy is struggling to create jobs. The unemployment rate is low but it’s now showing some stress,” Zandi said, adding that the closer the rate gets to 5%, the greater the risk of a “reinforcing negative cycle” that can cause a recession.
President Donald Trump and his administration have been under siege after the government shutdown, benefits cuts and Democratic election sweep earlier this month exposed what many Americans have been experiencing for years: the cost of living is too high, and consumers are increasingly fed up.
A poll published byFox Newsthis week showed 76% of Americans have a negative view of this economy, up from 67% in July. Only 15% of respondents said Trump’s policies are helping their financial situation, and 46% said they are hurting – a gap similar to polling at the end of former President Joe Biden’s term, right before voters booted Democrats from the White House.
People are making real changes to their spending habits:Home DepotandTargetposted worse-than-expected earnings earlier this week and slashed their forecasts, saying that consumers are making fewer visits and spending less when they shop.
Chipotle, Coca-Cola, Crocs and a host of other consumer brands have made similar comments: American households that bring in less than $100,000 are struggling with already high prices and still-stubborn inflation, and they are pulling back on spending. But people who earn more are more insulated, benefiting from a surging stock market and rising home values.
That so-calledK-shaped economyexplains some of the nuance in the overall state of the US economy – and why Walmart blew past Wall Street’s already-robust forecasts. Walmart said its fastest-growing segment of customers was made up of people earning more than $100,000 – those who were willing to spend money but were searching for value.
“People’s financial situations are getting squeezed,” Long said. “It’s harder to find work. And for people who have jobs, their income is not rising much faster than inflation. It’s this treading water feeling for the middle class right now, and that’s the part I don’t see changing.”
The stock market is decidedlynotalways representative of the broader economy, but its strength or weakness can influence how people perceive it. When fears of an AI bubble dragged down the stock market over the past several weeks, that weakness may have contributed to increasingly negative sentiment about the economy.
It started late last month when Palantir, a company that uses AI for government contract work, reported a weaker-than-expected forecast. AI stocks, which have propped up the broader market for several years, started to sink.
But that ended – at least for now – afterNvidia’s earningslate Wednesday proved that demand for its industry-leading AI chips hadn’t evaporated. In fact, demand has continued to surge. The company’s earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations, sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the broader market roaring back to life Thursday.
Wall Street basically has no idea. After the Dow gained 700 points earlier Thursday, it gave up all those gains and fell more than 200 points by midday. Even economists are confused.
“This morning’s employment report is adding more confusion than clarity to an exceedingly foggy backdrop,” said Mike Reid, RBC’s senior US economist.
That could complicate matters for the Federal Reserve. It may look at Thursday’s jobs data and earnings with a glass-half-full view and determine that the economy doesn’t need an interest-rate cut in December. That appeared to be the direction the Fed was heading anyway, afterOctober policy meeting minutesreleased on Wednesday showed deep skepticism about a December rate cut. But that could in turn could keep consumer loans like mortgages and auto loans high, too.
Alternatively, the Fed may look at the rising unemployment rate, overall hiring slowdown in the summer and weakness across multiple sectors and determine the economy needs some more juice. But that could exacerbate some of America’s inflation concerns.
Similarly, your personal financial situation influences how you view this economy. If you have a high-paying job in a field that’s relatively insulated from layoffs, you may be feeling great and spending a lot now. If you don’t… you probably aren’t.
Increasingly, people in the latter category arereallystruggling – going into serious debt and struggling to find work. That’s why the Trump administration is increasingly floating new policies like lowering housing costs,sending stimulus checksto American households and cutting tariffs. They’re controversial, and economists are split if they’d work, but they’re responsive to a growing wave of negativity.
It’s not clear how this all will shake out. The economy has had false alarms over the past several years. But what’s clear is many Americans hate this economy, and they’ll continue to hate it until they feel like they can afford things again."
Dow gains 500 points as Wall Street embraces robust corporate earnings,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/investing/us-stocks,"Oct 20, 2025, 2:27 PM ET","Wall Street kicked off a new week in high gear as optimism rose that the 20-day shutdown of the federal government could soon draw to a close.
National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC Monday he believes the shutdown is “likely to end sometime this week” and that the Trump administration would implement punitive new measures if Democrats in the Senate continue to hold out.
Traders are also feeling hopeful that the latest round of earnings reports will reveal positive corporate growth despite uncertainty in the economy. Around 86% of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far this quarter have beaten expectations, according to FactSet.
The Dow closed higher by 516 points on Monday, or 1.12%, partly fueled by shares of Apple (AAPL), which gained 3.94% and hit their first record high of the year after a report showed robust sales of the iPhone 17 model in the United States and China. The iPhone Air sold out in China just minutes after its launch,according to the South China Morning Post.
The S&P 500 gained 1.07%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.37%. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, sank 12%.
Markets took a nosedive earlier this month after President Donald Trump threatened to substantially raise tariffs on China after it pulled back on exports of its valuable rare earth minerals, which are required in the production of electronics. The Dowplunged by nearly 900 pointsOctober 10 on fears of an escalation in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. But Trump has since walked back those threats, noting that massive tariffs on China simply aren’t a sustainable option.

Investors now turn their focus to Big Tech: “The stock market’s next big test may be big tech earnings towards the end of October and into November, as investors will be looking for more clarity on how spending on artificial intelligence is leading to profitability,” wrote Rick Gardner, chief investment officer at RGA Investments.
The so-called Magnificent Seven stocks — Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) and Apple — have contributed 41% of the S&P’s gains this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

The shutdown is complicating the Fed’s ability to help the economy,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/economy/fed-interest-rates-govt-shutdown,"Oct 22, 2025, 1:14 PM ET","The Federal Reserve was already facing one of its most difficult battles, steering a shifting economy through a weakening labor market and stubborn inflation. The government shutdown just made that fight even harder.
To make determinations about its rate policy and other decisions to help the economy, the Fed relies heavily on official economic statistics that are collected and disseminated by the government. The shutdown has effectivelycut off access to that data— from the unemployment rate to retail sales — since the beginning of October.
With just one week to go before the Fed’s next decision on interest rates, officials are flying partially blind as they assess whether the labor market requires additional support, after data through August showedthe weakest pace of hiring since 2010and rising unemployment among young Americans and minorities.
It’s the latest wrinkle for policymakers as they tackle a continued attack from the Trump administration on their independence, an ongoing housing affordability crisis that the Fed doesn’t have all the tools to fix, the potential effects of AI, persistent inflation, uncertainty around tariffs and a slowdown in the job market.
In the absence of government data, Fed officials have turned to other sources to gauge the labor market and consumer spending — two important drivers of the US economy and the focus of the Fed’s so-called dual mandate to balance economic growth with keeping prices in check.
The problem is that government data is undisputedly the “gold standard” of how the world’s largest economy is measured. Without it, the Fed’s decision making is not fully informed. And the Fed might have even less access to private employment data this time around, after payroll software provider ADP ended its data-sharing agreement with the Fed in August, according toThe American Prospect.
“The risk is that the Fed misjudges where the state of its dual mandate sits, whether inflation or the labor market is the bigger concern,” Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at asset manager Glenmede, told CNN.
The last time Fed officials set monetary policy without key economic data was during the 2018-2019 shutdown. Minutes from the Fed’sJanuary 2019 meetingshowed how officials turned to figures on card transactions and vehicles sales in the absence of the Commerce Department’s monthly report on retail sales.
“I wouldn’t call it a data drought,” New York Fed President John Williams told the New York Times in an interview published on October 9.
“We’re still getting a significant amount of data,” he added, pointing to surveys from the Conference Board, the New York Fed and the Institute for Supply Management. Those surveys measure trends in prices, demand, production and overall economic activity.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday will release the Consumer Price Index for September, having recalled staff to ensure the report can be used as a basis forSocial Security’s annual cost-of-living adjustments.
Still, that leaves the Fed in the dark on the labor market’s true health and trajectory. Economists widely agree that private-sector figures cannot fully replace government data, especially considering that the government’s numbers serve as the benchmark for much of the private data.
With Social Security’s COLA on the line, the Trump administration plans to release inflation data delayed by the shutdown
The Fed’s main tool — its key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs more broadly — is particularly effective at making borrowing cheaper or more costly, depending on whether the Fed is trying to tamp down inflation or boost employment. So, it’s pretty good at changing how much consumers demand goods and services.
But it does nothing to balance the “supply” side of the supply and demand equation, which is precisely what continues to drive up prices in some parts of the country, such as the Northeast.
Sales of previously owned homes have been sluggish for the third-straight year, and persistently elevated mortgage rates have certainly played a role in keeping buyers on the sidelines. But so has the housing shortage.
“Sales of affordable homes are constrained by the lack of inventory,” National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement last month.
The Fed has already acknowledged that there’s only so much it can do to alleviate America’s housing woes.
“There is a long-term housing shortage,” Powell said in a news conference after the Fed’s July meeting. “This is not something the Fed can help with.”
President Donald Trump’s aggressive bid to reshape global trade has forced many businesses to put hiring plans on ice as they wait to see how everything plays out. And at the same time, many companies are actively trying to figure out how to implement AI into their operations.
The result: unusually weak hiring, largely driven by businesses feeling paralyzed. But for some workers, it’s also because of AI.
There’s no jobs report today. So here’s what we know about the US labor market
“The labor market has been frozen up because people are just having a hard time making decisions,” Laura Ullrich, an economist at Indeed, told CNN. “And AI is certainly having some impact on entry-level tech jobs.”
The Fed’s rate cuts should function like a tide that lifts all boats by making borrowing cheaper, allowing companies to expand head count. But that might not be enough to shore up demand for workers in roles that are increasingly being automated by AI.
Additionally, while the Fed is poised to lower rates further, “so long as economic uncertainty is high, it’s hard to know exactly how many people you should hire,” Ullrich said.
That sentiment is borne out by businesses in the manufacturing and services sectors surveyed by the Institute for Supply Management, who continue to express frustration over Trump’s significant policy changes and their ensuing effects on demand and planning.
“Client demand in professional services remains steady, though decision-making timelines are lengthening due to continued economic uncertainty and interest-rate concerns,” one business said in ISM’s September services survey.
The Fed is set to announce its latest monetary policy decision at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting ending on October 29, with a post-meeting news conference by Chair Jerome Powell scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ET that day."
"We’re in a ‘windchill’ economy, where things feel worse than they are",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/economy/affordability-economy-windchill,"Dec 9, 2025, 9:59 AM ET","Most Americans agree: Thiseconomy stinks.
Practically every consumer sentiment survey and political poll points to that theme. People feel like their dollars aren’t stretching as far as before, and the cost of living is rising beyond their means.
There’s just one problem: That part is not true.
Most Americans are getting raises that outpace overall inflation. It’s not even a new trend. It’s been happening each month since June 2023.
So, why do people feel so lousy about their finances if they’re getting wealthier?
A number of key factors are at play, and most of them are messing with our minds more than our wallets.
So this is the windchill economy: It feelsworse than it actually is. For many Americans, it’s deeply unpleasant.
The inflation crisis took a substantial toll on Americans’ wallets. Between March 2021 and June 2023, inflation outpaced paycheck growth – at times by a historic margin.
But the trend started to reverse in mid-2023, and folks have been making out better since then. Their raises started to outpace price hikes, and paychecks have fattened across all income groups – not just top earners.
That gap started to widen substantially toward the end of former President Joe Biden’s term and reached its most recent peak in April 2025, when paychecks grew 4.1% over the course of the previous 12 months, while prices rose just 2.3% over the same period.
But the gap has shrunk considerably over the past several months. Inflation stood at 3% in September, while wage gains came in at 3.8%. Median income for working-age Americans slowed near decade-long lows this year when adjusting for inflation,JPMorgan reported.
Even though American workers are still ahead, they can see inflation creeping ever closer in the rearview mirror. The overall feeling that dollars aren’t stretching quite as far as they used to isn’t quite backed up in the data, but it’s starting to feel that way as prices are on the rise again.
During the pandemic, millions of Americans got their first taste of financial security. They weren’t spending on travel, gas, restaurants and a number of other items. Their savings were padded by what they weren’t spending – and Americans got an additional boost through historic government stimulus.
Pay exceeded inflation by record margins: In May 2020, average wages grew 7.5% over the previous 12 months, when inflation stood at just 0.1%. For a year, Americans gained substantial purchasing power. “Revenge spending” became a social media trend, and consumer confidence surged.
With ample savings and hefty raises, folks expected that they would make enough money to achieve the American Dream. But when the pandemic shifted into an inflation crisis, Americans discovered that the game had changed.
The housing market locked up, and the last bastions of cheap housing in America are gone: Boomers weren’t downsizing, starter homes were going for hundreds of thousands of dollars over asking price, million-dollar homes in middle-class towns became commonplace, and mortgage rates started to rise.
The wage-inflation calculus flipped, and during inflation’s peak in June 2022, prices rose 9.1% over the course of the previous 12 months – a four-decade high – wages grew only 4.8%.
The good vibes wore off – quickly. Robust spending growth that had carried into 2023 fell off a cliff and is now just treading water.
“People across the income spectrum were spending; they were living a pretty good life,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “And then you can see the straight decline for the bottom 80% for the vast majority of America.”
The financial security many Americans thought they could achieve feels even more distant than before they got their raises several years ago.
Even though pay gains are exceeding overall inflation, the particular prices that are gaining fastest are among the most painful for Americans to absorb.
Food, electricity, child care, home prices and rent have all outpaced wage gains over the course of the ’20s. Those items all have a common theme: They’re regular expenses that you can’t avoid.
Americans’ wages have gained 29% this decade. But grocery prices and child care both rose 30% over the past five years. Electricity is up 38%. Rent is up 30% and home prices have surged 55%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
You can decide not to buy a new TV or go on a trip. You can rein in your holiday spending – andmany Americans have. But if the necessities are getting more expensive, that stings even more.
Just as prices are not all created equal, financial situations are wildly different, too. For wealthier Americans who have money in the booming stock market and equity in their home, they’ve gained significant financial security over the past few years. That’s not true for lower-income Americans, a rapidly growing share of whom are living paycheck to paycheck.
Bank of America’s deposit data illustrates that divide: Higher-income households’ paychecks grew 4% year-over-year in November — the highest since October 2021 and well above the 3% inflation rate. But middle-income households’ paychecks gained just 2.3% and lower-income households’ wages were up only 1.4% – half the pace of inflation.
Although Bank of America’s data hasn’t yet shown up in broader economic data, there’s ample evidence that lower-income Americans are struggling. Multiple prominent retailers that cater to middle-class and low-income Americans have said customers are visiting less and spending fewer dollars when they shop. That trend continued during the beginning of the holiday shopping season.
But Walmart and Costco, which appeal to middle-class Americans looking for value, are surging.
“This is the Costco economy,” said Long. “People need to save.”"

Why this analyst says the AI bubble is 17 times bigger than the dot-com bust,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/18/business/ai-bubble-analyst-nightcap,"Oct 18, 2025, 3:00 AM ET","A version of this story will appear in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.
At this point, even the concept of an “AI bubble” seems to be a bubble. (In fact, Deutsche Bank analysts said last month that the“AI bubble” bubblehas already burst.)
Perhaps some corners of the internet are bored of the bubble talk. That’s not making the market any less, um, bubbly.
Just this week,the Financial Timeswrote that 10 AI startups — not a dollar in profit among them — have gained nearly $1 trillion in market value over the past 12 months. (That is, to use a technical term,bananas.)
Even as Wall Street analysts and tech media increasingly question the hype, drawinguneasy comparisons to the late 1990s, the AI industry’s response has been to shrug and watch their valuations tick higher and higher. The AI faithful believe the technology will disrupt (in a good way, hopefully!) virtually every aspect of modern life, from phone operating systems to pharmaceuticals to finance. And even if there is a bubble, proponents say, the dot-com bubble gave us companies like Amazon, and the internet became, well, the internet.
Yet another OpenAI financial entanglement is renewing fears of a repeat of the dot-com era
There are plenty of skeptics countering the AI hype machine, though few professional market analysts have done so as stridently as Julien Garran, a researcher and partner at the UK firm MacroStrategy Partnership.
Earlier this month, Garran published a report claiming that we are in “the biggest and most dangerous bubble the world has ever seen.” Garran concludes that there is a “misallocation of capital in the US” that makes the current frenzy 17 times bigger than the dot-com bubble and four times bigger than the 2008 real-estate bubble.
That is, needless to say, a bold claim about a phenomenon that is famously hard to predict.
I sat down (virtually) with Garran earlier this week to talk bubbles and why he thinks the AI fervor is, to quote his report, not just “a bit bad” but rather “the antithesis of socio-economic progress.”
The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Nightcap: Your latest AI report made a lot of waves among finance and tech media junkies like myself. Can you walk me through the top lines?
At the heart of the note is a golden rule I’ve developed, which is that if you use large language model AI to create an application or a service, it can never be commercial.
One of the reasons is the way they were built. The original large language model AI was built using vectors to try and understand the statistical likelihood that words follow each other in the sentence. And while they’re very clever, and it’s a very good bit of engineering required to do it, they’re also very limited.
The second thing is the way LLMs were applied to coding. What they’ve learned from — the coding that’s out there, both in and outside the public domain — means that they’re effectively showing you rote learned pieces of code. That’s, again, going to be limited if you want to start developing new applications.
And the third set of problems, in terms of how it’s built, is around the idea of scaling. There’s a real problem at a certain point in terms of how much you have to spend to improve them. I’d say it’s definite that (developers) have hita scaling wall. Otherwise they’d be releasing demonstrably better and better models each time they came to came to market with a new product. And since ChatGPT 4 came out in March of 2023, theyhaven’t actually raisedthe bar significantly.
Nightcap: What about the argument that ChatGPT, while not perfect, is capable of doing some low-level grunt work could increase productivity?
Garran:There are certain bullsh*t jobs out there — some parts of management, consultancy, jobs where people don’t check if you’re getting it right or don’t know if you’ve got it right. So you can argue that you can replace bullsh*t with bullsh*t, and, yes, OK, I’m prepared to accept that you probably can, but that doesn’t really make it more broadly useful.
Nightcap: So how should regular people think about all the huge sums of money churning through the industry?
Garran:The AI ecosystem can’t really sustain itself. You have Nvidia making a ton of money … Anybody else — the data centers, the the LLM developers, the software developers that use LLMs — they’re all heavily loss-making.
Consequently, to maintain the process, you need to have a continued funding, which is why it looks like apermanent funding tour.But despite all of this, there’s no obvious way that they actually turn this around to a profit. It’s hope over realistic expectation … When you run out of investors, then the whole thing is going to roll over.
Nightcap: Are investors actually pulling back?
Garran:The amount of (venture capital) willingness to fund some of these startups, especially the software developers, is beginning to diminish because they’re valued so highly. That leaves you with with basically SoftBank, which has had toraise a lot of debtagainst its shares to fund the first tranche of the OpenAI commitment that it made, and it’s still got a bigger second tranche to fund.
You’ve got foreign states like, say, Saudi Arabia. But there aren’t many countries who have unlimited spending power. And that then leaves Nvidia as sort of last man standing.
Nightcap: Are we in the process of deflating, or is the bubble still growing?
Garran:With AI, I can’t say it’s starting to deflate. We’re just a week past all-time highs, so it’d be kind of arrogant to say that was definitely the top. But it’s certainly drawing closer.
Nightcap: I have to ask, because I ask myself this all the time: What if you’re wrong? What if the hype is real?
Garran:Well, there are two ways I’d be wrong.
One is, it just takes longer to break than I thought. Which, to be honest, it already has. And what happens if I’m wrong in that way, is simply that they continue building things that aren’t fundamentally useful to the economic society.
If it carries on for another year or another two years because they managed to persuade someone to provide funding, the more people are doing stuff that’s not going to make a return. The future is not going to be as bright. Future (gross domestic product) will be lower than it would be if they didn’t do this stuff, and they just went about doing some mundane things that people actually valued.
And if I’m completely wrong… (and) someone could come up with “superintelligence,” well, that completely changes the world, and we’d be depending on whoever controlled the systems. We could be in a utopia of sorts, or we could be in “Brave New World.” Or we could be in a utopia like “Player Piano,” the Kurt Vonnegut book where everyone’s employed, apart from some people living in their ivory towers.
To be honest, I think that is beyond our current capability as an industrial society to pull it off. If that starts changing, then I’ll change my mind very quickly. I just haven’t seen it."
Wall Street is relying on the Supreme Court to protect the Fed. Is that wishful thinking?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/29/business/wall-street-fed-supreme-court,"Nov 29, 2025, 3:00 AM ET","Wall Street barely blinked at President Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve this year. But its confidence could be shaken with an upcoming Supreme Court ruling.
Trump has launched an intense pressure campaign against the Fed during his second term, frequently demanding interest-rate cuts and threatening to fire Chair Jerome Powell. The central bank has lowered interest rates twice this year, in September and October, and has another opportunity to cut rates in December.
Yet investors remain confident in the Fed’s ability to fight inflation — at least according to measures such as long-term interest rates on US Treasuries and inflation expectations.
Their faith hinges on a Supreme Court case overTrump’s efforts to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor.
If Trump wins, the Fed’s vaunted independence to set interest rates without political interference could crumble.
But Wall Street seems to believe the Supreme Court will ultimately opt to keep the central bank independent. Markets also seem to believe that none of the names floated to succeed Powell as Fed chair when his term ends in May pose a threat in that regard, either.
“For now, Wall Street is very comfortable with Fed independence,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at financial services firm DA Davidson.
Just three days after Trump said he fired Cook in August — the first time a president has tried to fire a Fed governor in the central bank’s near-112-year history — the S&P 500 closed at a record high as other major stock indexes pushed higher.
Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, a benchmark used for the rates on various loans, has steadily declined since the spring, when Trump began to threaten firing Powell. That means investors don’t see interest rates getting out of control in the next decade, a sign of confidence in the Fed.
Indeed, long-term market-based inflation expectations, which capture Wall Street’s faith in the Fed’s ability to fight price increases, have remained in check throughout the year.
But fears of growing government deficits have driven up so-called term premiums, the extra yield investors demand for holding long-term bonds over shorter ones. Investors say concerns about Fed independence have also played a role — albeit a minor one — in the uptick.
The court has scheduled oral arguments in late January to determine whether Trump has the power to fire Cook. The president has cited unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The Justice Department is investigating, but she has not been charged. Earlier this month, Cook’s lawyers said the allegations are “baseless” andurged the department to drop its inquiry.
In a separate case in May, the justices said in an unsigned opinion that Trumpcould keep Gwynne Wilcox, whom he fired from the National Labor Relations Board, off the NLRB while she continues fighting in court to reverse her termination.
But SCOTUS specifically said thatdecision doesn’t impact the Fed.
“Markets took a great deal of comfort from that,” Randall Kroszner, a former Fed governor, said at a central banking conference on October 31 hosted by the Peterson Institute for Economics (PIIE). He said investors “believe that the Supreme Court will take a reasonable and balanced approach” in the Cook case.
Investors are also closely watching Trump’s nomination of the next Fed chair. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led the search, revealeda shortlist of five peoplefrom the White House, the Fed and the private sector. The list includes National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett as well as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.
Bessent told CNBC recently that Trump’s announcement could come around Christmas.
“Markets still seem to be fairly confident Fed independence will prevail, and I think this is in part because of the names that we saw for Fed chairman were reasonable,” Francesco Bianchi, an economics professor and monetary policy scholar at Johns Hopkins University, said at the PIIE conference."
Why the crypto market is crashing,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/24/business/why-the-crypto-market-is-crashing,"Nov 24, 2025, 4:26 PM ET","Even bycrypto standards, it’s been a rough few weeks.
Investors in digital assets are accustomed to extreme volatility, but a $1 trillion wipeout over the past six weeks has tested even crypto’s diehard believers and alienated many of its newest converts.
Bitcoin, the industry bellwether, has fallen dramatically since early October, when it hit a record high of $126,000. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency dipped below $81,000 on Friday before recovering slightly over the weekend. On Monday, as the broader stock market rallied, bitcoin topped $88,000, rising nearly 2% over a 24-hour period. (Crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.)
It is shaping up to be one of crypto’s worst months on record, and it’s not clear the market has bottomed out.
Why crypto briefly but dramatically crashed when Trump renewed his trade war
“Whether Bitcoin stabilizes after this correction remains uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote Monday. “Unlike prior crashes, driven primarily by retail speculation, this year’s downturn has occurred amid substantial institutional participation, policy developments, and global macro trends.”
While crypto’s fate has broadly mirrored the stock market’s in recent years, its current angst runs deeper. That’s largely thanks to an influx of mainstream money that behaves very differently from the funds controlled by a typical crypto investor.
Bitcoin is in a bear market, having dropped 30% from its most recent high, while the S&P 500 is down just 3% from its most recent peak. It is on track for its worst month since the 2022 crypto “winter” that culminated in the collapse ofSam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.
Anxiety is coursing through stocks and crypto for two key reasons: Investors are fretting overthe Federal Reserve’s next rate cut, and they’re worrying about whether AI is abubblethat’ll blow up in their faces.
All of that weighs on crypto traders because digital assets, like tech stocks, are especially sensitive to changes in the Fed’s benchmark rate, which affects the cost of borrowing money and can quickly sap investor appetite for risk.
But crypto investors have an additional hangover to deal with following anOctober 10 flash crash. When President Donald Trump reignited his trade war with China that day, it prompted a wave of panic-selling that triggered automatic liquidations across the highly leveraged crypto market. In a single day, the flash crashed wiped out $19 billion worth of crypto. For a lot of folks, the stomach-churning crash was all the motivation they needed to exit crypto completely, and that’s left bitcoin and other tokens more susceptible to volatility.
The flash crash forced many investors sell their holdings to meet margin calls. That tends to have a snowball effect: The more bitcoin falls, the more calls investors face from their brokerages, the more they have to sell their bitcoin (and other holdings) to cover their positions.
What makes this crypto crash different is the presence of billions of dollars that have entered the crypto market through spot bitcoin funds that US regulators approved last year.
Mainstream investors got into crypto to enjoy the ride up, but they don’t have the same level of devotion to the ideology as early adopters who are bolstered by intense online communities encouraging one another to buy the dip and keep the faith.
“The bottom line is, bitcoin is for normies now,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told me. “As a result, the normies are going to view it as another speculative holding in their portfolio … it’s going to be treated like a volatile mainstream investment.”"
"K-shaped economy and inflation boost Black Friday sales by 4.1% from last year, online spending jumps 9.1%",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/29/business/black-friday-us-econony-spending,"Nov 29, 2025, 4:32 PM ET","US retail sales on Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, climbed 4.1% compared with last year, according to data released Saturday by Mastercard SpendingPulse. Online shoppers alonespent $11.8 billion, up 9.1% from 2024, according to data collection platform Adobe Analytics.
But those gains don’t account for higher prices due toinflation, so actual spending could be flat.
“We have 3% inflation, so maybe (the 4.1% increase in spending) is a real increase of just 1% or so, which is not that much of an increase,” Rick Newman, who writes The Pinpoint Press, a newsletter on the US economy, told CNN on Friday.
There’s also a bifurcation in who’s spending. The Federal Reserve’s most recent Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes about the economy, showed consumer spending among low- and middle-income consumers is on the decline. Meanwhile, the Fed found high-end consumers are continuing to spend — including on luxury items and travel.
Consumers have bought fewer items this holiday season, but the average selling prices are higher, according to Claudia Lombana, a national consumer expert.
“The ones that have higher income are spending at will, but those who are less affluent are budgeting,” Lombana told CNN’s Omar Jimenez on Saturday.
It’s part of the so-called K-shaped economy, in which higher earners get a boost from their stock market investments and home valuations and use their fatter paychecks to spend. But lower earnersincreasingly live paycheck to paycheckand look for discounts — or curtail their spending to cope with rising prices.
“The story of the economy right now is it’s a bifurcated economy. If you’re lucky enough to own stocks and own a home, you’re part of the upper slant of that cave, that K-shaped economy … you’re going to be comfortable spending a fair amount of money this year,” Newman said.
But Newman added that people on the lower slant of the K — those who don’t own stocks or a home — are increasingly worried about job security.
“I think those people are going to be pinching pennies this holiday season,” he said, adding that they will be more frugal with gift purchases and necessities.Heating bills, for instance, are higher because of natural gas prices going up. Andgrocery pricesare on the rise, while rent hikes outpace income growth, he noted.
Eighty-five percent of consumersexpect higher pricesbecause of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, according to the National Retail Federation, or NRF. And it’s a factor in how they shop.
“Nobody is sort of going on an item-by-item basis and saying, ‘Oh, the Trump tariffs have pushed up costs here by 4% or 10%,’ but it’s on people’s minds,” Newman said.
Value is more important than ever these days for consumers. Consumer sentiment is glum, job growth has slowed, and the federal government shutdown forced low-income shoppers to pull back spending amid a pause in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funding.
As goods and services become harder for everyday Americans to afford, shoppers have grown pickier about how they spend their money and hunt for deals. They are gravitating toward retailers they feel can help them stretch their dollars further on groceries, household essentials, clothing and electronics.
Chains such as Walmart, TJ Maxx, Gap and others are benefiting, reporting strong sales during their latest quarters. Walmart is now gaining market share against competitors across all income groups and in several merchandise categories.
But others, such as Target and Bath & Body Works, are struggling.
And people are splurging less on gifts for themselves, according to Bath & Body Works.
Shoppers are expected to continue tosplash out this holiday season, despite the cost-of-living squeeze and other economic pressures. The NRF expects retail sales in November and December to grow 3.7% to 4.2% compared with a year ago. That growth would be similar to last year’s rise.
The NRF projects arecord $1 trillion in holiday spendingthis year, up from $976 billion last year.
Spending growth on apparel grew 6.1% online and 5.4% in-store on Black Friday, with Mastercard suggesting that “shoppers refreshed wardrobes while leaning into value-driven choices and convenience.” Consumers spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving, up 5.3% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics, asbig deals drew them to shop online.
“The magnitude of discounts was the big story on Thanksgiving yesterday, as retailers leaned into delivering great deals to drive consumer demand online,” Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe, said in a statement Friday.
Meanwhile, “buy now, pay later” continues to be an important payment option for consumers this holiday season. Adobe forecasts $20.2 billion will be spent through the payment method from November 1 to December 31, an 11% uptick over 2024.
“We saw half the people in America already shopping by Halloween this year for the holiday period,” said Lombana. “Of course, this five-day period from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday is significant for retailers, both online and in store. We are expecting to see Cyber Monday deliver strong.”
She noted that “consumers are definitely being more cautious, but during the holidays, they also want to engage in the holiday spirit.”"
The Fed’s newest governor brings a Trump perspective on the economy. Is anyone buying it?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/09/economy/stephen-miran-fed-perspective,"Nov 9, 2025, 3:00 AM ET","The Federal Reserve’s newest policymaker has an unconventional perspective on the US economy that’s proving tough to sell.
In September, President Donald Trump appointed Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to temporarily fill a vacated seat on the Fed’s powerful Board of Governors. So far, Miran has participated in two Fed meetings — and broken ranks with the vast majority of Fed officials each time.
At the central bank’s October policy meeting, Miran dissented from Fed officials’ decisionto lower interest rates by a quarter point, backing a larger, half-point cut instead, just as he did in September.
He hasn’t wasted any time to leave a first impression in other ways, too.
In his first month as a central banker, Miran spoke publicly about the US economy at more than a dozen events and media interviews. Fed officials typically do only about a handful of public engagements in their first month.
Like Trump, Miran hasrepeatedly called for aggressive interest rate cuts. He has argued that borrowing costs are exerting more pressure on the economy than most think and that there’s “substantial disinflation” coming down the pike — views Miran proclaims as “out of consensus.”
He reiterated his stance in a Wednesday interview with Yahoo Finance.
Not everyone is sold on Miran’s takes on the economy.
“I certainly wouldn’t characterize anything that he’s saying as ridiculous,” David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura, said in an interview with CNN after he moderated a discussion with Miran in Washington, DC. “It’s more of a debate on the inputs that he’s putting into his economic modeling, which are controversial.”
“I think only time will tell if he ends up being right,” Seif said.
There’s no ‘material inflation from tariffs,’ says new central banker Stephen Miran
Miran’s rationale for significant rate cuts is mostly based on how he views Trump’s sweeping economic policies andhis expectation that Trump’s tariffs won’t stoke inflation.
In his first big speech after being sworn in as a Fed governor, Miran explained how Trump’s policies may be contributing to a lower “neutral rate of interest,” which is a theoretical level of borrowing costs that neither stimulates nor dampens the US economy.
Miran specifically pointed to the administration’s aggressive crackdown on immigration, the president’s signature tax and spending bill passed by Congress earlier this year, and Trump’s widespread tariffs.
In Miran’s view, that means the Fed has a lot of catching up to do to bring rates back to a more neutral level, and he believes time is of the essence.
“If you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,” he told The New York Times in an interview that published on November 1. “I don’t see a reason to run that risk if I’m not concerned about inflation on the upside.”
Additionally, Miran has said the ongoing mass deportations should take some pressure off the housing market, further lowering rates and resulting in “substantial disinflation.” He has also frequently downplayed the potential impacts of tariffs on consumer prices.
Miran, who earned a PhD in economics from Harvard University, is still widely seen as a serious economist, but his ideas have had some pushback.
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was critical last month of Miran’s debut speech as a Fed governor.
“I cannot remember an analytically weaker speech given before the New York Economic Club or given by a Fed governor,” Summers told Bloomberg. “If this was the best case for the radical reduction in interest rates that President Trump has been advocating, then that case is even weaker than I had previously supposed.”
Some Wall Street economists also haven’t been impressed by Miran’s takes.
“We find some of his arguments questionable, others incomplete and almost none persuasive,”Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients in late September.
Miran’s distinct economic reasoning also doesn’t seem to have gained traction with his colleagues on the Fed’s rate-setting committee.
Like other Trump appointees, such as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, Miran agrees that a weaker labor market is at risk of falling off a cliff. But neither Waller nor Bowman have voted for a half-point rate cut, nor have they suggested that the neutral rate is lower than widely understood.
Fed Governor Lisa Cook, inher first speech since Trump said he fired her,  was asked last week how she views the interaction between lower immigration and housing inflation, which is a cornerstone of Miran’s economic views.
She subtly rejected that premise, stating “when I’m thinking about immigration, I’m typically thinking about the labor market.”
“I think that that’s the major role that I see in immigration policy,” she said."
The global AI race is supercharging Taiwan’s economy. But many don’t feel better off,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/28/economy/taiwan-ai-economy-intl-hnk,"Nov 28, 2025, 3:36 AM ET","For proof that an economy can thrive even under constant military threats from a powerful neighbor and amid US President Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, look no further than Taiwan.
The self-ruled democracy has logged roughly 8% economic growth for two consecutive quarters, a rare achievement for a developed economy and one that is projected to push its 2025 GDP growth close to 7.4%, even surpassing China’s.
“Taiwan’s economy has clearly been one of the best performing economies in the world, particularly over recent quarters,” said Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics. “Many people expected Taiwan’s economy to benefit from the sort of AI boom, but maybe many underestimated to what extent it would do.”
Taiwan’s statistics bureau on Friday reported8.21%year-on-year growth in GDPin the third quarter, driven by a 36.5% surge in exports in the period ending September. This followed an already striking 7.7% expansion in the second quarter.
In October, exports hit a record high, climbing 49.7% from a year earlier – the largest single month increase in over 15 years.
To top it all off, Taiwan’s stock market overtook Germany’s in September as the world’s eighth largest, riding on the global frenzy for artificial intelligence.
But even as Taiwan’s economy flourishes, driven by the outsized influence of its high-tech sector as exemplified by the world-beating chipmaker TSMC, many citizens have been unable to share in the boom, as income gaps widen and wages remain stagnant.
Economists say a key reason is that the gains are highly concentrated. Electronics manufacturing accounts for more than 15% of GDP but employs just 6.5% of the workforce, according to Capital Economics.
This unevenness is partly reflected in sluggish consumer spending. Consumer confidence has remained subdued throughout the year, according to theindex released by the Research Center of Taiwan Economic Development. Trump’s trade war has also dampened sentiment, economists say, particularly as Taiwan has yet to finalize a trade agreement with Washington.
“From my perspective as a salaried worker earning above the median income, I feel the economy isn’t actually doing that well,” said Vivian Chen, a nurse in the Southern port city of Kaohsiung.
Chen’s observations are echoed by many in the home of the global chip powerhouse. Taiwan’s GDP per capita is forecast to exceed $38,000 this year, outpacing South Korea and Japan. But its average wage lags both countries by at least 30%, according to CNN’s calculations of official data.
Taiwan’s tech prowess, built over decades in the chip and electronics industries, has positioned the island to benefit from the AI boom. As tech giants from Google and OpenAI to Microsoft rush to build data centers powered by graphics processing units designed by Nvidia and AMD, Taiwanese companies have been at the forefront, manufacturing the semiconductors and servers essential for training AI models.
In one prominent example, TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker that supplies Nvidia and is known by locals as the “protector of the nation,” has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range, driven by the explosive growth in AI, after surpassing sales expectations in previous quarters.
Meanwhile, Taiwan’s outbound shipments to the US, where most of the AI data center expansions have occurred, have grown more than 63% in the first 10 months of this year, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of Finance.
But questions have mounted about the sustainability of this export-driven boom, especially amid concerns that the AI frenzy could cool.
Taiwan’s export growth “will definitely come down next year,” said Wang Jiann-Chyuan, vice president of the semi-official thinktank Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research. He expects growth to retreat from about 30% in recent quarters to single digits, as this year’s surge makes further expansion harder.
Adding to the uncertainty is Trump, Wang said. Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US hit a record this year, raising the risk of scrutiny from a president who has made reducing trade deficits a central goal of his tariff campaign.
So far, chips and electronics, which made up more than 73% of Taiwan’s exports, have been spared from the levy. While Trump has repeatedly threatened triple-digit tariffs on semiconductors, he has exempted companies, including TSMC, that build manufacturing facilities in the United States.
Still, the heavy concentration of exports in the high-tech sector has amplified concerns about over-reliance on a single industry — or even a single company. While chips and electronics now account for nearly three-quarters of exports, up from roughly half five years ago, traditional sectors such as metals, machinery, and plastics have seen little growth or outright decline.
For Wu Jieh-min, a researcher at Taiwan’s top research institute Academia Sinica, however, part of the concern about the island’s economic future are associated with many Taiwanese people’s deep-seated insecurity about its political status. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to absorb it by force, if necessary.
“I think the cautious, on-edge mindset you see across Taiwanese society is very obvious, and I actually see it as something positive,” said Wu, whose research focuses on political economy and sociology.
“We have to manage our own future very carefully, because even just surviving is already difficult for us,” he said.
On the ground, some Taiwanese say the rosy headline figures don’t reflect their daily lives, like Chen, the nurse, who said salaries for health professionals feel stagnant.
“That’s why you hear doctors complaining about being underpaid, and why so many nurses are leaving the country or the industry altogether,” Chen said.
“People in Taiwan keep hyping themselves up, saying things like ‘We have TSMC,’ or boasting about how high the stock market is. But for many living here, their monthly pay stayed much the same,” she added.
GT Lin, an AI engineer in Taipei, echoed that sentiment.
“That’s why I’ve come to the conclusion that the country is strong, but the people aren’t necessarily wealthy,” he said.
Taiwan’s real wage growth, adjusted for inflation, began to slow in the late 1990s and has remained stagnant since the early 2000s. Labor’s share of GDP peaked at about 50% in the 1990s and has since fallen to around 44%.
Roy Ngerng, a Singaporean labor activist based in Taipei who has written extensively about the issue of wage stagnation in Taiwan, attributed the problem to long-term wage suppression — aimed at boosting export competitiveness.
He said that while Taiwan’s economy has seen exceptional growth in recent years – and booming profits among tech businesses – average workers and employees in other sectors have been mostly left out, widening the income disparity.
Just five years ago, wages in the electronics sector were already 35% above the economy-wide average, according to Capital Economics. Now they are more than 70% higher.
Ngerng added that the current government has been steadily increasing the minimum wage.
Wu Tsong-Min, an economist at National Taiwan University, however, notes that wage stagnation is “not unique to Taiwan,” as many advanced economies face similar issues, particularly among low-skill workers.
Wu, the author of “A 400-Year History of Taiwan’s Economy,” also pointed out that Taiwan’s GDP per capita, after adjusted for purchasing power, rises further thanks to lower domestic prices.
Still, housing remains a major burden: Taipei’s house price-to-income ratio has nearly tripled in the past two decades, surpassing London, New York and even Hong Kong, according to theGlobal Property Guide.
For Wu of Academia Sinica, he remains “cautiously optimistic,” saying that the thriving tech industry could generate spillover effects that trickle down to other sectors, even though the effects remain to be seen.
“Taiwan’s economy wasn’t shaped by deliberate planning or an exceptionally capable government, but rather an evolutionary process,” he said.
While the size of Taiwan’s economy is dwarfed by leading global powers, Wu added, its small and medium-sized enterprises are nimble, adaptable and attuned to global trends.
“That’s how its semiconductor industry became what it is today.”"
America’s job market is turning into an exclusive airport lounge,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/economy/us-jolts-job-openings-october-september,"Dec 9, 2025, 10:20 AM ET","In aK-shaped economywhere the “have-nots” areincreasingly falling behind the “haves﻿,” the labor market is trending toward a similar fate.
Job opportunities didn’t shrink as feared in October as holiday staffing needs lifted openings to a five-month high, new shutdown-delayed data showed Tuesday. However, the latest official look atemployment trendsshowed that there’s still a deep chill running down the spine of the US economy.
Hiring continued to stall, layoff activity picked up, and employees clung to their jobs with white knuckles: The voluntary quits rate (a closely watched indicator of worker confidence) fell to a five-year low, according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
“The labor market is becoming a much more exclusive club,” said Noah Yosif, chief economist at the American Staffing Association, told CNN in an interview Tuesday. “Those on the inside, they’re doing pretty well; but for those on the outside, it’s getting harder and harder to break in.”
“And if that is to continue in the long term, the inability for those folks on the outside to hold down a steady paycheck could cause more severe ramifications for the economy,” he added.
What is the k-shaped economy?
Tuesday’s report, which includes September and October JOLTS data, is the latest in a long pipeline of federal economic reports that were delayed and disrupted by the historic federal shutdown’s negative effect on statistical agencies’ abilities to collect, process, analyze and disseminate crucial data.
It’s the first labor market release for October from the BLS and the most up-to-date official look at the job market for Federal Reserve policymakers, who are currently meeting to consider their next move on rates. (A policy announcement is due at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday.)
The BLS’JOLTS reportis a closely watched indicator of labor turnover, providing the trajectory of how much businesses say they’re looking to hire (openings); how much they’re actually adding to their workforce (hires); to what extent they’re cutting back on their workforce (layoffs); and to what extent people are voluntarily leaving their jobs (quits).
That churn is needed for a healthy labor market (and healthy economy).
“The labor market depends on dynamism,” Yosif said. “The dynamism of the labor market is really what determines whether not only employers are able to find the best candidates for their work, but also what determines whether employees are able to find the best opportunities for them and, of course, earn a steady paycheck to contribute to the economy.”
However, for much of this year, the US labor market has lost its momentum. And despite the elevated tally of estimated job openings seen Tuesday, that trend held true in September and October.
When theAugust JOLTS report was releasedon the eve of what would become the longest-ever shutdown, job openings as a share of total employment remained at a five-year low.
There was a solid rebound in September, Tuesday’s data showed, as the number of available jobs picked up from 7.23 million in August to 7.66 million. In October, they ticked higher to 7.67 million.
However, the elevated level of openings appeared to be largely driven by businesses gearing up for the holiday shopping season: Trade industries (wholesale, retail and transportation) saw the biggest jumps in job postings in October, JOLTS data showed.
The hiring outlook was even more dour: Very few industries added jobs. Aside from a bump among some services firms, hiring was flat if not down across most sectors.
A first look at November hiring shows the private sector lost 32,000 jobs
“Where employers really put their money where their mouth is, is when it comes to hiring,” Yosif said. “And unfortunately, we haven’t really seen much of an uptick in hiring.”
The estimated level of hires as well as the rate of hiring (as a percentage of total employment) picked up in September from August; however, they both dropped off again in October. The hires rate returned to one of its lowest points seen in more than a decade, BLS data shows.
To anyone on theoutside looking in, that’s unwelcome news.
“There’s no holiday cheer for job seekers,” Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote Tuesday. “While it’s encouraging job openings ticked up in October, it’s hard to get too excited until firms start hiring people.”
Layoffs increased in September as well as October, landing at the highest level since January 2023. However, the rate of layoffs is about where it was heading into the pandemic.
In thislow-hire, low-fire labor marketenvironment where it’s taking jobseekers an average of six months to find work, those who have employment are holding on to what they have, Tuesday’s report showed.
Quits fell to their lowest levels since May 2020, when the pandemic rocked the economy.
For now, the US economy can withstand the dwindling momentum in the jobs market, Yosif said, noting a shift in the “breakeven rate” of employment. Put simply, the economy doesn’t need to create as many jobs as it once did to sustain itself.
“Back in 2023, the breakeven rate for the economy was about 250,000 jobs every month, but now that’s dropped to about [30,000] to 40,000 jobs per month,” he said, noting that the year-to-date job gains well outpace that breakeven point.
However, he cautioned, the bigger question starts to become, “Who is having access to these opportunities.”
“The stagnant labor market is really having a disproportionate impact on the young and financially vulnerable workers,” he said. “The economy can definitely withstand this lack of momentum for a good amount of time, but it’s the people who are really getting crushed by the stagnant labor market whose effects are going to be felt more acutely.”
A clearer snapshot of employment activity will be available the morning of December 16 when the BLS releases the November jobs report. The shutdown-delayed release also will include partial data for October (payroll estimatesbut not survey-drawn datasuch as the unemployment rate or demographic data)."
The world’s biggest company just told everyone to chill out,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/22/tech/ai-bubble-fears-nvidia-earnings,"Nov 22, 2025, 3:00 AM ET","Concerns about an AI bubble have been simmering forat least a year and a half.Nvidia’s incredibly strong earnings this past week tried to put those fears to bed. It may not have been enough.
Nvidia on Wednesdayposted sales and profitsup more than 60% year-on-year, stronger than Wall Street had projected. CEO Jensen Huang said “sales are off the charts.” And the company expects fourth quarter revenue of around $65 billion, once again ahead of Wall Street’s projections.
Nvidia executives said these results, along with growth from other major AI players and thebillions being poured into AI infrastructure, indicate that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.
“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” Huang said on a call with analysts Wednesday. “From our vantage point, we see something very different.”
Nvidia beats earnings expectations, even as bubble concerns mount
Some Wall Street analysts agree.But the wider market is not yet convinced: After briefly ticking up on Thursday morning following Nvidia’s report, the chipmaker’s shares (NVDA) dipped back into the red. They closed Friday down 1%, although the stock remains up 29% from the start of this year.
In other words, Nvidia answered a lot of questions about where the industry stands right now, but it may take more to shift the overall AI narrative.
Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company anticipates $3 trillion to $4 trillion in annual AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade, adding that demand “continues to exceed our expectations.” Already, tech giants are expected to pour $400 billion into AI-related capital expenditures this year, to meet what they say is growing demand for AI and cloud services but also to avoid falling behind industry rivals.
Nvidia has every reason to try to reassure investors — expectations for the company are sky-high after nearly two years of astronomical growth. And many look to the chipmaker as a bellwether for the overall tech industry.
Even as Silicon Valley tries to figure out the business model for generative AI, Nvidia has a big role to fill in the existing tech services people use every day, Huang said. That could help insulate Nvidia even if returns from new AI applications are smaller than expected or take longer to arrive than planned.
“The world has a massive investment in non-AI software, from data processing to science and engineering simulations, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in cloud computing spend each year.” Much of the infrastructure powering that software has transitioned from running on older CPU chips to Nvidia’s GPUs, the chips known for running AI tools, Huang said.
Kress also took the unusual step of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker’s partner’s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to “more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads.” Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year. And Salesforce’s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it’s using AI for coding, she said, ﻿among a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.
Nvidia isn’t the only one arguing that AI bubble concerns may be exaggerated.
“The pure Nvidia numbers/guidance and strategic vision shows the AI Revolution is NOT a Bubble…instead its Year 3 of a 10-year build out of this 4th Industrial Revolution in our view,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in emailed commentary.
Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at investment research company Morningstar, said he doesn’t “see many signs to suggest that 2026 will be a weak year for Nvidia in any way” and sees the bubble fears weighing on the company’s stock as a “buying opportunity.”
But despite those strong results, it appears the stock market may not be ready to relax just yet.
Questions remain about whether tech firms will maintain their massive spending on AI infrastructure, especially asNvidia has invested inkey, unprofitable customers such as OpenAI and Anthropic. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar alsoraised alarmsearlier this month when she suggested that the government should backstop the debt tech companies are incurring to build AI infrastructure. Some took her comments as a sign OpenAI may struggle to afford its commitments, although the company later tried to walk back the statement.
And while Nvidia likely has enough customers even if a bubble burst causes some casualties among AI firms, investors may still be worried about what a downturn or even a slowdown could mean for the larger market.
Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, said questions about the sustainability of Big Tech’s infrastructure spending spree and Nvidia’s circular funding deals were not “put to rest” with its latest report. Instead, they may just be “punted” to the next quarter.
That means Nvidia almost certainly has more work ahead to convince the world that we’re in for an AI boom and not bust."
Big Tech keeps splurging on AI. The pressure is ramping up to show why,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/tech/microsoft-amazon-meta-google-earnings-ai,"Oct 31, 2025, 10:05 AM ET","Silicon Valley’s mega AI spending spree isn’t slowing down anytime soon. But Wall Street’s patience to see a return might be wearing a little thin.
That message rang clear when Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet all said this week that they’re forking over moreon capital expenditures, likeleases and equipment for data centers and infrastructure.
Based on the way analysts grilled executives from companies like Meta, Alphabet and Google on earnings calls this week, they’re eager for signs that these massive investments will pay off in a big way.
Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all grew their overall revenue year-over-year and surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. Microsoft and Google saw their cloud businesses expand by 40% and 34% respectively, while Amazon Web Services sales grew 20% year-over-year – a sign that companies are indeed relying on their services in the age of AI.
And they’re continuing to pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and data centers, an investment they call necessary for the internet’s next era.
The dollar amounts involved are staggering.
Google expects tospend $91 to $93 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, up from the $85 billion it previously forecast. Microsoft sees that spendingup 74%, to $34.9 billion this year, largely lining up with the more than $30 billion it predicted for the quarter. Meta spent $19.37 billion, up from $9.2 billion a year ago and more than the $18.4 billion analysts expected.
And Amazon estimates the 2025 bill will hit $125 billion – andexpects to increase that in 2026.
Even Apple, which is not a major cloud provider, expects to increase its capital expenditure spending related to AI investments, Apple Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said on the company’s Thursday earnings call.
Existing data centers need to be upgraded to handle AI workloads, leading to the giant outlays, said Melissa Otto, head of research for investment research service S&P Global Visible Alpha.
Tech giants justify that spending by saying demand is outstripping supply. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that “as fast as we’re adding capacity right now, we’re monetizing it.”
But Wall Street wants more than just promises of future returns. Meta shares fell as much as 13.5% on Thursday, while Microsoft’s were down more than 3%.
Nearly every question on Meta’s earnings call focused on how the company views its AI investments translating into income, the timeline for new products and models coming out of its Superintelligence Lab and its general approach to AI.
Zuckerberg called AI useful for powering virtual assistants and helping advertisers plan their campaigns. More than a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis, he said, adding that AI can lead to “all kinds of new products around different content formats.”
“We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I’m excited to share more when we have it,” he said about the Superintelligence Lab’s efforts.
On the Microsoft call, analysts wanted to know if clients will make good on promised purchasing commitments and whether the tech industry can really make money from global AI investments. Amy Hood, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said its investments reflect business that’s already been booked, saying that demand is increasing.
Google investors wanted to know how AI summaries and agents are changing how the company makes money from search. Google’s chief business officer said the company makes about the same money from adsbelow and within the AI responses as with traditional search.
The answers satisfied some analysts; UBS said it maintains its “conviction that AI-related stocks should drive further equity performance,” while CFRA Research said it came away from the quarter “more optimistic” about Google’s core business and that Meta “remains committed to becoming the leading AI lab.” Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives said Microsoft is “hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front.”
But that’s as long as they keep growing the products that catapulted them to become the world’s largest tech companies in the first place. Investors are more likely to raise their eyebrows at all this spending if customers start shying away from Meta’s social media apps or Google’s search engine, according to Otto.
“You’re seeing a pressure to accelerate innovation,” said SuRo Capital’s Evan Schlossman. “You have new space in AI that people believe will be extremely valuable, and so there is a rush to sort of fill that void.”"
‘Everyone is hunkering down.’ The affordability crisis is rattling mom-and-pop shops,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/prices-economy-tariff-small-business,"Nov 18, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","Surging import costs. Mounting payroll and healthcare expenses. A shortage of affordable loans. And a stressed-out workforce. Small businesses are facing mounting pressure from America’s affordability crisis.
Doug Scheffel, owner of a family-run ETM Manufacturing in Massachusetts, laid off about a quarter of his employees in April as the Trump administration’s haphazard tariff rollout dented demand for the machine parts and sheet metal his company sells.
“Everyone is hunkering down and building up cash. It’s never been this bad,” Scheffel told CNN in a phone interview. “It’s very uncertain and impossible to plan in this environment.”
Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy, accounting for the vast majority of total businesses in the nation, nearly half of all employees and thebulk of the job growth.
Like other small businesses, ETM Manufacturing can’t take advantage of growth opportunities because financing is so expensive. The average rate on a new urban small business term loan was over 7% at the end of last year, according to theKansas City Fed, but many small businesses face rates well north of 10%.
“It’s infuriating,” Scheffel said.
High prices at the grocery store and elsewhere have left some of ETM’s employees preoccupied with their own finances.
“Most of our employees are distracted. They’re worried about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their kid,” Scheffel said. “Bad stuff happens when they’re not totally focused.”
Scheffel’s employees are hardly alone. About one in four US households areliving paycheck to paycheck, meaning they are spending over 95% of their income on necessities like housing and groceries, according to estimates from Bank of America.
The mood among mom-and-pop shops on Main Street is mixed. While small business owners tell CNN they are hopeful about the future and excited about how artificial intelligence can help them, some are concerned about the headaches incurred by the ever-changing trade war and high costs.
Bryan Pate, CEO of San Diego-based PT Motion Works, an exercise equipment company that sells elliptical bikes, GIBBON SlackBoards and Indo Board balance boards, told CNN that his business is struggling to keep up with rapidly rising healthcare costs.
Over the past two decades, the average cost of single coverage health insurancehas surged by 120%for companies with fewer than 50 employees, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), a nonprofit that advocates for small businesses.
“It’s unbelievable how much healthcare has gone up,” Pate said, noting this is a big disadvantage small businesses have against large corporations. “It’s an unfair barrier to hiring.”
Those healthcare and payroll expenses add to the pressure from the historic tariff hikes under President Donald Trump.
“We just don’t know what the guy is gonna do. It creates so much anxiety and time-wasting,” Pate said of Trump’s evolving tariff policies.
Trump has raised tariffs on US imports to an average rate of 16.8%, the highest since 1935, according toestimatesreleased by The Budget Lab at Yale on Monday.
Pate said his businesses have been hammered by tariffs — including the 20% levy on Taiwan, where its bikes are manufactured.
Ironically, the tariffs are wiping out some US manufacturing jobs.
Pate said his company recently ended contracts with seven assembly workers based in San Diego and now employs workers in Mexico instead. And Pate plans to raise prices on bikes to offset the cost of tariffs but worries that will erode demand.
“It’s been economically painful, and long-term, if tariffs stay where they are, it’s just not going to work,” he said.
Troy Rackley, CEO at The Next Level of Performance, a Sarasota, Florida-based water treatment technology company, told CNN on the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington he has had to raise prices on some of his products due to US tariffs on imports from Australia and China.
Rackley dismissed the argument that exporting countries are paying US tariffs and hopes theSupreme Court rulesagainst the Trump administration’s use ofemergency powers to justifyits global tariffs.
“China, Mexico and Canada don’t pay. I’m the one that’s paying for it,” Rackley said. “I pay taxes on my income, and now I have to pay additional taxes on what I bring in.”
Khari Parker, a graduate of the Goldman Sachs small business program and co-founder of Connie’s Chicken and Waffles in Baltimore, isn’t facing any tariff trouble, but he’s struggling to find affordable capital.
“We’ve being hit with very, very high rates of 20% to 30%,” Parker said.
The Trump administration has worked to support small businesses by providing capital through the Small Business Administration (SBA).
Since Trump took office, the SBAestimatesit has approved more than 58,000 small business loans worth over $32 billion. For fiscal 2025, which closed at the end of September, the SBA said it guaranteed a record-setting $44.8 billion of small business loans.
Small businessoptimism increasedsharply after Trump took office before retreating after Trump’s tariff plans spooked financial markets, according to the NFIB. Optimism later recovered and is currently slightly above its 52-year average.
One recurring struggle for small businesses like Parker’s: attracting talent.
“It’s very hard to find workers. We can’t always offer the same competitive benefits or pay that larger businesses can,” Parker said.
For some companies in construction, those challenges have been amplified by the immigration crackdown.
“A lot of the workforce is nervous from all the stuff going on with immigration,” said Antonio McMillion, president of Maryland-based developer MFP Management & Construction.
McMillion said his company has been forced to hire more expensive workers, raising their labor costs on some projects by up to 40%.
“Hopefully we can pass on the price to the client, but that could also mean you don’t get the job,” he said.
Pate, the CEO of PT Motion Works, is very frustrated by tariffs but remains optimistic about the future because of his employees’ resilience in the face of uncertainty.
“It could be very depressing and demoralizing,” he said, “but no one is throwing in the towel.”"
"A divided Fed is set to lower interest rates again, in one of its toughest calls",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/economy/fed-december-rate-decision,"Dec 10, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is set to lower borrowing costs again, even as stark divisions persist within the central bank’s powerful rate-setting committee.
Wednesday’s decision will likely emerge as the Fed’s toughest call since at least September 2024, when officials debatedthe size of that month’s rate cut.
Fed officials are in disagreement over which side of their dual mandate to prioritize: full employment or stable prices. Job growth this year has been unusually weak and several officials have said the situation could get worse if they don’t continue to lower rates. Other officials, however, say the greater risk is that inflation stays stuck above the Fed’s 2% target as President Donald Trump’s widespread tariffs pack a bigger punch.
This month’s meeting also represents Chair Jerome Powell’s last before his successor is identified. Trump said last weekhe knows who he’s going to nominateto be the next Fed chair and plans to make an announcement “early next year.” Powell’s term at the helm of the world’s largest economy ends in May, and the new chair is not typically nominated until spring. However, at Trump’s request, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has leda broad searchfor Powell’s replacement.
Trump says he’s decided on his pick for Fed chair. Here’s who’s who on the short list
Further casting a shadow over this month’s meeting is the lack of key data on employment and inflation for October and November, which will be released in the coming weeks. The federal government last month began to release economic reports that had been delayed by the shutdown, but the data so far has done little to sway the Fed debate.
“No doubt there are differences in opinions at the Fed,” said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global investment strategist at Edward Jones. “So, their middle ground will be to deliver another cut as the market expects, but provide a fairly cautionary outlook for the path ahead.”
Fed officials will also release their “dot plot,” or updated economic projections, which will likely show just two rate cuts next year.
New York Fed President John Williams, serving in a role that’s historically closely aligned with the Fed chair, said in a November 21 speech that “downside risks to employment have increased… while the upside risks to inflation have lessened somewhat.”
“I still see room for a further adjustment in the near term,” Williams said at a central banking event in Chile. Investors’ bets for a December rate cut spiked to around 70% from 40% after Williams spoke.
Fed governors Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and Stephen Miran have continued to make the case that further rate cuts are warranted, though Miran takes it one step further, arguing the Fed should be cutting rates more aggressively.
“On the labor market, I don’t feel as confident we can get ahead of it,” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that published November 24. “It’s vulnerable enough now that the risk is it’ll have a nonlinear change.”
The September jobs report, released seven weeks after its originally scheduled date,showed that job growth picked upsharply that month; but the unemployment rate, which generally carries greater weight for central bank policymakers, moved higher. There have been several other signs of a weakening labor market, such as Americans taking longer to find a new job and job growth being driven by just a few industries over the past year.
Economic warning sign: Holiday jobs are tougher to find
The path ahead for interest rates is murky.
Over the past two years, Fed officials have lowered the key interest rate by 1.5 points. Those reductions were mostly in response to the labor market weakening. If Fed officials this month deliver a third consecutive rate cut as expected, it would bring their benchmark lending rate to its lowest level since October 2022.
But rate cuts can fuel inflation, which remains above the Fed’s 2% target. Higher price increases may persist in 2026 as tariff inflation reaches a peak, according to Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. In the weeks following the Fed’s October decision, concerns about inflation dominated Fed officials’ public speeches, with several central bankers arguing that lowering rates too soon threatens the progress they’ve made in taming inflation.
Those officials include Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan and Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, both of whom become Fed voters next year. Among the Fed’s 12 regional bank presidents, only four get voting power each year on a rotating basis, in addition to the New York Fed president, who has a permanent vote.
“With two rate cuts now in place, I’d find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly,” Logan said at a November 21 event in Zurich.
So far, Trump’s tariffs have pushed up inflation somewhat, but it’s been nowhere near the worst-case scenario economists had predicted. Fed officials have gradually embraced the idea of tariff inflation possibly being a one-time price level increase.
The Fed is set to announce its rate decision at 2 p.m. ET. and a press conference with Chair Powell follows at 2:30 p.m. ET."
Trump is trying to will lower prices into existence. It won’t work,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/business/lower-prices-inflation-trump,"Nov 10, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump keeps trying to convince Americans that gas costs $2 a gallon. That’s a tall task when it costs $3.
“We’re a little bit above $2 right now for gasoline,” Trump said Friday. “We’re going to be approximately $2 very soon.”
Trump and his administration have made that false claim repeatedly over the course of the year.
The vast majority of Americans aren’t paying anything close to what Trump has been claiming.AAAsays the national average price for a gallon of regular gas is $3.08. Gas is currently cheapest in Mississippi, where the average fill-up will cost $2.60 a gallon.
Making false claims about gas prices and trying to convince Americans that he has made fill-ups dramatically more affordable is a particularlybold choice for Trump: The price of gas is prominently advertised and plastered all over towns and cities across the United States. A gallon of gasoline may be the best-known price – for anything – among American consumers.
Trump is asking Americans to ignore what they see – and pay for. It’s a “Don’t Look Up” strategy that’s proven ineffective: Most Americans remain fed up with the economy and blame Trump for the lack of affordability, according to a newCNN poll conducted by SSRS.
The poll found that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies have worsened US economic conditions.
Democratic party victories in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia elections last week showed that affordability has become an American crisis that could ultimately threaten Republicans and Trump along with them.
So Trump, post-election, has tried to take ownership of the affordability issue.
“The affordability is much better with the Republicans,” Trump said Thursday. “The problem is the Republicans don’t talk about it.”
Focusing on policies thatpromote affordabilitymay move the needle in Republicans’ direction. But, at least so far, making false claims about falling prices has not proven a winning strategy.
If you really want to split hairs, therearea small handful of gas stations across America where you can get fuel at a price that approaches Trump-was-right territory.
The cheapest gas station in the country is the Murphy Express in Ardmore, Oklahoma, which sells regular gas for $2.14 a gallon, according to GasBuddy, which crowdsources gas prices across the country. Early last week, a Costco in Austin, Texas, was selling gas at $1.98 a gallon, but that station has since hiked prices back up to $2.18.
“Generally, we have seen about three to four stations below $2 in recent weeks, but none have held that level for more than a few days,” Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CNN.
That’s three or four stations in theentire United States. GasBuddy tracks 150,000 stations across the country. Those outliers are far from the prices that the vast majority of Americans are paying.
Gas prices have fallen a bit over the past year, and grocery prices are rising more slowly than overall inflation and are a far cry from the 11.4% price hikes they faced when inflation peaked under former President Joe Biden.
But Trump is not even in the ballpark on some his false statements about prices.
“Our energy costs are way down, our groceries are way down, everything is way down,” Trump said Thursday.
“Inflation is at a perfect number,” he added on Friday.
Energy prices arehigher under Trump– up 2.8% in September over the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Residential electricity prices have surgedmore than 6% over the past year– twice the overall pace of inflation. according to theUS Energy Information Administration.
Grocery priceshave risen 1.4% during Trump’s second term. Trump has correctly noted that beef prices are surging because of unique challenges in the market, but grocery bills are up across the board – all six categories tracked by the US government are more expensive now than they were at the end of 2024.
Inflation has been on the rise again, and prices rose 3% in September over the past 12 months – the fastest pace since January. Although that’s far from the crisis-level 9% inflation rate during the summer of 2022, it’s well above the 2% inflation rate that the Federal Reserve targets over the long term.
The reality-denial of millions of Americans’ lived experiences is whatplagued Bidenand helped cost the Democrats the White House in the 2024 election. Trump seemed to understand that during his campaign, making a constant issue of rising prices. But now that he’s in charge of the economy, he’s trying to persuade Americans that the problem has been solved.
The issue is that Americans can’t be convinced that gas costs $2, food prices are falling or inflation doesn’t exist when they can’t make ends meet."
Trump is right: He lowered some of your costs. But he also made many prices higher,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/business/trump-prices-affordability,"Nov 17, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","President Donald Trump keepsdownplaying America’s affordability crisis, and he continues to falsely claim that inflation and overall prices have fallen during his second term.
“Our prices are coming down very substantially on groceries and things,” Trump told reporters in Florida Sunday evening. “They’re already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.”
The truth is annualinflation stood at 3%in September. Grocery prices havegained 1.4%between January and September, and US consumer prices haverisen 1.7%on average during Trump’s second term, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But that’s just an average. Look a little more closely, and Trump really can claim credit forsomefalling prices. But he is also to blame for somerisingprices.
A complex mix of factors determines the price of any particular item.As anyone who took Econ 101 remembers, supply and demand remain the primary influences over consumer prices. But commodity costs, wholesale prices, transportation and fuel concerns, regulations, labor and a whole host of other considerations can weigh on what people ultimately pay at the store.
But Trump’s policies, perhaps more than any president’s in recent memory, have directly influenced the prices on thousands of consumer goods – both lower and higher.
Drugs:Pharmaceuticals remain the the most prominent example of Trump directly influencing prices lower. Trump has put significant pressure on drugmakers to lower prices, and many have followed suit.
Most recently, Trump and his administration announced that certainblockbuster obesity drugswill be available for as little as $149 per month, significantly lower than the list prices, which can top $1,000. Trump has also announced deals withPfizer,AstraZenecaand others to set prices of new medications at“Most Favored Nation”levels, the lowest price made available in peer countries.
Eggs:When Trump took office, egg prices had been surging because a deadly avian flu epidemic devastated the egg-laying hen population. Egg prices peaked above$8 a dozen in late Februaryafter rising steadily over the previous year.
A couple weeks into Trump’s term, hisUSDA announced an initiativeto lower prices by increasing biosecurity on egg-laying farms, providing aid to farmers who lost flocks and temporarily lifting restrictions on egg imports. The plan worked: Egg prices have since fallen to just over $2 a dozen.
Oil:Trump dismantled many oil drilling regulations that he claimed would expand US oil production – but, so far at least, that hasn’t made any meaningful difference. Trump, however, publicly pressured OPEC+ on prices, and though the group of oil-producing nations denied Trump had anything to do with its decision, OPEC+ boosted production several times this year, and US oil fell below $60 a barrel – down from $75 when Trump took office.
Industry experts havepartially attributedOPEC’s decision to Trump’s influence, although they also say OPEC’s hand may have been forced by nations that acted independently of the group. And oil prices have ebbed and flowed with sinking demand and on-and-off Middle East conflicts throughout the year, as well.
Trump has also announced some policies that could have long-term benefits for consumers but whose effects remain to be seen.
Beef and fruit:Last week, Trump signed executive orders thatlowered tariffson imported beef and other produce that mostly grows overseas. That could lower some of those prices, but the tariff cuts largely justrestore import prices to where they werebefore Trump launched his sweeping trade war.
Cars:Trump’s domestic policy and tax billdid away with a number of financial penaltieson automakers that fail to meet fuel efficiency rules. That is saving some US automakers billions of dollars a year and could cut the cost of building a vehicle by 3% to 5%, according to Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities. But that may not translate to lower consumer prices because Trump also raised tariff costs on automakers.
Tariffs:By far the largest price increase on consumers that Trump has imposed came in the form of his sweeping tariffs on virtually every foreign country’s goods. That has raised the effective US tariff rate to 13.6%, up from 1.2% in 2024 – a gigantic tax increase that has raised the average American household’s costs this year by $1,200, according to the conservative-leaningTax Foundation.
The calculation is tricky, because tariffs are paid by US importers who typically pass those costs onto wholesalers, retailers and eventually consumers. JPMorgan this month estimated that consumers are currently paying about 20% of tariffs’ costs, but many businesses have announced they can no longer afford to eat those expenses and will soon be forced to raise consumer prices. That’s why the Tax Foundation estimates the average household’s annual costs will rise by $1,600 because of Trump’s tariffs next year.
Benefits cuts:Historiccuts to America’s safety net programs, including Medicaid and food stamps, will raise out-of-pocket expenses for the country’s neediest: Those earning less than $18,000 a year will have to spend more than 1% more going forward because of Trump’s tax and spending policy bill, according toPenn Wharton
The bill also cut some popular tax credits, including the$7,500that the government chipped in when customers bought electric vehicles.
America’s debt:Trump’s massive tax cut and spending bill will add nearly $4 trillion to America’s $36 trillion in debt, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. That briefly sent the bond market into a tizzy in May, leading US Treasury yields﻿, which trade in opposite direction to prices, significantly higher. Investors had effectively sent a warning that they may be unwilling to keep funding the government’s coffers unless they get paid more for it.
Yields have since come down – but not by a ton. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which influences mortgage, credit card and auto loan rates, remains above 4.1%.
Trump’s spending and economic policies have also hurt the dollar, which has fallen more than 8% this year. That can boost the appeal of US-made goods abroad, but it also makes foreign goods more expensive for Americans.
Meanwhile, Trump has effectively tried to will lower prices into existence,recently callingAmerica’s affordability crisis a “lie” and a “complete con job.” The White House, while casting blame elsewhere, acknowledged it has some work to do.
“The Trump Administration will not rest until the high prices that resulted from Democrat policies are fully reined in,” the White House said in a statement Friday. “We’re making progress — and the best is yet to come.”"
"Fact check: Grocery prices are up, not ‘way down’ as Trump claimed",https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/politics/fact-check-grocery-prices-trump,"Oct 24, 2025, 10:26 AM ET","Newly released inflation figures show that President Donald Trump was wrong when he repeatedly claimed this month thatgrocery pricesare “down” or “way down.”
They were up, again, last month. And they have increased since the start of his presidency.
Average grocery prices rose 0.3% from August to September, according toConsumer Price Index figuresreleased Friday. That increase followed a 0.6% jump from July to August, which was the biggest month-to-month jumpin three years.
Average grocery prices in September wereabout 2.7% higherthan they were a year prior and about 1.4% higher than they were in January, the month Trump returned to office.
The grocery price increases have been broad, spanning the vast majority of product categories tracked by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Prices in four of the six major grocery categories increased from August to September. The cereals and bakery products category was up 0.7%; the nonalcoholic beverages category was also up 0.7%; the meats, poultry, fish and eggs category was up 0.3%; the “other food at home” category was up 0.5%. The fruits and vegetables category was unchanged, while the dairy and related products category was down 0.5%.
Prices in all six categories have increased over the past year. Since September 2024, the nonalcoholic beverages category was up 5.3%; the meats, poultry, fish, and eggs category was up 5.2%; the “other food at home” category was up 1.9%; the cereals and bakery products category was up 1.6%; the fruits and vegetables category was up 1.3%; and the dairy and related products category was up 0.7%.
There have been particularly sharp increases since September 2024 in the prices of coffee (up 18.9%) and beef and veal (up 14.7%). Overall consumer prices are up 3.0% since September 2024.
Trumpcampaignedona promise to reduce grocery prices. Since returning to the White House, he has claimed over and over that he has actually done so – ignoring the federal data that shows he has not.
He continued to make such claims even after the September release of theprevious Consumer Price Index reportthat showed the 0.6% increase in average grocery prices from July to August.
“Grocery prices are way down,” hesaidTuesday.  “Groceries are down,” hesaidOctober 16. “Now, as you know, groceries are down,” hesaidOctober 14. “We’ve gotten prices way down for groceries,” hesaidOctober 10. “Under my leadership…grocery prices are down,” hetoldworld leaders at the United Nations on September 23.
It’s normal for grocery prices to rise over time, as overall prices tend to do, and there is always a complicated mix of domestic and international factors at play. This year’s inflation in grocery prices is markedly lower than the 2022spikesthat followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and it’s important to note that food prices can be volatile for reasons like severe weather, unexpected supply chain snarls and other temporary disruptions.
But food economists like Michigan State University professorDavid Ortegasay two of Trump’s signature policies – tariffs on imported goods (including food) and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants (who make up a large percentage of the US farm workforce) – have clearly contributed to the increases in grocery prices this year.
“This uptick in food prices is consistent with what we would expect the effects of some of the administration’s policies to have on food,” Ortega said.
Ortega noted that there have been recent spikes in the average consumer prices ofcoffeeandbananas, two products that are almost entirely imported in the US, as well as other grocery items sometimes subject to significant tariffs, includingbeef. “You can’t attribute all of” those price hikes to the tariffs, he said, “but I’m pretty confident in saying the tariffs and the current trade policy is contributing to these increases that we’re seeing.”"
"Why the blue wave? It is, of course, the economy, stupid",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/business/democrats-trump-economy-affordability-nightcap,"Nov 6, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.
It’s the circle of political life: Now, as in 1992 when Bill Clinton was trying to unseat George H.W. Bush, what ails the electorate can be boiled down to a soundbite: It is, in fact, the economy, stupid.
Democrats trounced Republicans on Tuesday in three key races with little in common apart from one issue — affordability. It’s the same problem that propelled President Donald Trump to a second term. And the same problem that Trump, who promised lower prices on “Day One,” has let fester as he carries outan economic agendaof tariffs, tax cuts and deportations that are, unavoidably, inflationary.
Elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City reflected an electorate that is financially exhausted after five years of inflation that peaked in 2022. Although prices have stopped rising rapidly, they have not come down, contrary to Trump’srepeated liethat prices “are down” and that there is “no inflation.”
Ideologically and culturally, Tuesday’s mayoral and gubernatorial races couldn’t be more different, but across those closely watched races, voters called economic issues – taxes, cost of living or the economy as a whole – their top concern,CNN exit polling found. Only voters in Virginia saw their state’s economy as excellent or good, while those in California, New York City and New Jersey took a more pessimistic view.
At the same time, Republicans and independents didn’t get any help from the president’s decision tobulldoze the East Wingto build a $300 million ballroom,refurbish the Lincoln bathroomwith marble and gold, or host a“Great Gatsby”-themed partyat his private Florida club last weekend whilerefusing to fully fundvital food-assistance benefits during the shutdown.
“It’s becoming obvious that Trump cannot relate to the voters – and vice versa,” Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments, told CNN on Wednesday. “People can see with their own eyes what is going on with prices.”
Valliere said there is a sense that Trump is “oblivious to the anxiety that so many Americans are feeling.”
Last shutdown, Trump hunkered down at the White House ‘all alone.’ This time, Mar-a-Lago beckons
Those optics gave Democrats, particularly the moderate gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia, room to run on the economy while largely steering clear of Trump-bashing.
Moody’s Analytics found the typical US household is spending $208 more per month now than it was in September 2024 to buy the same goods and services because prices have snowballed. And when measured against early 2021 prices, families must spend $1,043 more per month to buy the same stuff.
“I heard again and again — ‘it’s just too expensive,’ so I focused on those key issues,” New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill told CNN’s John Berman on Wednesday. “I’m going to quickly move to address those key issues, but at the same time, forcefully push back against these economic hits that we’re seeing coming from Washington.”
Energy is also re-emerging as a hot-button issue for voters.
Trump promised last summer toswiftly cut electricity prices in halfif voters returned him to the White House. Instead, electricity prices are rising unusually fast.
While gas is cheaper than a year ago, US residential electricity was 6% more expensive in August year-over-year, according to the mostrecent federal data. That’s twice the pace of overall inflation.
Voters in Virginia are getting hit with even bigger price hikes, with residential electricity prices there surging 13% between August 2024 and August 2025.
A major part of the problem comes from big Trump backers in Big Tech. Long-stable demand for power is suddenly rising fast as Big Tech scrambles to build massive data centers to support the artificial intelligence boom. And Virginia is ground zero for the buildout of those power-hungry data centers.
Takeaways from Tuesday’s elections: Democrats win across the spectrum as voters reject Trump
In New Jersey, which has among the highest power bills in the US, electricity prices have spiked 21% — a fact that pushed many voters toward Sherrill, who vowed to declare a state of emergency on energy prices. According to exit polls, most New Jersey voters who call the economy or health care the top issue in the state backed Sherrill, while voters who are more focused on taxes or immigration supported her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli.
Economic turmoil stemming from Washington, DC — including DOGE layoffs and the longest-ever government shutdown — became a central concern for the hundreds of thousands offederal employees who live in Virginia.
That insecurity compounded voters’ economic anxieties, helping Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger win with her message of “pragmatism over partisanship,” as she referred to it in her victory speech Tuesday night. “You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian.”
In New York, meanwhile, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani clinched his victory with an unrelenting focus on making one of the most notoriously expensive cities in the world more affordable for the working class, particularly when it comes to housing.
In his victory speech, Mamdani reiterated his promise to tackle the cost-of-living crisis by freezing rent for more than 2 million residents, make city buses free and fund universal child care by raising taxes for millionaires and corporations.
Trump denies inflation is hurting Americans. It’s the same mistake that haunted Biden
Exit pollingshowed that message discipline paid off: Mamdani voters overwhelmingly called cost of living the top issue facing the city, with 7 in 10 saying the cost of housing where they live is a major problem, compared to just about a third who say crime is a major problem.
Now comes the hard part, as Mamdani himself stated on Wednesday.
“It’s not enough to diagnose the crisis in working-class Americans’ lives,” hesaidat a news conference. “You have to deliver on addressing that crisis.”"
"As the shutdown drags on, here’s how it can drag down the economy",https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/31/economy/us-government-shutdown-economy-snowball,"Oct 31, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","Thefederal government shutdownhas lasted all month and is on pace to become the longest on record.
While history has shown that the economy typically rebounds from a shutdown within a couple of months, each day it drags on bringsa greater risk that the economywon’t just bend but will start to break — and rupture livelihoods in the process, economists say.
“The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
Congressional Budget Office estimates released Wednesday projected that the shutdown has permanently sapped at least $7 billion in output from the economy.
The negative effects start to build on themselves very rapidly and the collateral damage becomes more widespread, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG.
“That’s kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering momentum and mass,” she said.
Predicting something that has becoming increasingly unpredictable is an impossible task, but here’s a look at how the shutdown could ripple through critical avenues of everyday life.
Prior to the shutdown, the US job marketwas already on its back.
It’s been alow-hire, low-fire, low-churn environment. Employers, frozen by high economic and policy uncertainty, have held off making investments and adding workers. Some businesses have used this period to test the waters onartificial intelligenceand other technologies – in turn putting to the test that “low-fire” descriptor by announcing mass layoffs in recent weeks.
“We’re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,” Zandi said.
Considering that backdrop, the tepid job gains can potentially turn into deeper job losses if safety nets become frayed, more paychecks are missed by federal workers and contractors, and spending pullbacks reverberate through the private sector, causing businesses to lay off workers or shut down, he said.
A US Chamber of Commerce analysis released this week estimated that 65,500 small business contractors have billions of dollars in payments at risk because of the shutdown — $12 billion in payments for the month alone.
Rate cuts and some greater clarity around trade deals and tariffs were supposed to fuel a rebound in hiring heading into 2026, noted Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at employment site ZipRecruiter.
“However, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year’s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,” she wrote in a note earlier this month. “This would delay hiring plans that might otherwise materialize, keeping the labor market stuck in place.”
US consumer confidence during October dipped to its lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump announced a massive suite of steep tariffs on imported goods, according to The Conference Board’s latest index released this week.
The expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage is at thecrux of the Congressional stalemateto fund the federal government and end the shutdown.
Democrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, whileRepublicans say they won’t negotiateuntil the government reopens.
Open enrollment starts on November 1, and the more than 22 million Americans who use the federal health insurance marketplace areexpected to see their monthly premium leapby 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis.
Also on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico are at risk oflosing access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households.
Any center closures could quickly increase financial hardship for lower-earnings families. Child care disruptions have been shown tonegatively impact labor force participation(particularlyfor women), productivity growth and overall economic growth.
The lengthier the shutdown, the higher the probability for a greater drag on overall economic activity, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.
“And this isn’t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you’re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn’t happen,” he said.
There’s the job that doesn’t get filled, the trip that doesn’t get taken and the holiday spending that doesn’t occur.
“At some point, things start to break because they’re just not getting done,” added Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics. “When this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence – consumer, business, investor confidence – the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.”
If the shutdown continues past Thanksgiving, “there’s no coming back from that quickly,” he said, adding that once it passes that “point of no return,” it will cause “damage that’s longer-lasting.”
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. It has remainedlargely resilient, despite massive uncertainty and persistently high inflation.
However, it’s likely done so because of an increasingly bifurcated, or“K-shaped” economy. Wealthy consumers, buoyed in part by strong market gains, are driving more of the spending while lower- and middle-income households are facing increased strain.
A drawn-out shutdown could inject further “crosscurrents” into an alreadychoppy price environment, Zandi said.
On one hand, disruptions to government services and funding could affect trade and supply chains, driving up prices. On the other hand, a weakened economy would mean it’s harder for companies to raise prices, which could help keep overall inflation in check.
“The net of all that, I think, is hard to know,” he said.
Still, the shutdown and its economic fallout could give the Federal Reserve one more reason tocontinue cutting interest rates, he added.
“The Fed’s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions,” he said. “This [shutdown] would weaken the already fragile job market more.”
The shutdown could very well exacerbate those struggles for many Americans, especially people on the margins.
Most Americans are “not taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they’re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment,” Zandi said. “The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think so.”
A lack of funding for safety net programs,particularly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, could not only exacerbate hunger and hardship for tens of millions of Americans, but also threatens to destabilize local economies, especially in rural areas.
“It just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,” KPMG economist Swonk said. “Low- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.”
“It’s hard when you see the struggles we’re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,” she added.

Affordability is in crisis. The solution: You’ll never own anything again,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/economy/affordability-crisis-mortgage-debt-bnpl,"Nov 12, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","Stubborn inflationcontinues to make the cost of living unbearable for many Americans. A number of inventive solutions have emerged — but with a common theme: putting consumers deeper into debt.
This week’s50-year mortgage proposalfrom the Trump administration is the latest example of the trend. Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, remarked over the weekend on X that President Donald Trump’s proposal would be “a complete game changer.”
For many Americans, though, it may not be a good one.
The potential for a 50-year mortgage comes as the auto industry has been pushing seven-year car loans, which have become an increasingly popular option with theaverage price of a new carhitting a new record of more than $50,000. And the explosion of buy now, pay later options online and at brick-and-mortar retailers hasnormalizedtaking on longer-term debt for purchases as small as food delivery.
These offerings can help ease financial anxiety in the immediate future, but they can also do significant damage to a consumer’s financial stability over the long haul.
Case in point: While a 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments, the amount of interest a borrower would pay over 50 years could be double what would be paid at current rates over 30 years, the traditional length of most mortgages.
That’s assuming the borrower even survives the entire 50 years. With average American life expectancy at around 80 years old, most Americans would have to get a mortgage by the time they’re 30 to have a shot – albeit a slim one – at reaping the benefits of homeownership.
“Generally speaking, the more you can avoid longer-than-usual loan terms, the better,” said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. “Cars tend to lose value rapidly when you drive them off the lot, so with a longer-term loan, you run the risk of owing more on the car than it is worth. That’s not a good situation for anyone.”
Buy now, pay later (BNPL), an increasingly popular option for delaying payment, allows many Americans to own more goods by giving them an instant stream of funds to tap into. But, increasingly, consumers — especially younger ones — are making purchases they otherwise may not have been able to afford, as evidenced by the recent uptick in late payments.
A Federal Reserve study published last year on BNPL users reported that “adults who report lower overall financial well-being and those who appear liquidity or credit constrained were not only among the most likely to use BNPL, but most of these consumers also indicated that they used BNPL because it was the only way they could afford to make the purchases.”
All major forms of consumer debt, including mortgages, auto loans and student loans, are at record highs, according to a report last week from the New York Fed, which has been tracking household debt since 2003. In total, Americans are shouldering $18.6 trillion in debt, a 3.6% uptick from a year ago. Within that, credit card debt has risen nearly 6% from a year ago to a record $1.2 trillion, the New York Fed reported last week.
Meanwhile, the rate of consumers who entered serious delinquency — meaning they’re at least 90 days late in making a debt payment — rose to more than 3% in the third quarter of this year. That’s the highest level in over a decade, according to New York Fed data.
The stress is most prominent for student loan payments, of which more than 14% became seriously delinquent last quarter, the highest level recorded dating back to when the regional reserve bank began tracking it in 2004.
It’s having a worrying effect on Americans’ finances:Credit scores fellby the most this year since the Great Recession. As an individual’s credit score declines, it generally becomes more expensive to finance any existing or new debt because lenders view the borrower as a greater risk. To compensate for that, they charge higher interest.
An intrinsic part of the American dream has long been owning a home, and it’s for good reason.
While renting has its advantages, the major upside of ownership is that over time property values tend to appreciate, which generates a stream of wealth that can be tapped into later in life, making it possible for people to retire.
Not to mention, there are also tax advantages to owning a home, such as the ability to deduct mortgage interest payments to lower your overall tax burden. No such equivalent exists for rent payments.
“Homeownership has been one of the most accessible ways for the average person to build wealth,” Schulz said. But with home prices and mortgage rates as high as they’ve been for several years, it’s become yet another financial choice that’s giving people pause."
The dirty secret of America’s holiday shopping season,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/business/holiday-shopping-economy-inflation,"Nov 25, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","Americans, enraged about years of rising prices, are going into the 2025 holiday shopping seasonprepared for battle. But this holiday shopping season could look a lot stronger than you’d expect – on paper, anyway.
How’s thatpossible?
High-income consumers keep spending like they’ve never heard of thisaffordability crisispeople keep talking about. But middle- and lower-income folks, despite declaring that they’refed up with their financial situations, are still spending, in aggregate. That’s prompting forecasts for flat or even slightly higher retail sales growth over 2024 – Mastercardforecastsa 3.6% rise in overall holiday spending this year.
But those folks are spending more in part because prices are higher. Stubborn inflation, combined with already-high prices, has forced people to shell out more for the holidays, pushing spending numbers up.
“Holiday shopping is far from full swing, but spending shifts are already surfacing,” said Vicki Hyman, communications director at Mastercard, in a recent report. “Inflation is expected to be a larger contributor to sales growth, as opposed to actual sales volume.”
That’s why holiday shopping data onBlack Fridayand beyond may give a somewhat rosy picture of the economy, even if headlines fail to expose the ugly side of the economy that has folks so furious.
“Low-income and high-income households are often living in two different worlds – and experiencing two different economies,” Joe Wadford, senior economist at Bank of America Institute, told CNN.
Black Friday through Christmas will test America’s economic strength. Preliminary reports look good: Early-bird holiday shoppers have been out in strong numbers this year, according to a report earlier this month from Bank of America.
Paychecks have grown fatter over the decade, and deposits into Bank of America accounts are higher now than they were in 2019, the bank said. That helped fuel a rise in credit and debit card spending overall, which grew 2.4% per household in October 2025 over October 2024, for the best month since February 2024. Spending has risen for five straight months, the bank said.
Shopping for holiday items was up an even stronger 5.7% over the past year in October.
But here’s the catch: That spending is measured in dollars, not items. The number of shopping transactions that Bank of America tracks has fallen slightly since January.
In other words: Inflation is taking a bite out of Americans’ shopping – and possibly their gift giving this year.
“Consumers are clearly spending more and getting less,” Wadford said.
Some of the spending figures may also be skewed bytariffs.
As Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs took shape, Americans rushed to buy items like electronics and jewelry so they could get ahead of the increase in prices. That may ultimately lead to lower spending on those items during the holiday season – because many people already bought what they wanted or because higher prices may dissuade some folks from making purchases during the holidays.
Another problem with aggregate holiday shopping reports is that they rarely tell youwhois doing the shopping. The details tend to paint a less glossy portrait of the economy than some of the headlines suggest.
For example, the Federal Reserve’s most recent Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes about the economy, showed consumer spending among low- and middle-income consumers is on the decline. They’re increasingly cash-strapped, and they’re looking for more discounts and promotions when they’re shopping.
Meanwhile, the Fed found high-end consumers are continuing to spend  – including on luxury items and travel.
That trend is starting to show up in holiday spending reports, too: Lower-income Americans have continued to spend – their credit and debit spending rose 0.7% last month over October 2024, far below annual inflation – Bank of America reported. But high-income Americans increased spending at more than triple that pace.
It’s part of the so-calledK-shaped economy, in which higher earners get a boost from their stock market investments and home valuations and use their fatter paychecks to spend. But lower earners increasinglylive paycheck to paycheckand look for discounts – or curtail their spending to cope with rising prices.
Those who make $170,000 and above are still spending like crazy – with double-digit growth this year, noted Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. But those with more moderate incomes, particularly those with low credit scores, are spending less than they were pre-pandemic.
Bank of America found that wages are only up 1% year-over-year for low-income families. But prices are up 3% as of the September inflation report.
“When your bills are up $300, but your wages are only up $100, what are you going to do?” Wadford said.
For those who are under financial stress, the pressure is mounting.
“It truly is a bifurcated economy,” American Express CEO Stephen Squeri said on an earnings call with Wall Street analysts last month. Squeri noted that American Express customers tend to spend more money than customers with other credit cards – which he attributed to the fact that Amex customers tend to be wealthier.
That’s similar to executives from other consumer brands, including Target, Walmart, Home Depot, Crocs, Chipotle and Coca-Cola, who all noted some degree of consumer pain among folks who make roughly $100,000 or less – and robust consumer spending among those who make more.
It’s one reason a poll published byFox Newsthis week showed 76% of Americans have a negative view of this economy, up from 67% in July.
“I would call it a K-shaped economy on steroids this holiday season,” said Long. “If you look at the gross spending and gross growth, it looks good. But if you break it down by average spend per cardholder it’s a totally different picture.”"
Trump’s gas price discount has disappeared,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/business/gas-prices-oil-trump-biden,"Nov 25, 2025, 5:01 AM ET","President Donald Trump and his economic team often respond to concerns about the affordability crisis by touting how much cheaper gasoline is than under his predecessor.
For the vast majority of 2025, this was alegitimate bragging pointfor the White House.
Until now.
For the first time since the start of Trump’s second term, the discount between this year’s prices and last year’s has effectively disappeared.
The national average for regular gas stood at $3.055 on Tuesday, almost exactly the same as $3.056 a year ago under former President Joe Biden, according to AAA.
In fact, Tuesday breaks an eight-day streak where the national average was up on a year-over-year basis, according toAAA datashared with CNN.
It’s a big shift from earlier this year, when gas was 30, 40 and even 50 cents cheaper than the same point in 2024.
Although prices at the pump are still relatively low and far from theirhistoric peak in 2022, this trend contradicts a key Trump talking point and undermines one of his strongest arguments on affordability.
During a major economic policy speech in Miami on November 6, Trump claimed, “Gasoline prices have plummeted to the lowest in two decades.”
In reality, gas prices were averaging $3.08 a gallon — nowhere near a multi-decade low and just a few pennies cheaper than under Biden the year before.
During an interview on Fox News that aired last Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued, “Oil and gasoline prices are down substantially under President Trump — and that is really the key to affordability.”
Yet gas prices were three cents higher on a year-over-year basis that day.
Americans say there is a disconnect between Trump’s rhetoric on prices and the reality they are experiencing.
According to aCBS News poll, 60% of Americans say Trump makes things sound better than they really are when it comes to prices and inflation.
Just 27% say Trump makes thing sound about as they really are, while 13% say he makes them sound worse.
It’s one thing to embellish unclear or hard-to-quantify numbers like how many trillions of dollars of foreign investment US officials have secured. It’s another matter altogether to tell people groceries are getting cheaper, or prices are plunging at the gas pump, when neither is true.
Gas prices are a highly visible way that many Americans view the cost of living. The spike to $5 per gallon after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 caused an uproar and a political nightmare for the Biden administration.
Thankfully, drivers in some states are saving a bit on gas prices relative to last year going into the driving-heavy Thanksgiving weekend..
Gas prices are significantly cheaper year-over-year in Colorado (24 cents), Wyoming (19 cents), Hawaii (12 cents), Wisconsin (12 cents), Maryland (9 cents) and North Dakota (9 cents),according to AAA.
However, average gas prices are also up significantly in some states, including Oregon (27 cents), Alaska (26 cents), Washington (20 cents), California (16 cents), Idaho (16 cents), Arizona (14 cents), Michigan (9 cents) and Nevada (9 cents).
None of this is to say gas is expensive under Trump. It’s not.
In fact, GasBuddy projects the average national price for gas on Thanksgiving will be is $3.02 — tied for the lowest Thanksgiving price since the pandemic sent prices crashing in 2020. But the year it’s tied with is 2024, so it’s not exactly something for the Trump administration to boast about.
“We’re basically in the same neighborhood as last year. It’s virtually the same price,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “Policy hasn’t really done anything.”
But when adjusted for inflation, gas prices haven’t been this cheap on Thanksgiving Day since 2016, excluding Covid, according to GasBuddy.
“People don’t feel as bad about filling up their tank because they are making more money,” said De Haan.
Some on Wall Street are betting that even cheaper prices are on the way in 2026.
Oil supply is projected to increase faster than demand next year.
Unless OPEC steps in to intervene, Brent crude oil will likely drop into the low $50s per barrel by the fourth quarter of next year and close 2026 in the $40s, commodity strategists at JPMorgan Chase wrote in a research report published Monday.
JPMorgan said the “outlook worsens” in 2027, with a mounting surplus driving Brent to an average of just $42 a barrel and sinking into the $30s by the end of that year.
The projected supply glut is so severe that JPMorgan said producers will “almost certainly” need to make major adjustments by cutting output.
Tom Kloza, a veteran oil market analyst now at Gulf Oil, agrees that the outlook is favorable for gas prices next year.
“It’s an easy road in 2026. Everything points to a surplus of crude,” Kloza said. “There are a lot of things Trump faces challenges on. This is not one of them. It may not be a lay-up, but it’s probably a free throw.”"

The government is back open. Here’s what that means for economic data,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/14/economy/federal-data-what-to-expect-economic-data,"Nov 14, 2025, 11:48 AM ET","The US government has reopened following its longest-ever shutdown, setting the stage for the eventual release of the gold-standard federal data that is crucial in analyzing the health and trajectory of the nation’s economy.
Data nerds(and government officials,and Federal Reserve policymakers, and business owners, and, well,everyone else for that matter),rejoice!
Starting next week, the backlog of federal data will start flowing, and the long-awaited September jobs report (originally due out October 3) will publish Thursday, November 20, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Friday.
“It’s been like flying in fog without any instrumentation,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
However, expect some choppiness when the air starts to clear.
The very nature of the 43-day shutdown has created an unprecedented situation: Some datapoints were not gathered when they typically should have been, increasing the potential for big holes in what’s expected to be already messy data.
Since the government was dark for the entirety of October and the first dozen days of November, several reports that included data collected in September and scheduled to be released in the ensuing weeks were not delivered (with the exception of the Consumer Price Index), nor was data collected for October (we’ll get to that here shortly).
Other major reports in the wings – likely in various stages of completion – include September data on wholesale inflation, import and export prices, quarterly employment costs, annual consumer expenditures, retail sales, gross domestic product and consumer spending.
That remains to be seen.
The leading statistical agencies are in the process of updating their schedules for economic releases (a calendar set in place more than a year ago).
However, it’s not as simple as plugging reports into different dates. Several releases are reliant on data from other series. For example, CPI and Producer Price Index data points feed in to the Fed’s favored inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index,which in turn feeds in to GDP.
On Friday morning, the Bureau of Economic Analysis – the statistical arm of the Commerce Department that estimates GDP and produces data on topics such as income, spending, foreign trade, and state and local economies – announced it is “working to update its schedule of economic releases” and is consulting with the Census Bureau, BLS and other suppliers of data used to produce the BEA’s indicators.
Early Friday afternoon, the Census Bureau announced revised release dates for three reports originally slated to publish in early October. The August data on construction spending, manufacturers’ shipments and international trade will be released Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week, respectively.
Each economic data series will be affected differently by the shutdown, depending on how, when and from whom the data is collected, said Erica Groshen, a former BLS Commissioner who serves as senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.
Still, she noted, expect the BLS and other agencies to prioritizePrincipal Federal Economic Indicators, which are about three dozen major statistical series used to describe the condition of the US economy. (The jobs report, CPI, PPI, and PCE are among these. The Job Openings and Labor TurnoverSurvey, for example, is not).
As it stands now, October 2025 could very well amount to a “lost” month of data – or close to it.
During the shutdown, the nation’s statistical agencies were run by skeleton crews as the actions of collecting, analyzing and disseminating data were suspended – disrupting finely tuned processes that have underpinned major economic reports for decades.
For example, the jobs report is composed by two surveys: one of businesses and one of households. The establishment survey is primarily automated and relies upon online portals for businesses to submit their information such as workforce levels and pay. The household survey, on the other hand, is largely conducted via telephone and in-person visits.
“It’s very hard to ask people what their situation was five weeks ago, and it’s bound to be unreliable,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. “I think part of the employment report for the month of October will be lost forever, and we will only get the data that is submitted by companies.”
The household survey is what’s used to generate labor force estimates and the unemployment rate,and since that wasn’t conducted in October, “we’re going to get half the employment report,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassettsaid on Thursday. “We’ll get the jobs part, but we won’t get the unemployment rate.”
The lack of a complete monthly employment snapshot isn’t ideal when the US labor market entered the shutdown on seemingly shaky ground; however, a rough picture of the trajectory could still be assembledusing the payroll estimates combined with a smattering of private hiring data as well as state-level unemployment filings and layoff notices, wrote Mike Reid, senior US economist at RBC in a note Thursday.
Thevisibility on inflationdata for October will be “particularly bad,” Reid noted.
Two-thirds of the pricing data that feeds in to the CPI is collected by in-person visits to brick-and-mortar stores, Reid said. Wholesale-level prices also were not collected in October for the Producer Price Index.
That will then ripple through to the PCE price index, where about 90% is constructed from CPI and PPI inputs, he added.
“Unlike the labor market, there are few (if any) reliable alternatives to the CPI report,” he said. “Absent the CPI and PPI reports, it’s hard to gauge inflation’s trajectory.”
And if the October inflation data is released, it could pose a “serious data quality issue,” as it would likely lean more heavily onimputation, a methodology that utilizes a variety of existing datapoints to capture missing information.
“But we know that already when the statistical agencies have all the data available, there’s a big degree of uncertainty, and sometimes the numbers are not statistically significant,” EY-Parthenon’s Daco told CNN. “So, with even less data, the statistical significance of these numbers is likely to drop even further.”
The shutdown lasted through nearly half of November, meaning that this month’s data also will not emerge unscathed, economists said. However, they also fully expect all major reports to be released.
There’s a greater likelihood that inflation data will have a higher level of imputations, noted RBC’s Reid. The timing and staffing levels of returning BLS employees also could impact the collection of data, including the household survey for the jobs report, said former BLS Commissioner Groshen.
“BLS has fewer resources this time, because it is down 20% in its staffing, one-third of its leadership positions are vacant, and it’s possible they had even more people quit during the course of the shutdown,” she said, referencing the Trump administration’s large-scale layoff of federal workers earlier this year via the Department of Government Efficiency.
Still, while it’s possible that the surveying of households in November could include questions for October, it’s unlikely, she said, noting current staffing levels and the heft of the data backlog facing statistical agencies.
“There’s a very highly orchestrated way that those interviews are conducted, so just even running surveys simultaneously is problematic,” she said. “I would not be surprised if the Census Bureau and BLS just decided that they can’t run the October [household survey] again.”
If that’s the case, it’s possible that the BLS could estimate the October unemployment rate from the September and November data, she said.
“Noisy” reports aren’t out of the ordinary for major economic releases such as the jobs report. Large disruptions, including those considered relatively short term, have a way of leaving their mark on data for months (or, in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, for years).
Entering into evidence are the October 2024 and November 2024 jobs reports.
In October 2024, a month impacted by two major deadly hurricanes and massive labor strikes, the initial employment snapshot showed a net gain ofjust 12,000 jobs– a far cry from September’s 223,000-job gain.
It was also a one-time blip.
After striking workers and weather-waylaid employees went back to work in November, the jobs report for that month showeda surge of 227,000 jobs gained.
When the October 2025 jobs report is released, it’s expected to show significant job losses – perhaps to the tune of 1.5 million jobs, RBC’s Reid estimates – largely because of federal workers who were not on payrolls.
And, with the shutdown ending during the week that includes the 12th of the month – the period the BLS uses to tabulate employment – the November jobs report should capture the return of those employees and contractors to payrolls.
Still, the shutdown gummed up the nation’s statistical machinery, and it could take a couple of weeks for everything to get sorted out and running smoothly again.
“It’ll likely be the February period, where we get the January data, before we get our first real clean look at the US macroeconomic data,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. “So, there’s a price to be paid there in terms of the quantity and quality of the data that we’re going to get until early winter 2026.”
The privately produced data provided a sense of what the federal data could show; however, if those expectations are dashed, there is potential for wide swings in the markets, said Zandi, of Moody’s Analytics.
“If they hit the mark, and that’s what they show, then no harm, no foul,” he said. “If, though, the numbers come out and vary from what we expect – either on the upside on the downside – then that may call into question the Fed policy that’s been done since the shutdown.”
US stocks hadtheir worst day in a monthThursday and were lower Friday as traders digested news that the government had reopened. Investors braced for weeks’ worth of data set to be released in short order.
“I say this only half-jokingly: Maybe because the government is opening up again, the market took a dive,” economist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research told CNN’s Matt Egan. “When the government was shut down we could believe whatever we wanted to believe. Now we need to be data dependent and that may not be as much fun.”

Credit card rewards benefit the rich the most. Here’s who actually pays for them,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/19/business/premium-credit-cards-wealthy-us-economy,"Oct 19, 2025, 9:00 AM ET","Americans arefeeling bleakabout the economy. Yet, despite headwinds, high earners are still spending like mad — and credit card companies are offering more and more perks to attract them.
But some experts are worried these additional rewards for the rich are raising costs for everyone else, from merchants to customers.
“Credit card companies (are) working to serve the most affluent customers more and more,” said Doug Kantor, general counsel at the trade group National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS). These companies “try to get (high earners) more rewards at everyone else’s expense by pushing those costs on to everyone.”
This year, bothAmerican ExpressandJPMorgan Chaseadded luxury perks to their top rewards cards. For example, the Amex Platinum Card now offers a $200 credit for an Oura ring, while the Chase Sapphire Reserve comes with a credit of up to $500 for high-end hotels;both cardshave many other benefits like access to airport lounges. These new perks were paired with higher annual fees, with the Platinum Card now $895 and the Sapphire Reserve $795.
However, annual fees are only part of how credit card companies provide what they advertise as thousands of dollars in savings for cardholders.
These rewards are also funded by the fees that credit card companies charge merchants every timeanycustomer pays with a card. These so-called swipe fees often include items like interchange, processing, and other charges that merchants must pay to credit card companies to accept their cards.
The US market has the highest of these rates compared to the rest of the world, “and that’s what’s used to fund these very rich rewards,” said Brian Riley, director of credit advisory services at Javelin Strategy & Research.
So, as the rich lean on credit cards with greater rewards, the price merchants pay to accept them has also gone up — forcing merchants to choose between lower profits or raising their own prices.
That’s why even cash payers end up contributing to these elite card rewards. Joanna Stavins, principal economist and policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, found in herresearchthat those who pay with cash and debit effectively “subsidize” credit card users by paying the same prices without reaping the rewards.
“It’s definitely high-income consumers who are more likely to benefit,” said Stavins.
There’s a growing divergence in spending between high- and low-income households. In September, credit and debit card spending for high-income households grew more than four times faster than low-income spending, according to data from theBank of America Institute.
“There’s a gap, and the gap is widening,” said David Tinsley, the senior economist at the Bank of America Institute.
Almost halfof US consumer spending comes from those with incomes in the top 10% — the highest percentage since at least 1989. And while most low- and middle-income earners prefer paying with cash or debit cards,a majority(51%) of households making more than $150,000 annually prefer credit cards, according to the Federal Reserve’s 2025 findings.
As credit card usage rises, so have acceptance fees for merchants. Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic these swipe fees have increased nearly 70%, according to NACS, which cited data from Nilson.
To combat this, NACS has lobbied for legislation that aims to promote competition and allow merchants to choose credit card payment networks with lower costs. Despite picking up key supporters when the law was introduced in 2023, such as now-Vice President JD Vance, the legislation hasn’t advanced and observers see little chance of it becoming law in the near-term.
Javelin Strategy & Research’s Riley said that without such legislation, credit card issuers have doubled down on premium cards that often charge consumers high annual fees and merchants higher fees to accept them — a lucrative business model in an economy where high earners see the fastest growth in spending and wages.
AmEx did not comment for this story, but theirfees pagesays they provide “simplified options” for merchants to accept their cards. The company also offers lower rates for some merchants depending on their type of business, the amount of the transaction, and whether they’re in an emerging market.
Chase told CNN that while the Sapphire Reserve Card is designed for “affluent customers who deeply value travel, dining and experiences,”the company offers several types of credit cardsfor different types of customers.
Some experts say these swipe fees are necessary for merchants to maintain the advantages of accepting cards.
Todd Zywicki, a law professor at George Mason University, has advocated against proposals to cap swipe fees, arguing that the growing use of credit cards has benefited merchants and consumers alike — giving businesses the flexibility to conduct purchases with no need for cash and providing consumers access to credit.
He noted swipe fees also support services like fraud prevention, which protect customers from paying for charges when their card is stolen.
And, he said, merchants can certainly choose to refuse card payments if the cost of accepting them is too high.
“They want the benefits of accepting credit cards without bearing the cost,” he said.
However, some research shows the divide may not be simply between rich and poor — but rather, that the benefits from these cards go to those with high credit scores at the expense of those with low credit scores.
A study published by theInternational Monetary Fundthat looked only at credit card users found those with high credit scores — including those with low incomes — benefited from the use of rewards cards. High-income consumers with high credit scores gained the most, while high earners with low credit scores ended up losing out more than any other group, according to the researchers.

"Sorry, America. Coffee prices probably aren’t coming down",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/13/business/coffee-prices-not-coming-down,"Nov 13, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.
With renewed verve for the word“affordability”after the GOP got absolutely trounced in last week’s off-year elections, the Trump administration is scrambling to show it’s doing something, anything, to bring prices down.
One solution on offer: reversing its own policy of taxing coffee imports.
“You’re going to see some substantial announcements over the next couple of days in terms of things we don’t grow here in the United States — coffee being one of them, bananas, other fruits, things like that,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News on Wednesday. “So that that will bring the prices down very quickly.”
*record scratch*
This is interesting for a couple of reasons:
To state the obvious: Coffee has becomeannoyingly expensive. Retail prices are up about 20% year-over-year.
There are two primary causes for that price inflation: Extremely volatile weather has eaten into the harvest of an already labor-intensive, hard-to-grow crop. That’s been happening for a few years. And Trump’s tariffs on Brazil (50%), Colombia (10%) and Vietnam (20%)— the three biggest coffee exporters — are piling added costs on top of that. And since coffee only grows in a few places on Earth, it’s not like we can just mow down a few cornfields out in the heartland and start up our own domestic supply.
Coffee prices haven’t surged this much in decades
Through it all, Americans haven’t abandoned their stimulant of choice.
Consumption has held steady through price increases, according to the National Coffee Association, because coffee feels like both an essential and a worthwhile indulgence. There may be no other consumer product that Americans are more devoted to across income levels, political leanings, geography, age, race, gender, you name it.
And businesses know that. Coffee sellers have raised prices to stay in business, and we’re still buying. So why not keep charging us $7 a pop if they can?
Why the blue wave? It is, of course, the economy, stupid
That’s exactly what we should expect, especially when it comes to buying coffee at a cafe, according to Alex Susskind, professor of wine education and management at Cornell.
“It’s a principle that applies to most businesses, that once you take price increases, you tend not to give them back,” he told CNN.
Big chains like Starbucks or Peet’s, he said, are likely to hold strong on prices even if the tariffs go away because their core customers haven’t been deterred by higher prices.
But some price relief could come to the grocery store, among mass-market coffee producers whose customers are more sensitive to price movements.
Bottom line:More than nine months into his second term, Trump is losing the affordability argument — the issue that, by his own telling, won him re-election.A CNN poll last weekfound that 61% of Americans say his policies “worsened economic conditions in this country.” That number topped out at 58% under Biden in CNN polling, and it was generally in the low-to-mid-50s during Biden’s term.
If Trump lowers coffee tariffs thinking he’s going to get Americans relief, he picked the wrong product. We the people may not like paying more for coffee, but we do it anyway. And ultimately, the extra dollars and cents we’re spending on coffee pale in comparison to thebig-ticket issues— namely housing, energy and health care — that helped secure Democrats’ wins last week."
The crypto industry got everything it wanted. It’s still having a meltdown,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/business/crypto-ben-mckenzie-nightcap,"Nov 25, 2025, 4:54 PM ET","A version of this story will appear in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.
This was supposed to be the year cryptocurrency, a 16-year-old asset that promised to be the future of finance, came into its own.
The multi-trillion-dollar industry got just about everything on its wish list over the past year:a rush of new moneyfrom mainstream investors, industry-approvedbipartisan legislationin Congress, a rubber-stampregulatory apparatus, and, not least, thefull-throated supportof the president of the United States.
Despite that, cryptohas had a rough ride, with bitcoin tumbling 30% from its peak in early October, a far steeper decline than the broader stock market.
Why the crypto market is crashing
One of the most prominent industry critics is the actor and author Ben McKenzie, who last week debuted his documentary,“Everyone Is Lying to You for Money,”at the New York documentary film festival DOC NYC. On Friday, I sat down (virtually) with McKenzie, who starred in TV shows such as “The OC” and “Gotham,” to talk about the market meltdown and his film’s well-timed New York premiere.
This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
CNN:Given all of crypto’s institutional support, I’m curious why we’re still seeing all this volatility?
Ben McKenzie:I think there are a few potential reasons. The first is that the economy isslowing down. And if you think of crypto as an investment in essentially nothing, computer code, it serves as sort of a proxy for the most speculative part of the market. It’s like the canary in the coal mine —when crypto crashes severely, it may be a sign that the broader economy is dipping.
The other reason is that the rise in crypto prices was fueled by companies buying bitcoin as a corporate strategy —MicroStrategy(now called Strategy) being by far the most prominent. But things are turning south for the company, its stock (MSTR) is down about 40% for the month, and people are concerned that it might have to sell its bitcoin.
The other problem with crypto is that people take on huge amounts of leverage to further their crypto bets. And when the price goes down and the de-leveraging starts, things collapse just as fast as they went up, if not faster. And that’s what’s scary about right now, to me, is the numbers just get bigger and bigger. But the volatility doesn’t really go away.
CNN:You’ve been outspoken in your view that crypto is fundamentally a scam. What do you say to crypto boosters who say, well, despite the volatility if you’d invested at almost any point in the past 10 years, you’d be sitting on huge gains?
McKenzie:You’re saying that, if you got in early on this thing that I and others have called a Ponzi scheme, then you would have profited. To which I say, correct. Yes, well done. It’s not quite the point that advocates think they’re making.
At the end of the day, it still comes back to the thing I say all the time, which is crypto — because there’s no underlying asset — is a zero-sum game. At best, your win comes from somebody else’s loss.
There’s a moral component to this that gets way outside of what we’re talking about in terms of making money on an investment. The amount of crime that crypto facilitates is truly staggering. You’re talking about money laundering to the tune ofbillions of dollars, influence peddling, terrorist financing.
So is it worth it for some people to win and everyone else to lose? To me, the answer is no.
CNN:Looking at the horizon, what, if anything, is keeping you up at night about the trajectory we’re on with crypto?
McKenzie:I had a bad feeling when Trump embraced crypto last summer, and then a worse feeling when he was elected, and then I’ve honestly been shocked athow muchgriftis going on.
But I am in a slightly better place recently… His poll numbers are starting to tank. The market is starting to tank. The economy is starting to slow down. And you know, if you study other countries and other collapses of unpopular leaders, he may be in for a ride here.
CNN:You’ve been a cryptoCassandrafor a few years now, and I’m wondering if you plan to stay in this lane or if you’re expanding into other areas of speculative market hype? In case it’s not obvious, I’m referring to AI… Is there an “Easy Money” Part 2 in the works?
McKenzie:I’m definitely tempted to swerve over to the AI lane, which is quite a lot wider at this point.
There’s a thing called the grift shift — it’s a time honored con-man tactic to sell someone on something that doesn’t quite work now, but in the future will be amazing. That’s worked for crypto, and that is certainly the pitch for AI. I will say, I’m not a proponent of where AI is heading per se, but in AI’s limited defense, there’s an actual thing that’s happening that actually has a function in the real world that isn’t gambling and crime."
Walmart just proved it’s America’s solution to the affordability crisis,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/business/walmart-economy-consumers,"Nov 20, 2025, 7:13 AM ET","Walmart is proving to be America’s antidote to the cost of living crisis.
A growing number of Americans are heading to Walmart for groceries and clothing as inflation and high prices squeeze their budgets: Walmart’s business in the United States is surging and it’s gaining market share from rivals, the company said Thursday in its quarterly financial report.
Walmart has used its massive size and scale to drive down prices and pour billions of dollars into investments such as raising wages, sprucing up stores and building a logistics network for online shopping.
These investments are paying off for Walmart at a moment when many Americans’ finances are stretched.
Last quarter, Walmart’s US sales increased 4.5%. Walmart saw an uptick in customer trips to stores, and shoppers spent more when they visited. Walmart also raised its sales and profit guidance, signaling it expects a strong holiday shopping season.
Walmart’s gains have been led by middle-class and upper-income households turning to its stores and website to try to save money.
“We’re gaining market share, improving delivery speed, and managing inventory well,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a news release. “We’re well positioned for a strong finish to the year and beyond that.”
McMillon announced Friday that he’sretiringsoon as CEO after 11 years. He’ll be succeeded in February by John Furner, who heads Walmart’s US operations.
Walmart is gaining over Target in particular.Target’ssales have stagnated for around four years.
One major advantage Walmart has over Target is its grocery business.
Shoppers make frequent trips to stores to pick up groceries, and Walmart has made improving its produce section a top priority in recent years. The company has also narrowed the gap with Target on apparel and home goods.
As shoppers tighten their spending, more are choosing Walmart over Target.
Walmart has alsopeeled offlower-income customers from Dollar General and other discount stores."
How Trump built — and is now losing — his golden economic touch,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/trump-affordability-rebate-checks-snap-economy-analysis,"Nov 14, 2025, 12:00 AM ET","It was some feat for Donald Trump, a billionaire with his own airliner who lived in an eponymous skyscraper in liberal New York and wintered in a Florida palace, to brand himself as the conservative champion of working Americans.
But his political alchemy on the economy is dissolving.
Trump’s presidency is taking a wobble as he flaunts his sun king’s life of luxury and obsesses over building, literally, his personal legacy with vanity projects like aWhite House ballroomover his campaign vow to make America affordable again.
Trump is coming across as increasingly oblivious to awave of economic insecuritysweeping the nation, which is hitting many of the voters he won over in two presidential election victories as he transformed the GOP from its starchy country-club roots to ablue-collarelection machine.
It might be agolden ageforWhite House decor, but the new era of prosperity that he promised in 2024 is still elusive.
A slew of recent polling showsdeep pessimismamong Americans about the current state of the economy and its prospects. But Trump doesn’t want to know.  “The economy is my thing. And we have the greatest economy in history,” he told Fox News this week. He seemed irritated to be confronted with questions about high costs for food and housing.
This retreat into a gilded bubble couldn’t come at a worse political moment. Hisapproval ratingsare tanking. TheEpstein scandalis back to haunt him. And the Beltway political and media world has suddenly discovered the new buzz issue of “affordability” after Democrats won gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey with populist economic promises.
As he seeks to stave off lame-duck status, Trump desperately needs to rediscover his common economic touch. If he fails, the midterm elections next year could be grim for Republicans.
Trump’s initial electoral edge on the economy was a shrewd mix of branding, a political sixth sense about resentment boiling in hollowed-out industrial heartlands in 2015 and his own mystique as a consummate dealmaker.
Critics in recent days have lampooned his perceived lack of empathy for citizens who are struggling economically. But he was never a Bill Clinton-style “feel your pain” politician. Trump instead amplified the voice of voters who believed they’d paid the price for the globalization and free trade policies that made the establishment elite rich. He might have been wealthy —but he was never in the club. Like his base, he knew what it felt like to be left out: He’d been spurned by high society for decades, deemed vulgar and nouveau riche.
“We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon,” Trump said in his searing first inaugural address in 2017. “One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.”
Trump’s political magic was also cultural. His dystopian tirades on immigration and crime were popular. His vulgarity helped him pose as an outsider. And the Democratic Party’s turn to aspirational upper middle-class voters and apparent disdain for those immortalized in Hillary Clinton’s disastrous “basket of deplorables” comment helped sever it from the working class. Trump’s birtherism campaign against Barack Obama was a way to exploit backlash to the first Black presidency. And a leftward move by Democrats on social issues drove more voters into his camp.
Trump also had something else — a mythology of success. His spell on NBC’s “The Apprentice” evoked the image of a self-made business titan. If he made himself rich, why not everyone else? Trump rally-goers often cited this as a reason to vote for him, even if Trump’s history of business scrapes and near-bankruptcies told a more questionable story about his effectiveness as a tycoon.
In the 2024 campaign, Trump rode the advantage of fond memories of the pre-pandemic economy in his first term. It was also easy to lambaste the Biden administration’s months of denial on inflation and the failure of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to spell out her own convincing appeal to the middle class.  Trump posed in an apron andworked the fry stationat a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania, boosting his common-man credentials.
It would not be true to say that Trump has done nothing to tackle costs felt by working Americans. His entire economic policy, including tariff hikes on almost every country in the world, is designed to revive the glory days of the 20th-century factory economy. “If you think about your hometown in the state that you grew up, Main Street looks a lot different today than it did many years ago. And President Trump wants to restore America as a manufacturing superpower around the globe,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in March.
The White House claims the massive tax cuts in Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” put more money in the pockets of most Americans, even ifthe wealthiest did best. It says its program of gutting regulations and canceling wasteful spending will do the same. Next year, a new portal known asTrumpRxwill seek to lower drug prices. Last week, the president announced a deal with two pharma giants to lower the price of obesity drugs. The administration claims tariffs raised trillions of dollars. The stock market has been on a tear.
Evidence is mounting that Trump’s policies are making the affordability crisis worse. His tariffs are raising the price of goods for Americans. He’s had to promise a massive bailout to farmers hammered by his trade war policies. His new brainwave is for$2,000 paymentsto Americans pulled from government coffers swelled by tariffs. This sounds like a nice idea. But it could backfire by spiking inflation — and it is hardly a long-term answer for millions of Americans juggling bills and cutting back on the basics, who are now also confronting fears that AI will take their jobs.
The administration implicitly acknowledged its policies are making things harder for working Americans when Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week pledged swift tariff relief on some staples like coffee and fruit. “Coffee, we’re going to lower some tariffs. We’re going to have some coffee come in. We’re going to take care of all this stuff very quickly, very easily. It’s surgical. It’s beautiful to watch,” Trump said on Fox.
But he was partly to blame for the spiking price of a cup of joe, having slappeda 50% tariffon major producer Brazil because it prosecuted his friend former President Jair Bolsonaro for election interference. If ever there was a case of a president’s fixations making life worse for his people, this was it.
When all else fails, there’s always denial. Trump suggested on Fox that polls highlighting anxiety over the economy were fake. Andon “60 Minutes” this monthhe said, “We have no inflation” and, “Our groceries are down.”
The inflation rate is 3.0%, far lower than its peaks during the Biden administration. But in the political argument it’s often forgotten that prices aren’t going down; the rate at which they are increasing has simply slowed. It’s an equation every shopper understands, even if the president doesn’t.
The gap between peoples’ experiences of the economy and his sunny diagnosis of the country’s performance is highlighting how Trump, a politician who performs best when he has an enemy to attack, lacks a vocabulary for empathy. He’s a salesman, a booster, or as his critics would say, a con man who thrives on hyperbole.
Trump is not alone among presidents in struggling to articulate a positive economic message in tough times. In a 1992 campaign debate, President George H.W. Bush was caught looking at his watch while Clinton connected on voters’ economic struggles, creating an instant metaphor of indifference. During the 2012 campaign, Obama’s advisers struggled to find the balance between celebrating the rebound from the Great Recession without appearing oblivious to the unresolved struggles of many voters who weren’t feeling it.
Trump’s behavior in the government shutdown made his case harder — for instance, when he asked the Supreme Court tostop food stamp paymentsto more than 40 million Americans, handing Democrats an easy political weapon. And his indifference to rising health insurance premiums doesn’t help much either.
Trump’s advisers know he has a problem. They are considering whether he should tour the country togive economy-focused speeches. This follows calls from some Republicans, like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for him to drill down on “America First” economic policies after months spent trying to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
“The president gets it. He knows this is an issue,” a senior White House official told CNN’s Alayna Treene. “But he’s frustrated he’s not getting credit for what he’s doing.”
Scheduling Trump for a scripted speech might sound like a good idea. But it could backfire, like the infamous time in the 2024 campaign when he went to North Carolina to engineer an economic pivot and a wild campaign rally broke out. “They wanted to do a speech on the economy so we are doing this as an intellectual speech. You are all intellectuals today,” he told his crowd, mocking his own campaign strategy.
A better option must just be to hold rallies. They might at least restore his political mojo and renew his connection with his voters. Rallies have played an important role for Trump. He used them almost like vast focus groups, testing out lines scanning the crowd to test reactions. He has no such equivalent source of political intelligence in the White House, surrounded by obsequious aides, conservative media and his Cabinet of millionaires and billionaires. Trump does mingle on the patio of his Mar-a-Lago club. But hefty membership fees mean it’s hardly a haunt of working Americans.
Presidents often get too much credit when the economy roars and too little when it sours. But any prolonged downturn in the coming months could doom Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. And Democratic candidates showed the way for their colleagues in Virginia and New Jersey with blue-collar economic themes and by toning down progressive cultural rhetoric."
"Berkshire profit rises, cash soars to record",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/01/business/berkshire-hathaway-profits-buffett,"Nov 1, 2025, 9:08 AM ET","Berkshire Hathaway signaled on Saturday that it remained cautious about markets, letting cash swell to a record $381.7 billion even as profit rose, in its last financial report before Warren Buffett bows out as chief executive.
Between July and September, Buffett’s conglomerate also sold more stocks than it bought for its $283.2 billion equity portfolio, whose holdings, including Apple and American Express, the 12th straight quarter it was a net seller.
Berkshire also repurchased none of its own stock, the fifth straight quarter without buybacks, though its stock price has significantly lagged the broader market.
Buffett, 95, is letting cash build up as he prepares to end his six-decade tenure as chief executive at the end of the year.
Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 63, will succeed the legendary investor, though Buffett will remain chairman.
Abel is known as a more hands-on manager than Buffett. It remains unclear how he might spend Berkshire’s cash, which could include paying the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s first dividend since 1967.
Berkshire is planning to use $9.7 billion ofcash to buyOccidental Petroleum’s OxyChem chemicals business, a transaction announced in early October.
Third-quarter operating profit rose 34% to $13.49 billion, or about $9,376 per Class A share, from $10.09 billion a year earlier.
Operating results benefited from lower loss projections in some of Berkshire’s insurance and reinsurance businesses, though the Geico car insurer reported lower underwriting gains as it spent more to acquire new policies.
Quarterly net income, including gains and losses on stock investments, rose 17% to $30.8 billion, or $21,413 per Class A share, from $26.25 billion a year earlier.
Buffett downplays net results because they include gains and losses on stocks Berkshire is not selling. This adds volatility, and Buffett believes net results are useless in understanding his company.
Investors have voted their apprehension about Berkshire’s outlook and pending management change by selling its stock.
Since Buffett announced on May 3 he wouldstep down, Berkshire’s stock price has fallen 12%, and trailed the Standard & Poor’s 500 by 32 percentage points.
For all of 2025, Berkshire is 11 percentage points behind the index.
Berkshire owns close to 200 businesses that also include utility and renewable operations, chemical and industrial companies, and familiar consumer brands such as Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See’s Candies.
It has not made a huge acquisition since paying $32.1 billion for Precision Castparts in 2016, though it later bought Pilot Travel Centers for $13.6 billion and the Alleghany insurance holding company for $11.5 billion.

Payroll processing company ADP on Wednesday estimated that private-sector businesses added an estimated 42,000 jobs last month, a swing into positive territory after back-to-back months of job losses.
While October marked a return to job growth, ADP’s chief economist cautioned that the pace of hiring is running far slower than earlier this year and far more concentrated in a few sectors.
“That recovery is tepid, and it is not broad-based,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said during a call with reporters on Wednesday.
The largest job gains were spread across industries such as trade, transportation and utilities (+47,000 jobs); education and health services (+26,000); and financial activities (+11,000), ADP reported.
Those posting the biggest job losses were information (17,000 jobs lost), professional and business services (15,000 jobs lost), and leisure and hospitality (6,000 jobs lost).
“The most concerning trend would be that drop in leisure and hospitality, because that points swiftly back to the consumer and how healthy and resilient the consumer will be,” Richardson said. “In the last three months of the year, we’ve seen consumer resiliency push up employment in that sector, so this negative number is something to watch as we go into the holiday season.”
Richardson also flagged that hiring softness among small businesses could be another concerning sign as to the health of the economy, noting smaller companies’ outsized share of employment.
ADP’s monthly tally has shown a significant slowdown in the job market since the summer, with net losses for September and August. Following revisions released Wednesday, there weren’t as many jobs shed in September as ADP initially estimated. September’s losses now sit at 29,000 jobs (versus a 32,000-job loss) and 3,000 positions were shed in August.
Still, a bounce-back was expected for October. Last week, ADP launched a weekly “pulse” report of employment estimates. That report showed that private employers added an average of 14,250 jobs per week during the four weeks that ended October 11.
Wednesday’s job gains came in stronger than the 37,500 jobs added that economists expected, according to FactSet.
The pulse report was launched to “meet the moment,” Richardson said, noting the federal government shutdown’s resulting black hole of employment and other data.
While ADP’s estimates have always functioned as a proxy for the official monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics – which is typically released two days afterwards – the two sets of numbers don’t always track.
However, with no jobs report last month nor expected this month due to the shutdown, ADP’s data has taken on an outsized role for economists and investors looking to gauge the health of the economy.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the lack of government data is “clouding” the central bank’s view of economic activity and that a decision on a rate cut next month is not a “foregone conclusion.”
“If you’re driving in the fog, you slow down,” Powell said at a press conference following the October rate-setting committee meeting. “We’re going to have to do our jobs one way or the other. I hope by the time of the December meeting, we’re getting a better flow of data.”
The Fed implemented a quarter-point rate cut last week in order to shore up a softening labor market, but Fed Governor Lisa Cook this week said she sees more urgency for the central bank tofocus on stubborn inflationrather than on unemployment.
The latest Consumer Price Index report showed annual inflationreached 3% last month,the highest level since January. The most recent jobs report the BLS produced showedunemployment crept up to 4.3%in August and the economy added just 22,000 jobs that month. And, for the first time in several years, there arenot enough jobsfor everyone seeking employment, with roughly 7.2 million open roles but around 7.4 million unemployed people."
Embattled Fed Governor Lisa Cook makes first public remarks since Trump said he fired her,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/fed-governor-lisa-cook-makes-first-public-remarks-since-trump-said-he-fired-her,"Nov 3, 2025, 2:00 PM ET","Interest rates are in a good place to deal with persistently elevated inflation, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said Monday in her first public remarks since President Donald Trumpsaid he had fired her.
Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, is the first central bank official to ever be subject to a firing attempt. In a letter announcing her removal, Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud, which still haven’t been taken to court. Cook sued Trump shortly afterwards, in what has becomea landmark case on presidential power and Fed independencethat will be decided next yearby the Supreme Court.
The court ruled that Cookcan remain in her role for now, and has scheduled oral arguments in January. Cook said Monday she is “beyond grateful” for the support she’s received in her legal battle with the Trump administration, but didn’t comment further on the topic.
Cook has voted to lower interest rates in the past two Fed meetings, but hadn’t commented publicly on the economy since before Trump said in August that he fired her. Fed officials routinely participate in public events to lay out their views on the economy in the spirit of transparency and helping investors understand the direction of monetary policy.
In prepared remarks for an event in Washington, DC, Cook offered a balanced perspective on the US economy, detailing the twin threat to the central bank’s dual mandate of stable prices and full employment.
She pointed to signs of strain in the labor market, such as rising Black unemployment, but suggested there’s more urgency to finish the job on inflation than to lower rates further to prevent mass layoffs.
“Let me be clear. I am committed to reaching our 2% inflation target,” she said. “I see the current policy rate as remaining modestly restrictive, which is appropriate given that inflation remains somewhat above our 2% target.”
Cook’s latest comments come at a time when Fed policymakersare dividedon how Trump’s economic policies might impact prices, employment and economic growth.
There were “strongly differing views” among officials at last week’s rate-setting meeting, when the Fed lowered ratesfor the second time in a row, Chair Jerome Powell said in a post-meeting news conference. Two Fed officials cast dissenting votes, but for opposing reasons: Fed Governor Stephen Miran voted in favor a larger, half-point cut; while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid preferred to hold borrowing costs steady.
That was the first time since 2019 there were dissents calling for both easier and tighter policy.
On one side, Fed officials argue that any inflation spurred by Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy will likely prove to be a one-off price increase and that the US labor market is at serious risk of falling off a cliff if the Fed doesn’t continue to lower rates. Most of the officials in this camp are Trump appointees.
Powell has characterized the notion of limited tariff inflation as “reasonable.” Cook herself said “the effect of tariffs on prices, in theory, should represent a one-time increase.”
The other side of the Fed debate argues that the risk of higher inflation is greater, especially when considering that inflation has remained above the Fed’s 2% target for more than four years. In a Friday statement explaining his dissent, Schmid said he has heard “widespread concern over continued cost increases and inflation” from people in his district.
“Rising healthcare costs and insurance premiums are top of mind,” he said.
The suspension of government data because of the government shutdown, which is nearing the longest on record, has made the Fed’s job of judging the economyeven more difficult.
Cook didn’t provide a full-throated call for rate cuts in her latest remarks, but said she is attentive to the risks around the labor market. She also didn’t sound overly concerned with inflation, stating that her “assessment is that inflation is on track to continue on its trend toward our target of 2% once the tariff effects are behind us.”
“We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated,” Cook said. “Every meeting, including December’s, is a live meeting.”
At the end of Monday’s event, Cook said she believes public service “is worth the scrutiny.”
“I’ve been motivated to do public service, given my family’s history, for example, in the civil rights movement and my participation in it myself,” she said. “And then I had to learn to have a thick skin if I thought the principle was worth pursuing.”
“This too shall pass,” Cook added."
Trump’s drive-thru affordability speech won’t fix his political woes over the economy,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/politics/trump-mcdonalds-economy-tariffs-rebate-checks-inflation-analysis,"Nov 18, 2025, 12:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump proclaimed an economic golden age under the Golden Arches. But while he may have a regular guy’s taste in fast food, he’s looking oblivious to the wrenching price pressure haunting millions of Americans.
“There’s never been a time like this,” he declared Monday at a summit of McDonald’s franchise owners in Washington. The president waxed lyrical about his favorite Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and fondly recalled his turnworking the fry stationat one of the fast-food giant’s Pennsylvania restaurants last year.
But Trump’s overall message was jarring, as he argued the economy was super-sized even while millions struggle to afford the cost of living. “You know, I just might add, this is also the golden age of America, because we are doing better than we’ve ever done as a country. Prices are coming down and all of that stuff,” Trump said.
He went on, “We are looking at affordability — we are going to bring it down for everybody because not everybody understands the fact that a great stock market is great for everybody,” including 401Ks.
Citizens lucky enough to have pension funds linked to record stock markets have done well recently. But they’ve also been punishedby daily costsand the money in their paychecksnot going as far. And that leaves the common touch Trump effectively highlighted as a candidatenow in question. Political peril lurks for him in the gap between a complex reality and his happy talk about the economy — punctuated in his speech Monday by digressions over his renaming of the Gulf of Mexico and his obsession with slow-running taps.
Trump came over all poetic about the unique place of McDonald’s in American communities. “Before the sun rises, you’re up serving hot coffee to construction workers, nurses and police officers on the way to the job,” he said. “In the evening, you stand ready with the fast dinner and the smile for busy moms and their children. There’s a race from school to soccer practice, really, it’s Americana.”
This was high praise coming from a master of branding. But as he often does, Trump explained his political rationale out loud. If he couldn’t truthfully claim to have delivered lower prices, he can try to steal his opponents’ branding on the issue.
“The word is affordable,” Trump said. “And affordable should be our word, not theirs, because the Democrats got up and said ‘affordability, affordability’ and they don’t say that they had the worst inflation in history, the highest energy prices in history, everything was the worst. What they are great at is lying.”
Trump’s speech came across as an attempt to show understanding about daily costs and to repair Republican vulnerabilities exposed by a big night for Democrats ingubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jerseythis month. But it would be hard to conclude his rambling cheerleading fulfilled either goal.
First, and most dauntingly, for Trump, the high prices for mostfood,housingandhealth carethat are antagonizing Americans and souring their confidence in his leadership are almost certainly not coming down.
While inflation, the rate at which prices are rising, is at 3.0% — far lower than the 9.1% peak during the Biden Administration — costs are still going up. No economist wants to see prices go down in a cycle of deflation — that would be a harbinger of a big recession with massive job losses. But at the same time, and after decades of low inflation, voters have yet to adjust to the post-pandemic price shock.
Maybe voters were insulated from economic pressures for decades and have unrealistic expectations. But that doesn’t make it feel any easier.
And after driving Democrats out of the White House partly over their poor record on inflation and affordability — and 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’s lack of answers on those issues — Trump is now suffering the incumbent’s curse. He’s been office for nearly 10 months and voters aren’t feeling better, so he’s getting the blame. Affordability can get a politician elected. But it then becomes their problem.
The statute of limitations for blaming the Biden administration is running out. “(Democrats) are saying that the runaway spending that we gave you guys, that created runaway inflation, is 100% your fault,” Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, said on CNBC Monday. But those are the breaks, even for a president who’d prefer the buck didn’t stop with him.
Trump has made significant policy steps to try to alleviate the burden on working Americans. He’s trying to bring down the cost ofprescription drugs. He temporarily eliminatedtax on most tipsin his big domestic policy legislation. In his speech to McDonald’s franchise owners, he argued that his slashing of regulations that constrain small business growth would end up helping everyone.
But insecurity felt by many Americans who are one layoff away from losing health insurance is structural and long-term; it can’t be fixed with a few quick policy initiatives.
It’s going to need more than Trump’s first big political point in his Monday speech: “You are so damn lucky that I won that election.”
There’s growing evidence his policies may be making things worse. Global trade wars andhigh tariffsare contributing to rising costs, according to multiple independent analyses. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, for instance, reported that the tariffs amounted to an effective tax hike on the average American household of $1,200, a figure set to rise to $1,600 next year.ACNN poll this monthfound 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” And everyone who does their own shopping feels the pain every time they go to the grocery store.
Alleviating the situation will be tricky. Trump’s newest proposals look buzzy and may help at the margins. A potential plan to send out$2000 tariff revenue paymentsis one idea — though such a rush of cash into the economy could spike inflation. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer predicted Monday that such checks wouldn’t fix the damage and added “who knows if they’ll ever come.”
Officials are thinking aloud about50-year mortgages. This might get people into homes — if there’s sufficient supply. But they may never be able to pay them off.
More fundamentally, the White House seems to be implicitly admitting that the tariffs are partly to blame, while insisting publicly that they are not. Trump issued an executive order on Fridaycutting dutieson beef, tomatoes, coffee and bananas. “The prices for those goods weren’t necessarily going up just because of tariffs,” Hassett said on ABC News “This Week” on Sunday, said on ABC News “This Week” on Sunday. But he added, “The prices will go down,” arguing that this was not due to removing tariffs but rather an increased supply of goods.
But Trump isn’t slashing tariffs across the board. To do so would repudiate the central principle of his entire economic policy — which is designed to trigger a revival of American manufacturing. The downside of this strategy was always that if even if it works, it will take years to fully play out, after a period of economic adjustment and pain in the meantime. That’s time Trump doesn’t have, with midterm elections less than a year away.
And the president has left himself politically exposed after attempting such a risky strategy to remake the global trading system that almost every economist predicted would raise prices. It was probably just a coincidence, but he blamed his raspy voice Monday on having to shout at somebody over trade policy with an unidentified country. “I blew my stack at these people,”he told a reporter.
Another complication for Trump is that his impressive power at defining the political narrative may be starting to fail him. He was just forced into acomplete reversalby calling on the House of Representatives to vote to compel his own Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files to avoid an embarrassing political defeat.
Even one of his top supporters,Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, is rebuking him for losing sight of the concerns of the MAGA base, including on costs. Convincing millions of voters that an election was stolen is one thing. Telling them the economy is in a “golden age” when they know well that it is not won’t work. Trump seems to be coming dangerously close to the inflation denial of the Biden administration, which helped cost Democrats the 2024 election.
Trump has hardly been helping himself. Obsessing over personal legacy projects like the newWhite House ballroom, dining with corporate CEOs and flying around the world in search of a Nobel Peace Prize isn’t exactly the look of a president laser-focused on the uncertainty facing millions of Americans.
And his speech at the McDonald’s event did not offer any real sense of empathy for people who were hurting. He threw in the new Washington buzzword “affordability” a few times. He offered a litany of statistics that were often misleading about prices coming down. Such claims are often incomplete or untrue, asCNN’s Daniel Dale has documented.
But Trump did show flashes of what makes him a compelling political personality. He quipped that some people might not want to hand down wealth to children they didn’t like. If only that were a concern for most Americans. And he revealed striking new operational details about the daring US stealth bomber raid that targeted Iran’s nuclear sites earlier this year.
But his levity felt off-key given the subject, and politically unwise amid claims he’s out of touch. Trump aides are thinking aboutsending him around the countryto give a series of economic speeches. But the president himself identified a potential flaw with that strategy, celebrating his refusal to stick to a script during his appearance on Monday.
Trump said he’d given a McDonald’s executive a signed page of his printed speech offstage. “‘I said, do you want to keep this? You can either hang it, you can give it to somebody, you can throw it away. I don’t care.’ But I don’t stay on the speech too long anyway, you know, so usually those speeches aren’t too accurate.”
And one more thing. The next time the Beast presidential limo shows up at a drive-thru, the commander-in-chief has a special request. “I like the fish. I like it,” Trump said. “You could do a little bit more tartar sauce someplace, seriously.”"
Major milestone: US gas prices drop below $3 a gallon for first time since May 2021,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/business/gas-prices-three-dollars,"Dec 2, 2025, 5:47 AM ET","The last time gasoline was this cheap,4% inflationseemed alarming, JD Vance wasstill a private citizenand the United States had only just begun its messywithdrawal from Afghanistan.
Gas prices dropped below an average of $3 a gallon in the United States on Tuesday for the first time in four-and-a-half years, according to AAA.
The milestone represents a rare feel-good story in a years-long affordability crisis marked by high prices for necessities.
The national average forregular gas dipped to $2.998 a gallon, compared with $3.001 on Monday. Pump prices are down about six cents in just the past week and are below $3 for the first time since May 2021.
Gas is also cheaper than it was last year, albeit modestly. The national average a year ago was $3.05 a gallon. Last month, gas prices werebriefly more expensiveon a year-over-year basis.
Prices are even lower in many parts of the country.
According to AAA, the average price for gas is below $2.75 a gallon in 18 states, including New Mexico, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Iowa and Colorado.
It’s a far cry from 2022 when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices skyrocketing. At one point, gas prices surged beyond $5 a gallon for the first time ever, prompting the Biden administration to release emergency oil stockpiles.
President Donald Trump has made lower energy prices a central focus of his second term, vowing to keep a lid on prices at the pump by embracing a “drill, baby, drill” agenda of deregulation and support for fossil fuels.
Days into his second term, Trump also used a high-profile speech at Davos to call for Saudi Arabia-led OPEC to ramp up production.
Although Trump’s promises to slash grocery prices have not borne out and electric bills have increased sharply, gas is a bit cheaper than it was at this point last year. The biggest reason: Oil is much cheaper than it was at this point in prior years.
In early December 2022, months after Russia invaded Ukraine, US oil prices were sitting at about $81 a barrel. At this point last year, crude traded at around $70 a barrel. Today a barrel of crude is selling for just $59.
Oil has been driven lower by the fact that supply continues to outpace demand.
US oil production continues to break record highs, although it is only slightly higher than a year ago.
The bigger driver is the fact that OPEC has ramped up production this year, something the producer group refused to do in years past.
As always, oil prices can quickly change course, especially if investors fear a geopolitical conflict will threaten supplies. Trump in recent days has threatened to attack Venezuela, which hasmore oil reservesthan any nation on the planet.
But some on Wall Street are betting oil prices could stay cheap for some time, keeping gas prices low.
If OPEC doesn’t intervene to ease the supply glut, Brent crude oil – the international benchmark – will likely drop into the low $50s per barrel by the fourth quarter of next year and close 2026 in the $40s, JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote in a recent report.
JPMorgan said the “outlook worsens” in 2027, with a mounting surplus driving Brent to an average of just $42 a barrel and sinking into the $30s by the end of that year.

"The metaverse is cooked, and Wall Street couldn’t be happier",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/business/meta-metaverse-stock-nightcap,"Dec 4, 2025, 5:02 PM ET","A version of this story will appear in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.
It appears Meta may finally be ready to put the metaverse out of its misery.
Shares of the company formerly known as Facebook shot up 7% early Thursday in response to aBloomberg reportthat CEO Mark Zuckerberg is slashing the metaverse team’s budget by as much as 30%. CNN hasn’t confirmed the report. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson confirmed that “we are shifting some of our investment” from the metaverse group toward AI glasses and wearables.
The stock ended the day up 3.4%.
It’s not hard to see why Wall Street is so thrilled. After four years and billions of dollars wasted, the metaverse — a feature that Zuck believed in so deeply that herenamedthe company after it — is more or less cooked.
The thing never made much sense, even when Zuck dramatically declared the metaverse would be “the successor of the mobile internet.” The company initially set a goal of 500,000 monthly active users inHorizons Worlds, a virtual reality space, by the end of 2022. According tothe Wall Street Journal, Meta revised that goal by nearly half later that year.
To be clear, we don’t know yet what will become of the metaverse, which is part of Meta’s Reality Labs divisionoverseeing its virtual reality headsets. And Zuckerberg has said he still believes people will one day spend significant amounts of time in virtual worlds.
But the entire project is, to say the least, a far cry from the vast digital idyll of Zuck’s pandemic-era fever dream, and it’s getting shoved to the back of the closet like so many well-intentioned Covid projects.
Investors (and most people using the internet) were skeptical from the start.
The metaverse was asquishy concept, pitched to a populace that had just emerged from Covid lockdowns and wanted little more than to be around other humansoffline,in real life. Meta was telling us that the future of social media would be immersive, like a giant Zoom call populated by digital alter egos that can interact and play games and buy stuff from one another for … fun? It wasn’t actually clear what the point was, and regardless, getting there required access to a bulky $400 headset.
Of course, the timing of Meta’s rebrand was also important. Facebook was desperately trying to army crawl out of a swamp of negative headlines linked to whistleblowerFrances Haugen, who leaked internal documents to the Wall Street Journal detailing how the social media giant repeatedly failed to address problems on its platforms that executives knew were harming users (especially teens).
The company, under all kinds of scrutiny and still sore it missed out on the move to smartphones, needed a narrative shift.
Meta’s big problem: Everything about VR looks supremely uncool
But the more we the people got glimpses into the metaverse, the less appealing it became. About a year after the Meta pivot, an image of Zuck’s own blocky, dead-eyed visage from inside the metaverse went viral because of how shockingly mid the graphics still were after a year of work and billions of dollars to build it. At the time, I wrote up what I saw as Meta’s biggest metaverse problem:It just doesn’t look cool.
The early appeal of Facebook lay partly in how it allowed people to make themselves look cool, whatever that meant to them.
You could be funny or hot or mysterious in your profile picture. You could write up a clever status message name-checking some under-the-radar indie band. You created a whole vibe with your lists of favorite movies and music and books. And you could connect with people in a way that left the meaning of your connection ambiguous — “friending” could mean so much, or so little, no pressure, whatever, just be cool.
That cool factor is decidedly lacking in the metaverse. But Zuck may have learned at least one lesson from the debacle: Aesthetics matter, which is whyMeta is poaching Apple’s top designer, Alan Dye, to run a new studio for hardware, software and AI integration.
Savings from metaverse cuts, people familiar with the plans told Bloomberg, are expected to be diverted to other projects, including AI glasses and other wearables, where Meta is trying to cement its dominance. This year, the company held a huge lead over rivals, capturing 61% of the market for smart glasses and AR/VR headsets,according to IDC Global.
Like the metaverse, though, AI’s financial return is far from certain, and Wall Street has expressed concern about Zuck’s willingness to spend astronomically on unproven tech, even one as popular as AI.
Zuck is, characteristically, undeterred. “If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously,” he said in September on the“Access” podcast. “But what I’d say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.”"
The hottest new AI company is…Google?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/29/tech/ai-chips-google-gemini-3-tpu-nvidia,"Nov 29, 2025, 7:01 AM ET","Google just threw another twist in the fast-changing AI race. And its biggest competitors are taking notice.
“We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google,” Nvidiawrotein a November 25 post on X, before adding that “NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs,” (the application-specific integrated circuits) like those made by Google.
“Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman alsowrote on X.
The posts came just days after mounting buzz about Google’s Gemini 3 model — andthe Google-made chipsthat help to power it. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioffwrote on Xthat he’s not going back to ChatGPT after trying Google’s new model. “The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again,” he wrote.
Now Meta is said to be in talks with Google about buying its Tensor chips, according toThe Information, coming afterAnthropic saidin October that it plans to significantly expand its own use of Google’s technology.
Shares of Google were up nearly 8% last week, while Nvidia’s were down a little over 2%.
At stake is more than just bragging rights or a few sales contracts. As the tech industry claims AI will reshape the world — including investment portfolios belonging to everyone from billionaires to 401k-holding retirees — what company and what vision comes out on top could affect nearly every American.
At face value, Nvidia’s post says the company isn’t worried about Google encroaching on its territory. And for good reason — Google’s chips are fundamentally different from Nvidia’s offerings, meaning they aren’t a match-for-match alternative.
But that OpenAI and Nvidia felt the need to acknowledge Google at all is telling.
“They’re in the lead for now, let’s call it, until somebody else comes up with the next model,” Angelo Zino, senior vice president and technology lead at CFRA, told CNN.
Google and Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nvidia declined to comment.
Google is hardly an AI underdog. Along with ChatGPT, Gemini is one of the world’s most popular AI chatbots, and Google is one of the few cloud providers large enough to be known as a “hyperscaler,” a term for the handful of tech giants that rent out cloud-based computing resources to other companies on a large scale. Google services like Search and Translate have used AI as far back as the early 2000s.
Even so, Google was largely caught flat-footed by OpenAI’s ChatGPT when it arrived in 2022. Google management reportedly issued a “code red” in December 2022 following ChatGPT’s seemingly overnight success, according toThe New York Times. ChatGPT now has at least 800 million weekly active users, according to its maker, OpenAI, while Google’s Gemini app has 650 million monthly active users.
But Gemini 3, which debuted on November 18, now sits at the top ofbenchmark leaderboardsfor tasks like text generation, image editing, image processing and turning text into images, putting it ahead of rivals like ChatGPT, xAI’s Grok and Anthropic’s Claude in those categories.
Google said over one million users tried Gemini 3 in its first 24 hours through both the company’s AI coding program and the tools that allow digital services to connect to other apps.
But people tend to use different AI models for different purposes, says Ben Barringer, the global head of technology research at investment firm Quilter Cheviot. For example, models from xAI and Perplexity are ranked higher than Gemini 3 search performance in benchmark tests.
“It doesn’t necessarily mean (Google parent) Alphabet is going to be … the end-all when it comes to AI,” said Zino. “They’re just kind of another piece to this AI ecosystem that continues to get bigger.”
Google began making its Tensor chips long before the recent AI boom. But Nvidia still dominates in AI chips with the company reporting 62% year-over-year sales growthin the October quarterand profits up 65% compared to a year ago.
That’s largely because Nvidia’s chips are powerful and can be used more broadly. Nvidia and its chief rival, AMD, specialize in chips known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, which can perform vast amounts of complex calculations quickly.
Google’s Tensor chips are ASICs, or chips that are custom-made for specific purposes.
While GPUs and Google’s chips can both be used for training and running AI models, ASICs are usually designed for “narrower workloads” than GPUs are designed for, Jacob Feldgoise, senior data research analyst at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, told CNN in an email.
Beyond the differences in the types of chips themselves, Nvidia provides full technology packages to be used in data centers that include not just GPUs, but other critical components like networking chips.
It also offers a software platform that allows developers to tailor their code so that their apps can make better use of Nvidia’s chips, a key selling point for hooking in long-term customers. Even Google is an Nvidia client.
“If you look at the magnitude of Nvidia’s offerings, nobody really can touch them,” said Ted Mortonson, technology desk sector strategist at Baird.
Chips like Google’s won’t replace Nvidia anytime soon. But increased adoption of ASICs, combined with more competition from AMD, could suggest companies are looking to reduce their reliance on Nvidia.
And Google won’t be the only AI chip competitor, said Barringer of Quilter Cheviot, and it’s doubtful it will achieve Nvidia’s dominance.
“I think it’s a part of a balance,” he said."
Why car prices won’t stop rising,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/business/average-car-prices-fifty-thousand,"Dec 3, 2025, 6:30 AM ET","Prepare for automotive sticker shock next year – again.
Average new car prices brieflytopped $50,000in September for the first time, before slipping back under that level in October.
But now, automotive experts say, car prices are headed back over that level. And this time, they might stay there.
Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, and Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, say cars are nearing that mark.
“It’ll edge up, even as much as the consumer doesn’t want to pay that amount,” said Drury. “It’s just the cost of everything on a car is going up, and $50,000 is just not that far away.”
The higher prices for cars – a necessity in many transit-starved cities and towns – are part of a larger affordability crisis that’s squeezed Americans, leaving many living paycheck to paycheck just to get by.
President Donald Trump, alongside top auto executives, announceda “reset” of federal fuel-economy standards for vehicles during a White House event on Wednesday.
Trump said his action, which rolls back emissions standards set by the Biden administration, will lead to lower car prices by reducing the costs automakersaccrue to meet tougher emission rules.
“Today my administration is taking historic action to lower costs for American consumers, protect American auto jobs and make buying a car much more affordable,” Trump said.﻿ “These policies force automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices.”
Trump also claimed that this move should save consumers $1,000 off the price of a car.
The CEOs of Ford and Stellantis, the European automaker that produces the Jeep, Ram and Dodge brands in the US, issued statements in advance of the event that praised the administration’s actions. Butthe change will do little to lower the cost of building cars.
All automakers plan their models and features years in advance, and many buyers look for improved fuel economy when shopping for cars.
Automakers also have to meet tougher mileage rules in other countries, and even some individual US states. Despite facing legal challenges from the Trump administration, many states follow strict emission rules set California.
Lastly, Wednesday’s action likely will not provide additional savings since mileage rules were essentially gutted earlier this year when legislation ended financial penalties for automakers for exceeding emission standards.
General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was not at the White House event, said earlier Wednesday that GM would continue improving fuel efficiency even if the mileage rules are rolled back. Speaking from the New York Times’ Dealbook conference in New York, Barra added that GMwould also continue to invest in electric vehicles.
No matter what changes are made to fuel-efficient rules, here’s why Americans will likely shell out more for a new car next year.
Car buyers often shop based on their anticipated monthly payment, with 80% of car sales financed, according to Experian.
Nearly a fifth of new cars now have monthly payments of $1,000 or more, Experian said, a result of a 30% increase in car prices and sharply higher interest rates since October 2019.
If the Federal Reserve keeps cutting interest rates, buys could face less in interest costs. But, perversely, that could give dealers room to increase their prices, keeping total monthly payments the same or even higher. (Anyone who’s ever bought a car likely knows the negotiating process at the dealership that ultimately determines how much a car costs.)
“Most consumers do shop by a monthly payment,” said Keating. “So I think that the monthly payment is far more impactful than anyone is giving it credit for. While affordability will still be an issue, they may feel a lot better about that monthly payment as rates go down.”
Wealthier households have also prospered in the K-shaped economy, in which higher- and lower-income households see diverging fortunes.
Stock market gains, fatter paychecks, rising home prices and anticipated tax refunds from Trump’s massive domestic policy bill could all fuel demand from richer buyers, driving sales of costlier models and pushing up average prices overall.
“This is why we believe the spring selling season is likely to be better than it’s been in typical years,” said Keating.
The end of the electric vehicle buyer tax credit in Trump’s tax and spending bill in July got a lot of attention. But the bill also quietly removed financial penalties for automakers that exceed emission regulations.
That means automakers now have greater freedom to concentrate on sales of larger, more profitable pickup trucks and SUVs – which also happen to be more expensive, again lifting average car prices in general.
Automakers have so far been reluctant to raise car prices too much and risk angering Trump, as well as potentially losing buyers to rivals.
But the average sticker price, after rising less than 3% compared to a year earlier in all but one month through August, rose about 4% in September and October, according to Edmunds. That’s because the model-year 2026 vehicles are hitting the lots, typically with higher sticker prices. Those newer models will make up an increasing share of sales going into next year as the remaining 2025 model-year vehicles are cleared out.
But there’s at least one scenario in which prices could fall – although it might be worse than higher price tags.
If the job market softens further and people increasingly lose their jobs, the bottom can fall out of the demand. Sales plunged thanks to the job losses of the Great Recession, with General Motors and Chrysler ending up with bankruptcies and federal bailouts.
No one is predicting anything that catastrophic this time. But job losses and a recession would be one very painful way to keep prices in check.
“I don’t think the headwinds predict that much of a fall,” said Keating. “I don’t think it’s waving warning flags just yet that say, ‘Hey, we’re in for a big dip.’”

"A first look at November hiring shows the private sector lost 32,000 jobs",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/economy/us-adp-private-jobs-report-november,"Dec 3, 2025, 8:20 AM ET","Small businesses are starting to crack amid a weakening economy, rising costs and fickle consumers; and they drove job losses in the US private sector in November, payroll giant ADP reported Wednesday.
ADP’s latest monthly look at private-sector employment showed that about 32,000 jobs were lost last month, marking a drop-off from the upwardly revised 47,000 jobs gained in October.
ADP’s reports have gained in prominence in recent weeks as the longest shutdown in US historystifled statistical agencies’ abilities to collect, analyze and release economic data.
The November jobs report, originally slated for release on Friday, isdelayed until December 16. It also will include partial data from October, a month where a full jobs report was nixed.
As such, Wednesday ADP data is likely the next-best estimate on the labor market Federal Reserve officials will get before their policymaking meeting next week.
Still, while ADP’s tabulations don’t often correlate with theofficial jobs numbers, they’re looked to as an indicator of hiring and wage growth activity.
And in recent months, that trajectory hasn’t been great.
Consumer confidence falls to lowest in seven months as concerns grow about the economy
Private employers have shed jobs in four of the past six months, ADP data shows. The net loss of 32,000 reported for November is the largest monthly drop in two and a half years.
“The (ADP) report shows the job market is losing more momentum at year-end and skews risks toward modestly higher unemployment early next year,” Oren Klachkin, Nationwide’s financial markets economist, wrote in a note Wednesday. “There’s a high level of disagreement among Fed policymakers right now, but we maintain our call the doves will prevail over the hawks and the FOMC to vote for another [quarter-point] interest rate reduction at next week’s meeting.”
The estimated job losses reported for November were overwhelmingly at small establishments (classified as having between one and 49 employees), which shed an estimated 120,000 jobs last month. Medium and large businesses added 51,000 jobs and 39,000 jobs, respectively.
“When you look historically, the labor market is not weak, but it is weakening — and the first to crack are small establishments,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said Wednesday in a call with reporters. “I see them as a canary in the coal mine. Things could shift, but small firms are the leading indicator.”
It’s possible that the steep losses at small businesses could be tied to spillover effects from theUS government shutdown, which lasted from October 1 to November 12, she said.
However, the estimated labor force cutbacks are likely more a reflection of small businesses trying to weather an uncertain economic environment and an increasingly cautious consumer, she said.
“You can see that there are a lot of different angles of concern for the smallest firms: It’s about supply, it’s about high price levels,” she said Wednesday. “Even if you think that inflation is declining or moderate or any tariff impact is transitory, if you look at cumulative price increases over the last five years, it’s up around 25%.”
And when small businesses don’t have the wiggle room to navigate higher prices – notably the ability toabsorb cost increasesfromfrequently shifting tariffs– they often shift their hiring patterns to help offset rising costs, she added.
Businesses are likely staying lean – delaying hiring, not replacing workers – versus making outright layoffs, so that they can weather an uncertain economic environment, she said.
“And all of that is adding up to job losses on a national level,” she said.
That low-hire, low-fire activity has been heavily supported by other economic data, specifically claims for unemployment benefits. First-time claims have remained fairly stable while continuing claims (those filed by people who have received a week or more in jobless benefits) have been butting up against four-year highs.
By industry, the losses were more broad-based, with some of the deeper drops in industries such as professional and business services, information and manufacturing.
Economists were expecting that 40,000 jobs would be added, according to FactSet.

Why the Goldman Sachs CEO isn’t buying the AI jobs freakout,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/business/david-solomon-goldman-sachs-ai,"Nov 3, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","The fingerprints of artificial intelligence are all over mass layoffs and downsizing at Meta, Amazon, Salesforce, YouTube and other major companies, raising fears of anAI-fueled jobs wipeoutforwhite-collar workers.
AI may hurt demand for office workers, but there’s reason for hope, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon believes. The dynamic American workforce will evolve, as it has in the past, Solomon told CNN during a sit-down interview.
Solomon, speaking from the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington, cited the disruption caused by the invention in the late 1700s of the steam engine, which helped fuel the first industrial revolution.
“There will be disruption. But I’m a big believer that our economy is very nimble, very flexible. And when you look at the technology that has flooded over hundreds of years into our society, we adapt,” Solomon said. “We find new businesses. We find new jobs. I don’t believe it will be different this time.”
Of course, that adjustment process can be difficult – especially for the workers whose careers have been sidelined by new technology.
A key difference this time is the explosive speed at which AI is being embraced by businesses – and how rapidly AI itself is advancing. A Goldman Sachs survey of bankers found that 37% of clients are using AI for regular production, with adoption expected to hit 50% next year and 74% in the next three years.
ChatGPT launched in November 2022 and nowboasts 800 million weekly active users. Its parent company OpenAI is reportedly laying the groundwork for an IPO that couldvalue it at up to $1 trillion.
Today’s AI chatbots can do deep research, generate stunningly realisticfilms, compose music andinstantly flag financial fraudbefore it can even get completed.
That speed could make the transition bumpier this time around.
“The pace of adoption of this technology is going a little bit faster. As businesses wrestle with deploying the technology and the automation, the short-term disruption might be a little bit higher,” the Goldman Sachs CEO said. “But our economy is incredibly broad and nimble.”
Office workers may be especially exposed to that disruption.
Although Amazon CEO Andy Jassytold analysts the company’s recent 14,000 layoffswere “not even really AI driven,” he said in June thatadopting generative AI and AI agentswill shrink the company’s corporate workforce.
Meta recently cut 600 roles within its AI team, whichreportshave indicatedis part of an effort to move more nimbly. YouTube this week began offering voluntary buyouts to US employees as part of an AI-focused restructuring.
Workers at Chegg, an online education company, are being hurt by AI on two fronts. First, the rise of ChatGPT is lowering demand for Chegg’s education services. Secondly, Chegg itself is investing in AI, promising to run its business leaner with fewer workers to compete. This week Chegg said it willslash nearly half its workforceas it grapples with the “new realities of AI” and lower search traffic.
AI was cited as a reason for 17,375 layoff announcements this year tracked by outplacement and coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas through the end of September. That represents less than 2% of the total layoffs announced this year.
However, Challenger noted that this tally likely undershoots AI-linked layoffs. Another 20,219 job cuts announced during that period were tied to companies citing unspecified technological updates – some of which could be related to AI.
“The need for some white-collar office jobs will be diminished, but they’ll be picked up in other parts of the economy,” said Solomon.
By contrast, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned that AI could eliminate half of entry-level jobs in white-collar professions, lifting the unemployment rate to up to 20% in the near future.
“It’s eerie the extent to which the broader public and politicians, legislators, I don’t think, are fully aware of what’s going on,”Amodei told CNN’s Anderson Cooperin May. “We have to act now. We can’t just sleepwalk into it.”
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged during a press conference that a “significant number of companies” are either doing layoffs or saying they won’t hire much in part because of AI.
“We’re watching that very carefully…It could absolutely have implications for job creation,” Powell said.
A survey of over 100 Goldman Sachs investment bankers finds that just 11% of US companies are “actively reducing headcount due to AI,” a report published last week said. However, that figure rises to 31% for tech, media and telecom companies.
Goldman Sachs bankers expect AI will lead to “modest headcount reductions” of 4% over the next year. But that number could rise to 11% over the next three years – especially in customer service jobs.
Jan Hatzius, Goldman’s chief economist, wrote that the findings support the bank’s view that AI will have a “transformative impact on the labor market and economy,” and that rapid adoption signals that “AI impacts on the US labor market could arrive sooner than expected.”
The AI boom has also raised worries about a bubble forming in this red-hot part of the market.
Solomon said that while many “great companies” will be formed during the AI boom, at some point the exuberance could get overdone and it won’t be a “straight line up” in value.
One scenario he laid out is that demand for AI services may at some point fail to reach lofty expectations, driving valuations down.
But that process could take time to play out because, as Solomon noted, most public tech companies are well-established and the newer AI companies are largely still in private markets, where valuation markdowns only change slowly.
“The technology is exciting – there should be a lot of enthusiasm for it,” Solomon said. “But there will be bumps along the way, too.”

"So long, peak oil: World demand could now grow until 2050, a top agency says",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/business/oil-demand-2050-iea-intl,"Nov 12, 2025, 10:12 AM ET","Global demand for oil and natural gas could grow until 2050, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, departing from previous expectations of a speedy transition to cleaner fuels following UScriticism of its climate focus.
The IEA also predicted in its annual outlook that the world would likely fail to meet its goal to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change.
The Paris-based energy security watchdog has been under pressure from the United States for a shift in recent years toward a focus on clean energy policies as President Donald Trump called on American companies to expand oil and gas production.
During the Biden administration, the IEA predicted that global oil demand would peak this decade and said there should be an end to investment in new oil, gas and coal projects if the world wanted to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century.
Trump’s Energy Secretary Chris Wright has called the IEA’s demand peak projections “nonsensical.” The agency is funded by member countries, with the US the largest contributor.
In its World Energy Outlook published Wednesday, the IEA predicted that under a “current policies scenario” oil demand would hit 113 million barrels per day by mid-century, up around 13% from 2024 consumption.
The scenario – which the IEA first used in 2019 before switching to one more in line with a clean energy transition – is based on existing government policies and not aspirations to achieve climate goals.
IEA head Fatih Birol said on a press call the scenario had been restored to reflect differing choices governments were making about energy.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has previously disputed peak oil demand forecasts.
“We hope… we have passed the peak in the misguided notion of ‘peak oil.’” OPEC said on its website Wednesday.
In the IEA’s “stated policies scenario,” which considers proposed but not necessarily adopted policies, oil demand peaks around 2030.
The agency says its scenarios explore a range of possible outcomes under various sets of assumptions and are not forecasts.
Final investment decisions for new liquefied natural gas projects have surged in 2025, the report noted. Operations for about 300 billion cubic meters of new annual LNG export capacity will start by 2030, marking a 50% increase in available supply.
Based on the current policies scenario, the global LNG market increases from around 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035 and to 1,020 bcm in 2050, driven by rising power sector demand fueled by data center and artificial intelligence growth.
Global investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion in 2025, the report said, noting that if achieved this would surpass the $540 billion a year spent globally on oil supply.
The report includes a scenario describing a pathway to reduce global energy emissions to net zero by 2050.
More than 190 countries pledged at the Paris climate talks in 2015 to try to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
But the report shows the world surpassing that in all scenarios."
Layoff announcements surged last month: The worst October in 22 years,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/economy/job-layoff-announcements-challenger,"Nov 6, 2025, 7:03 AM ET","Company announcements of layoffs in the United States surged in October as AI continued to disrupt the labor market.
Announced job cuts last month climbed by more than 153,000, according to a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday, up 175% from the same month a year earlier and the highest October increase since 2003. Layoff announcements surpassed more than a million in first 10 months of this year, an increase of 65% compared to the same period last year.
“This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008. Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” the report said.
The outplacement and executive coaching firm said America’s labor market continued to normalize after a pandemic-era boom, but also cited “AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs” as key factors putting companies under pressure.
Indeed, major companies such as Amazon and Targethave announced major layoffsin recent months, with several of them citing AI. However, announcements of layoffs don’t immediately translate to higher unemployment.
The government shutdown is now the longest - and likely the most damaging in US history
It’s also been complicated to assess the labor market’s health because of the government shutdown, which has now become the longest on record: Official economic statistics have been suspended since the beginning of October, including the Labor Department’s closely watched employment report, which includes the unemployment rate and monthly payroll growth numbers.
The September jobs report, which was scheduled for October 3, hasn’t been released and there will not be an October jobs report this month; it was originally scheduled for Friday. That has made it difficult for economic policymakers, such as Federal Reserve officials, to make important decisions.
Investors and policymakers now look to alternative data, such as Wednesday’s private-sectorpayroll data from ADP, along with the Challenger report, to understand the state of the US economy.
But, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference last month, private data cannot replace government figures, which are widely known as the “gold standard” of measuring the world’s largest economy. And the persistent absence of those figures could derail monetary policymaking and put future rate cuts at risk.
“There’s a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious,” Powell said."
Americans are feeling worse about the economy as government shutdown drags on,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/07/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-november,"Nov 7, 2025, 10:08 AM ET","The record-breaking government shutdown has left Americans feeling worse about the economic outlook. That’s according to the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, which showed the index falling to 50.3 this month from 53.6 in October.
It’s the lowest level since June 2022, which marked the lowest reading on record since the survey’s inception in the 1950s.
“With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” Joanne Hsu, director of surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement.
The drop this month represents a 6.2% decline from October and a 29.9% decline compared to last November. Meanwhile, economists polled by FactSet had been anticipating a slight improvement this month.
“The index certainly looks like the economy is ready to roll over the proverbial cliff,” Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, said in commentary issued Friday.
The increased level of pessimism was “widespread” across different ages, income levels and political affiliations, Hsu noted. The one notable exception was consumers who are heavily invested in the stock market. They reported an 11% improvement in sentiment as the stock market hangs near record highs.
That group of consumers is crucial because they have “the biggest influence on the aggregate consumer spending data, so continued strength here is important for the resilience of the economy overall,” Thomas Simmons, chief US economist at Jefferies, said in a note to clients Friday.
“However, that middle tercile is important too, and the decline in their sentiment appears to be intensifying. If this group is unable to continue to keep up their pace of spending, the top-line growth numbers may finally break from their above-trend pace,” he said.

Candidate Trump vowed to make America affordable again. President Trump says it’s a ‘scam’,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/business/prices-trump-affordable-jobs,"Dec 5, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump has repeatedly argued the affordability issue is anepic “scam”conjured up by Democrats.
“It’s a con job. I think affordability is the greatest con job,” Trumpsaidfrom the Oval Office on Tuesday.
It’s a bizarre argument on many levels, especially since Trump is about to travel to Pennsylvania on Tuesday to promote his economic agenda and his continued focus on “ending Joe Biden’s inflation crisis,” a White House official told CNN.
And for Trump, calling affordability a scam is doubly strange because it’sthe very issuethat helpedpropel him back to the White House.
Trump successfully tapped into anger over the cost of living in the 2024 election and promised voters he would swiftly bring down prices – even if that wasnever realistic in the first place.
Candidate Trump used remarkably similar language to what President Trump now dismisses as a hoax.
“Inflation is destroying our country,” Trump said during anAugust rally in North Carolinaafterholding up Tic-Tacsto highlight shrinkflation, when companies charge the same for a smaller amount of product. “We will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues.”
Trump said at that rally he would instruct his Cabinet to deliver results “within the first 100 days,” if not earlier.
Weeks later during a rally inMontana, Trump promised to bring down “prices of all goods.”
“Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,” Trump said in a line that herepeated in late Septemberin Pennsylvania.
The No. 3 promise in the 2024 Republican Party platformreads: “END INFLATION, AND MAKE AMERICA AFFORDABLE AGAIN.”
Last month, Trump returned to the matter, briefly, in the hours after Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey won key racesin part by focusing on affordability.
“Affordability is our goal,” Trumppostedon Truth Social on November 5.
Dismissing affordability as a scam is impossible to square with official economic statistics, independent research, alternative measures and pubic polling.
Just 21% of US adults in November described current economic conditions as excellent or good, down from 24% in October and the lowest percentage since March, according to aGallup pollreleased Thursday. Far more, 40%, now say conditions are poor, up from 37% in October.
Relatedly, Gallup’s Economic Confidence Index dropped in November to its weakest reading since July 2024.
Although Trump has dismissed polls as “fake,” Wall Street research backs up these feelings.
Consider that roughly 24% of US households areliving paycheck to paycheck, according to Bank of America estimates.
And Fitch Ratings has found that the percentage of subprime borrowers who arelate on car loanshas doubled to all-time highs, surpassing even levels during Covid or the Great Recession.
Of course, affordability didn’t suddenly become a problem as soon as Trump took office. It’s a years-long issue, one that intensified in historic fashion during former President Joe Biden’s term when a variety of factors conspired to drive inflation to a 40-year high of 9.1% in 2022
Those years of inflation have now snowballed into a higher overall level of prices, frustrating Americans whose paychecks don’t go as far as they used to. Consumers must spend more to get the same, orsometimes less.
Each month the typical US household must now spend $208 more than they did in September 2024 to buy the same goods and services, according to Moody’s Analytics data based on the September inflation report.
That’s almost $2,500 in increased costs per year – for the same amount of groceries, electricity, childcare and other items.
And it’s even worse compared to pre-Biden-era inflation: Each month, the typical household is spending $1,043 more than they did in January 2021 for the same goods and services, according to Moody’s Analytics.
Wages are up – but for many people, not by enough to cover higher prices and save.
That’s what Americans are experiencing, not the fact inflation is at 3% instead of 9%.
But the cost-of-living news isn’t all bad: Gas pricesdropped below $3 a gallonthis week for the first time in four and a half years, according to AAA. It’s a major improvement from the spike to $5 a gallon in 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices skyrocketing.
Part of Trump’s bind is that his favorite economic tool – massive tariffs – are unpopular and viewed as part of the affordability problem.
Economists say they have contributed to price hikes on everything fromcoffee and bananasto car repair andclothing, albeit less than expected.
As of November 1, prices were nearly 6% higher than the pre-tariff trend, according to theHarvard Business School Pricing Lab. Some prices were up even more: furnishings/household equipment and household maintenance (9%), clothing and footwear (15.9%) and coffee/tea/cocoa (9.2%).
And the more the public sees of tariffs, the less they like them. A clear majority, 62%, opposed new tariffs on imports in aCBS News pollin late October. That’s up from 48% who opposed tariffs in aCBS polllast fall.
None of those numbers are helpful for a president who loves import taxes so much that hedubbed himself the Tariff Man.
And Trump’s campaign promises were unrealistic even before he took office. Consumer prices rarely come down en masse – unless there are larger economic issues at play, like a recession.
The best case all along has been that prices would increase so gradually that they’re barely noticed and dwarfed by pay hikes.
The bottom line is Trump faces an almost impossible task in trying to convince Americans the affordability crisis they experience each day doesn’t exist. After all, Candidate Trump told them it does."
Saudi Arabia is making a massive bet on becoming a global AI powerhouse,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/tech/saudi-arabia-ai-powerhouse,"Nov 2, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Saudi Arabia is turning its oil wealth toward its massive AI ambitions.
Its chief investment vehicle is Humain, a homegrown company that is building out a full stack of data centers, cloud capabilities, large language models and applications. It’s owned by the Kingdom’s nearly $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund.
Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salmanunveiled Humain in Mayahead of President Donald Trump’sstate visit to Riyadh. This week, at the annual Future Investment Initiative in the same location, the scale, ambition and deep pockets behind the project came into clearer focus.
Humain CEO, Tareq Amin, is setting out to make Saudi Arabia the world’s third-largest AI market, after the United States and China. It’s a bold ambition for a newcomer to the industry, but Amin argues the Kingdom’s competitive edge lies in its abundant and cheap energy resources that can feed the seemingly insatiable demand for computing power.
“We have an advantage in Saudi Arabia,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “Look at this country’s amazing energy grid that doesn’t require a company like Humain to build the substations and the power to deliver that to a data center. That means I have saved 18 months of time.”
Saudi Arabia makes an AI play with Humain
Humain plans to build up to six gigawatts in data center capability across the country by 2034, with a rolodex of key AI partners, including Nvidia, AMD, Amazon Web Services, Qualcomm and Cisco.
On Tuesday, Humain announced a$3 billion dealwith private equity giant Blackstone to build data centers in the Kingdom.
It also publicly launchedHumain One, an AI-powered operating system where users speak or type to a computer to tell it to perform tasks, rather than clicking on icons, as is conventional in systems like Windows or iOS.
Humain has been using the AI system internally to run much of its HR, finance, legal, operational and IT departments. Amin says there is now only one employee in his payroll department, with AI agents handling the rest.
The Kingdom is entering the closing stretch of its Vision 2030 economic transformation plan facing headwinds from declining oil prices and delays in its construction of giga-projects like Neom, placing new urgency on its AI push to support the growth of the Arab world’s largest economy.
It alsofaces competitionfrom the neighboring United Arab Emirates, which has its own AI vehicle, G42, and recently secured a landmark deal with the Trump administration to build “Stargate UAE,” a sprawling $500 billion data center project billed as the largest outside the United States, with the help of OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco.
Asked whether there’s room for two regional heavyweights, Amin said he supports democratizing AI, while touting Humain’s robust operations.
“It is good for humanity to have knowledge — especially around AI — not to be all centralized in one location. So it’s good what is happening in the UAE. It’s very good what’s happening in Saudi Arabia,” he said. “I will tell you what we decided to do, which is very different … Humane is not a holding company. We are an operating company.”"
"With Nancy Pelosi retiring, stock traders who copy her investments need to find a new hero",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/stock-tracker-nancy-pelosi-investors,"Nov 6, 2025, 3:14 PM ET","There’s a cottage industry of investors who monitor former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s disclosed stock trades, match her every move, and usually make a profit along the way.
That trend will now end in 2027. Pelosi announced Thursday thatshe is retiringafter a storied four-decade career in Congress, and she won’t run for re-election in next year’s midterms. Once she leaves Congress, she won’t be required to publicly reveal anything about her family’s stock holdings.
The California Democrat is one of the wealthiest members of Congress and one of the best-known investors on Capitol Hill. In the last three years, her disclosed trades had a volume of about $59 million, according to data fromCapitol Trades, which tracks lawmakers from both parties.
There isno prohibitionagainst members of Congress owning or buying stocks. But federal law requires lawmakers to disclose – within 45 days – their transactions, and any transactions by their spouse or children, or any stock activity done on their behalf. They report their transactions in value ranges, not exact amounts.
Most of the Pelosi-linked trades are done by her husband, Paul Pelosi, as made clear in federal disclosures. A spokesperson from Pelosi’s officesaidin 2022 that she isn’t involved in her husband’s investment decisions.
A collection of financial experts, day traders, political junkies and others have closely watched the Pelosis’ trades and matched their investments. A “Nancy Pelosi Stock Tracker”accounton X, formerly Twitter, has amassed 1.2 million followers.
Among those Pelosi-watchers is Dan Weiskopf, a senior portfolio manager at Tidal Financial Group, who oversees an ETF fund whose ticker symbol isaptly called “NANC.”That fund invests in stocks that are bought or sold by not just Pelosi, but all Democratic members of Congress. (He also manages an ETF fund called “GOP,” which does the same for Republican lawmakers.)
“It’s amazing – when Nancy Pelosi makes a trade, the community immediately hops on it, and it’ll move that market,” Weiskopf said of the Pelosis’ transactions. “So many people are following her decision-making. Other members of Congress have less of an impact.”
The NANC fund has about $263 million in net assets, while the GOP fund has about $60 million, according to their website. Both were launched in 2023. Weiskopf said both of his congressional-based portfolios have largelyoutperformedthe S&P 500.
“What’s wonderful about her trades is that she’s got such conviction in the way she trades, because she’s using long-dated options” that are still active even after the delayed disclosures, Weiskopf said. “She has done really well, so why wouldn’t you want to follow her?”
Pelosi has alwaysdenied any wrongdoing,and has rejected assertions that lawmakers may be using non-public information to gain a financial advantage. Defending her own family’s trades, she said in 2021, when pressed on her seemingly well-timed trades: “We are a free market economy, (lawmakers) should be able to participate in that.”
Government ethics groups have been lobbying for years to ban lawmaker stock trading, which is legal as long as trades are disclosed, and it isn’t isolated to just Pelosi or one political party. Amid public pressure, Pelosiannounced her supportin 2022 for bipartisan efforts to ban congressional stock trading, which have beenslowly gaining steamthroughout the year.
There are a handful of proposals being floated in Congress by progressive lawmakers like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. But conservatives like Rep. Chip Roy and Sen. Josh Hawley have also signed on to some of these bills.
These developments – and new support this year from President Donald Trump and the congressional leadership from both parties – has given advocates optimism for potential passage through the Republican-led Congress.
Pelosireaffirmed her supportfor a congressional stock-trading ban earlier this year, even after Senate Republicans renamed one of the bills the “PELOSI Act.” That hasn’t stopped her family from trading, including a recently disclosedtransferof at least $100,000 in Apple stock by her husband on Oct. 22. The shares were donated to a Catholic university in Washington, DC.
“She does impact the markets when her trading is disclosed,” Weiskopf said. “Her retirement is notable, but there are plenty of other members of Congress who will continue the trend.”

A new threat to affordability – just in time for winter,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/business/winter-heat-energy-prices,"Dec 10, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","A new problem is threatening to worsen theaffordability squeezethis winter: Natural gas prices have raced back up just as extreme cold forces Americans to crank up the heat.
President Donald Trump has said he’s focused on lowering energy prices. And the most visible energy price for most Americans, gasoline at the pump, has been aclear bright spoton the cost-of-living front.
But the progress on gas prices could be offset by the 39% spike in natural gas futures since the end of September. Natural gas recently climbed to the highest level since December 2022 before retreating sharply this week.
It’s a double whammy for consumers.
First, natural gas is the most common way to heat homes in America. The higher natural gas prices go, the more expensive it will be for many families to stay warm this winter.
Secondly, natural gas is by far the No. 1 fuel source powering the nation’s electric grid. Higher natural gas prices could exacerbate the sticker shock consumers are already experiencing when they open their electric bills.
“All that money the consumer is saving on gasoline may be eaten up by the soaring price of natural gas,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates.
The good news is that after jumping on Friday, natural gas prices have tumbled 13% this week.
Still, even at current levels, natural gas is nearly 50% more expensive than at this point last year.
Natural gas prices are extremely volatile, and analysts say it’s unclear at this point whether prices will continue to retreat or resume their recent climb.
Government forecasts don’t expect natural gas to crash back to earth anytime soon.
The Energy Information Administrationramped up its natural gas price forecastby about 10% on Tuesday from its November forecast, citing the “cold snap” in the United States that will drive up demand for heating.
After averaging just $2.19 per million BTU in 2024, the EIA expects natural gas to average $3.56 this year and $4.01 in 2026.
It takes time for those higher natural gas prices to filter through to Americans’ utility bills.
Households that use natural gas for heating are expected to experience a 3% jump in heating prices this winter, according to the EIA. That’s despite the fact that consumption is expected to be 2% lower.
The biggest price hikes are expected in the Northeast (4%) and the Midwest (7%), whereas heating costs in the West are forecasted to be flat and down 3% in the South.
This isn’t just a wintertime problem.
Higher natural gas prices will contribute to higher electric bills.
According to federal data, natural gas accounts for about 40% of US electricity generation – more than the next two fuel sources, coal and nuclear, combined.
Electricity prices have already been rising sharply.
Residential electricity prices increased by 7.4% over the 12 months ending in September, the most recent monthfederal datais available. That’s more than twice the rate of inflation.
But the sticker shock is even greater in certain states, including Virginia (9%) and New Jersey (21%), two states where Democrats seized upon the issue in key gubernatorial wins last month.
So why is natural gas getting more expensive?
Part of the problem is supply.
Analysts say natural gas producers, especially public ones, have been apprehensive to ramp up production out of fear they’ll cause a supply glut that crashes prices.
“They’ve been burned badly before. No one wants that to happen again. There is a certain degree of reluctance,” said Robert Yawger, commodity specialist at Mizuho Securities.
Another factor: cheap oil.
Natural gas is a byproduct of drilling for crude oil. But oil drilling has slowed in recent months because crude is relatively inexpensive. That means so-called associated natural gas could take a hit. (Of course, cheap oil has helped keep a lid on prices for homes that rely on home heating oil to stay warm.)
On the demand side, a relatively new phenomenon is that a significant chunk of natural gas produced in the United States is getting shipped overseas as liquified natural gas (LNG).
The EIA expects LNG exports to average 16.3 billion cubic feet per day next year, up 37% from 2024.
LNG exports are helping to supply US allies with relatively inexpensive energy, including European nations attempting to wean themselves off Russian gas.
But that also leaves less natural gas for Americans.
“That’s obviously contributing. These are molecules going overseas that were historically going to the consumer in the United States,” said Yawger, who estimates about 15% to 20% of the natural gas is getting exported.
New LNG export facilities are being built and slated to come online soon, potentially adding to demand.
Yawger emphasized that, at the end of the day, there’s no risk of running out of natural gas. If Americans need to produce more natural gas, it can be done relatively quickly.
But it could take a period of higher prices to encourage that production.
Another factor on the demand side: Artificial intelligence.
The data centers that act as the brains of the AI boom are sucking up enormous amounts of power – including natural gas.
“This is demand that I don’t think the market really anticipated as recently as a year ago,” said Patrick Rau, senior vice president of research and analysis at Natural Gas Intelligence."
Supreme Court divided over GOP-led effort to lift campaign spending caps,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/politics/supreme-court-debate-gop-effort-lift-campaign-spending-caps,"Dec 9, 2025, 6:01 AM ET","The Supreme Court on Tuesday left open the possibility that it might raise caps on how much moneypolitical parties may spend in coordinationwith candidates in a case initially filed by then-Senate candidate JD Vance.
But after more than two hours of oral arguments — and warnings that the court’s decision could upend the way American campaigns are funded — it was not clear which way the court would rule. Several key justices asked only a few questions, possibly keeping their options open.
Republicans who are challenging the regulations walked into the Supreme Court with the upper hand given that the court has repeatedly struck down other campaign finance rules. And at least a few of the court’s conservative justices appeared willing to do so again.
“I am concerned, as you said, that the combination of campaign finance laws and this court’s decisions over the years, together, have reduced the power of political parties as compared to outside groups with negative effects on our constitutional democracy,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, picking up an argument from the GOP campaign groups that lifting the caps might help funnel more money into traditional parties rather than to super PACs.
Kavanaugh, a conservative, said he is also concerned about the arguments from opponents who say lifting the caps might encourage corruption.
Critics say the justices should dismiss the case, in part because Vance hasn’t offered any concrete plans to run for president in 2028. But that argument, which would give the court an out to avoid deciding the more fundamental questions raised by the case, appeared to get little traction Tuesday.
Trump’s lawyer pushed for more executive power; Supreme Court justices seem eager to comply
In 2022, Vance and several party committees — including the National Republican Senatorial Committee — challenged the law as a violation of the First Amendment. Roman Martinez, who was appointed by the court to defend the caps, said the Republican groups’ arguments would create a slippery slope that would lead to challenges of other campaign finance caps.
“The dominos are going to fall and you’re going to have to reconstruct campaign finance law from the ground up,” Martinez warned the court.
Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, brushed that suggestion aside, calling it “speculative” and noting that the court had only “one provision before us today.”
The cap at issue involves money spent by parties, such as on advertising, in coordination with a candidate. For 2024, the limits ranged from $123,600 to $3,772,100 for Senate candidates, and from $61,800 to $123,600 for House candidates, according to court records. The caps change based on the office sought, the voting-age population and inflation.
Super PACs, by contrast, may collect unlimited funds but they may not coordinate with the campaign they’re attempting to help, which means they sometimes run advertising that is not directly on message with what the candidate wants.
Campaign finance experts and the Democratic groups that have intervened in the case argue that lifting the caps would effectively open a loophole around limits on how much donors may give to federal candidates.
Deep-pocketed donors could instead give tens of thousands of dollars each year to party committees with the understanding that the money be spent on a given candidate.
The court’s three liberal justices — Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — appeared united in opposition to the GOP groups.
“Every time we interfere with the congressional design, we make matters worse,” Sotomayor said. “Our tinkering causes more harm than it does good.”
A divided6th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the capsbut made clear it might have ruled differently if it was “faced with a clear playing field” rather than the 2001 precedent that previously upheld the caps.
In an unusual move, the Justice Department, representing the Federal Election Commission, told the Supreme Court earlier this year it would not defend the caps. The court then named Martinez to defend the 6th Circuit decision.
Calling the case a “walking vehicle problem” Martinez has argued the court should dismiss it on technical grounds. For one thing, Martinez has argued, Vance is no longer affected by the caps because he’s offered coy public statements about whether he is planning to run for federal office.
“Isn’t that what potential candidates always say until the day when they make the announcement?” Alito said. “That’s what they always say.”
A decision is expected before the end of June.

The secret behind your skyrocketing energy costs,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/climate/electricity-bills-high-infrastructure-wires-demand-cost,"Dec 4, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","Stephanie Tate couldn’t figure it out. After three years of living in her new Illinois home, her winter energy costs last year suddenly spiked to $400 per month.
She had three different technicians come to look at her HVAC system and furnace, but nothing was wrong with it. She had her home insulation inspected and found no issues. She installed new, energy efficient windows to stop cold air from leaking into the house.
“It still didn’t make a dent,” she said.
In the summer, her bills were even higher, driven by the cost of the electricity needed to run her air conditioner. Tate tried to use her heat and cooling sparingly in hot and cold months.
“In the winter, I keep my heat well below 68 — and it gets cold here, so you just bundle up,” Tate said. “In the summer, my AC is at 75. I’m dealing with a little warm weather inside my house.”
Diving into her bills, Tate found something surprising. Her electricity bill’s delivery fees — the costs customers pay to help maintain electric infrastructure like the poles and wires carrying power to their homes — were often just as high as the cost of the electricity she used.
What goes into your skyrocketing energy bills
“That’s ridiculous,” she said. “You’re paying more for everything right now, and the electrical costs — the way they increase so exponentially and so quickly is stunning to me.”
Around the country, customers like Tate are getting sticker shock when they open their monthly utility bills. Since last September, residential electricity rates nationwide increased by 7.4%, according to the federalEnergy Information Administration. Tate’s home state of Illinois had the third-highest increase nationwide, with a 20.6% jump year-over-year, behind the District of Columbia and New Jersey.
And electricity rates themselves — a bill’s “supply charges,” — don’t explain the total increase, because they don’t include those electric infrastructure “delivery charges” like Tate found.
Cost increases in Tate’s area are largely about the cost of generating electricity, said a spokesperson for Ameren, the Illinois and Missouri-based utility that Tate uses. The company doesn’t generate power itself in Illinois, and has to buy it from third-party suppliers, which can result in big price fluctuations during high-demand times, like summer.
But, like many other utilities, Ameren is also “investing in strengthening and modernizing the grid,” the spokesperson said. Increasingly, the costs of meeting those goals are showing up on utility bills around the country.
Customers often think of their utility bill as a measure of the energy they use to keep the lights on, and heat and cool their homes. But it’s also a reflection of what their utility is building or upgrading. Across the country, the rising costs of updating aging energy infrastructure are inflating bills.
The nation’s electricity infrastructure is old, and utilities across the country have recently been pouring money into upgrading it; in just five years, US utilities increased their spending by $5 billion on transmission (the massive high-voltage towers carrying electricity from one region to another) and another $16 billion on distribution (the smaller substations, poles and wires).
Electric utilities are making “essential investments” to strengthen the grid, said Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, an electric utility trade group.
“Our electric grid is America’s most important machine — and we have to make sure it works reliably every day for families, businesses, and local communities,” Maloney said in a statement to CNN.
Part of that investment is driven by new demand growth. Electricity demand in the US used to be pretty flat. Now, demand is exploding primarily from data centers, along with new manufacturing and home and vehicle electrification. Power demand from data centers alone is projected to reach 106 gigawatts in the next decade,according to a reportfrom research firm BloombergNEF.
“Over the last decade or two, we’ve been able to get by with the grid that we have,” said Ryan Hledik, a principal at the research and consulting firm Brattle Group and author of a recent study on electricity prices. “The unfortunate thing is, we’ve been needing to make those investments to basically tread water and keep the grid as reliable as it has been in the past, at a time when the cost of that equipment has been getting more expensive.”
New demand is coming at a pricey time for upgrades. The Covid-19 pandemic thrust global supply chains into chaos and made everything more expensive. As a result, the cost of some electrical equipment like transformers has risen faster than the rate of inflation, Hledik said.
Electrical systems have also taken beatings from flooding, high winds and wildfires, and companies often need to invest more to try to make systems more resilient to future storms.
“The grid is being updated, but it’s definitely still old,” Hledik said. “We’re continuing to confront the reality of more volatile weather conditions. So, it’s not my expectation that the need for this investment is going to be finished” anytime soon.
In some cities around the country, the same is true for the network of gas pipelines that deliver winter heating fuel to millions of homes. There was a customer outcry in Baltimore earlier this year as winter heating costs shot monthly bills above $1,000 for some residents.
Those spikes related to seasonal heating needs were also driven by the cost of replacing (extremely) old equipment. Baltimore Gas and Electric operates the oldest gas system in the country and is replacing hundreds of miles of the most ancient, leakiest iron and steel pipes in the ground,CNN recently reported. One pipe scheduled for replacement this year was first installed during Ulysses S. Grant’s presidency in the 1800s, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos told CNN.
“Our hundreds of miles of century-old gas main is far past the end of its useful life,” Alexopulos said. “We’ve got to upgrade this system.”
BGE crews have already replaced around 600 miles of elderly metal pipes with new, plastic ones and have around 800 miles left to complete, Alexopulos said.
In Illinois, Stephanie Tate got so fed up with her electricity bills that she decided this year to take the plunge and outfit her house with solar panels and a battery storage system, which she expects to be producing power soon.
Tate said she was “stunned” at how expensive her home solar and battery system was, but she expects state and federal tax credits and rebates will cover half of the cost. She plans to pay off the remaining balance in a year and expects the new system will save her thousands of dollars per year on her utility bills.
“I’m extraordinarily excited,” she told CNN. “Every day it’s sunny outside, I’m like, ‘oh gosh, I missed this day with solar. I wish it was up now so that I could reap the benefits.’”
She’s looking forward to having a cooler temperature in her house this summer and also anticipating a more reliable home system that will keep her power on during severe spring storms that can knock electricity out for days.
“Those batteries will run even when Ameren is offline,” Tate said.
She’s hopeful she’ll see her monthly bill reduced to a shell of its former self. However, Tate won’t be completely off the grid; she’ll still have to pay delivery fees to Ameren to remain connected to their system, even as she’s generating and storing her own power. Nevertheless, she remains optimistic.
“I’m just incredibly frustrated with the high bills,” she said. “It doesn’t seem logical that they should be this high, this quick.”
Switching to solar and batteries is “a leap of faith,” she said.

The affordability crisis is forcing Trump to radically reshape his economic plan on the fly,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/14/business/cost-of-living-affordability-plan-trump,"Nov 14, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump swept into office with a bold plan toremake America’s economy. But the realities of a persistentaffordability crisis, low favorability ratings and biting election losses for his Republican party are forcing him to remake his plan on the fly.
Although still in the early stages, Trump’s Plan B appears to be a spaghetti-on-the-wall strategy that includes $2,000 tariff rebate checks, 50-year and portable mortgages and lower tariffs on common grocery items.
Each tactic comes with significant question marks – and some are so radical economists fear they could squeeze Americans’ finances even more.
The original Trump economic plan was based onthree bold assumptions:
For the plan to come to fruition, all three parts had to work perfectly. That’s because each part relied on the other. If one leg of the stool was loose, the whole thing would topple over.
As it turns out, some parts didn’t work.
Boosted by deregulation of AI companies and tax cuts, the stock market has roared higher. But consumer prices haven’t fallen – they’ve continued to rise. Inflation remains relatively low, but it is picking up, in part because of tariffs.
High-profile corporate promises to invest in US manufacturing could take years to bear fruit. Meanwhile, the tax cuts and deregulation have failed to persuade American businesses to make the level of investment that the Trump administration had hoped for. Overall hiring in the United States has come to a standstill in recent months.
Bond yields have fallen but not enough to make a major difference. Mortgage rates remain above 6%, and the number of subprime borrowers defaulting on their auto loans hasdoubled over the past four years, according to Fitch Ratings.
It may be early to judge Trump’s economic plan less than a year into his second term, but Americans are increasingly fed up. A recentCNN poll conducted by SSRSshowed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 61% say Trump’s policies are making the economy worse. A Democratic sweep of this month’s elections showed a significant leftward shift in former Trump voters and proved affordability was front and center in voters’ minds when they went the polls.
Now, a new plan is emerging.
Tariff dividends:Trump last weekend floated the idea of$2,000 tariff rebate checks, a proposal he’s mused about before but which seemed to initially catch his advisers off guard this time. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, doubled and tripled down on the proposal this week, saying a plan was actively being considered.
Using tariff revenue to issue a kind of stimulus check would need congressional approval, and that may be a tough sell when inflation is on the rise again. Economists warn that sending households thousands of dollars could trigger a rush of demand for goods without adding supply to the market. That imbalance could raise prices even more,exacerbating inflation.
50-year mortgages:Trump this week acknowledged that his administration is considering a50-year mortgage, which could lower homebuyers’ monthly premiums by drastically extending the length of their home loans. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal “a complete game changer.”
But critics argue that a 50-year mortgage will ensure many borrowersnever actually own their homes. Money that some borrowers could have saved for retirement would end up paid to banks in the form of higher interest payments. The length of the loan also means the total interest ultimately paid on a loan would jump.
All of that could harm Americans’ long-term financial security.
Portable mortgages:Pulte this week said the Trump administration was considering aportable mortgage, which would allow borrowers to maintain their existing, lower-rate home loans when they purchase a new home. That could potentially thaw the frozen US housing market by giving homeowners the assurance that they could keep their relatively low mortgage payments when they move – even as current mortgage rates remain high.
But industry experts worry that the logistics of a portable mortgage plan could be difficult to overcome. The plan would require borrowers to cover the cost difference between the new home and the old one, which could mean a second mortgage. And it could throw a wrench in the gears of the investment market that keeps the mortgage market flowing, unintentionally raising mortgage rates along the way.
Lowering some tariffs:Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week said that the administration will announcelower tariffs on producethat isn’t grown in the United States, including bananas and coffee. “That will bring the prices down very quickly,” Bessent said.
That could reduce import prices, but it probably won’t have a dramatic effect on consumer prices. So far, businesses have chosen to pay roughly 80% of the tariffs’ cost, according to a recent JPMorgan analysis. And the produce Bessent mentioned may be particularly bad examples: Coffee prices were surging because of climate change, long before tariffs kicked in, and Americans’ fixation on coffee ensures that companies can keep their prices high. Bananas are particularly low-priced fruit that won’t dramatically relieve grocery price pressures.
A significant amount of political capital remains at stake: Trump won reelection on the economy, criticizing former President Joe Biden for failing to address the rising cost of living after the post-pandemic inflation crisis. Trump’s promise to cut prices on Day One was always unrealistic, but his signature economic policy, tariffs, has proven unpopular, as Americans associate the tariffs with higher costs.
Instead, the administration’s policies may be exacerbating the so-calledK-shaped economy, in which wealthier Americans benefit from their growing investments in the stock market while lower-income Americans increasinglylive paycheck to paycheck.
Trump’s immediate reaction to the GOP’s election losses and new polls was denialism: Heclaimed, falsely, that prices have, in fact fallen during his administration.
But the administration is beginning to shift its focus and acknowledge Americans want the White House to do more to address their high cost of living. Administration officials told CNN’s Alayna Treenethat Trump is getting more frequent economic briefingsand has been encouraged to spend more time on domestic travel and policies.
And Bessent this week coined a new Trump-approved phrase: “Make America Affordable Again.” The devil, as always, will be in the details."
Michael Burry of ‘The Big Short’ is back with cryptic messages — and two massive bets,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/05/business/nvidia-palantir-michael-burry-stock,"Nov 5, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","Michael Burry, the famed investor behind “The Big Short,” is betting artificial intelligence is more of a bubble than a revolution.
Burry’s fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed on Monday that it bought puts — bets that share prices will fall — on two stars of the AI wave: Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR). Scion bought roughly $187.6 million in puts on Nvidia and $912 million in puts on Palantir, according to Securities and Exchange Commissionfilings.
Burry is known for his prophetic call that the US housing market would collapse in 2008. He was profiled in the 2010 book “The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,” by Michael Lewis, and portrayed by Christian Bale in the 2015 film adaptation.
Most companies aren’t seeing a return on AI investments. This tech CEO wants to change that
Now Burry is betting against the hottest AI stocks on the market at a time when concerns are mounting about a bubble. Tech and AI stocks have carried the market in recent months.  The S&P 500, which is increasingly concentrated in tech companies, is trading at historically expensive levels.
Meanwhile, thecircular financingof AI deals has raised eyebrows on Wall Street, with many tech companies entwined in a massive web of deals with each other. Some investors are also skeptical whether future profit growth will continue to justify the enormous amounts of spending taking place.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.04% on Tuesday, posting its worst day since August. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell 1.17%.
Burry made a splash among investors on Thursday, when he posted on X for the first time since 2023. In his post, he shared a photo of Bale portraying him in “The Big Short” and wrote: “Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.”
Four days later, Burry’s fund disclosed its bearish positions in Nvidia and Palantir. The SEC filings are for the third quarter of this year. Scion Asset Management did not respond to a request for comment.
Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research, said a pullback in tech stocks was overdue, given how far they have rallied in recent months. He said Burry’s comments likely exacerbated concerns.
Burry has made public calls about the market in the years since “The Big Short.” He has not always been correct. The hedge fund manager in January 2023 infamously posted on X, “Sell,” before posting two months later, “I was wrong to say sell.”
Nonetheless, his words carry weight on Wall Street.
Sometimes, we see bubbles.Sometimes, there is something to do about it.Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.pic.twitter.com/xNBSvjGgvs
Burry’s return to social media comes at a time when investors have voiced concerns about expensive valuations, a market concentrated on a handful of large companies and rising investor expectations.
For example, Palantir beat Wall Street forecasts in earnings reported Monday. Yet it wasn’t enough to impress traders after a series of strong earnings results.
On Tuesday, its shares tumbled 7.95% — their worst day since August.
Palantir was the top performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024 and is in the top five performing stocks this year. Its shares are still up 152% this year.
The company’s earnings results on Monday were “stellar,” according to CFRA Research’s Zino, but the company’s valuation — a measure of how pricey it is — “is a bit extreme.”
Why the Goldman Sachs CEO isn’t buying the AI jobs freakout
“Despite the great results, when you coincide that with the comments that Michael Burry made and everybody already talking about concerns about an AI bubble, I think the combination of those factors really helped drive a pullback in the shares, the broader tech index and as a result the broader markets,” Zino said. “We’re not overly concerned about the pullback, but I would say it’s one of those situations where you’ve got to keep an eye on it.”
Meanwhile, Nvidia shares fell 3.96% on Tuesday. Shares are still up 48% this year.
Alex Karp, CEO at Palantir, told CNBC on Tuesday that people betting against the company — including Burry — are “crazy.”
“When I hear short sellers attacking what I believe is clearly the most important software company in America, therefore in the world, in terms of our impact, … it just is super triggering,” Karp said.
“It’s crazy motivating,” Karp said. “Every time they short us, we are just like tripling down on getting the better numbers, in part honestly, to make them poorer.”"
Trump is threatening to get rid of one of the biggest reasons prices have remained in check,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/economy/trump-usmca-tariffs-prices,"Dec 5, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","When President Donald Trump introduced his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, many economistspredictedAmericans would soon experience massive price increases. While inflationhas ticked upin the eight months that passed, it’s been nowhere near levels initially projected.
A big reason for that: Nearly everything from clothing to toothpaste produced by America’s top two trading partners, Mexico and Canada, has been exempt from duties if goods comply with the terms of a trilateral free-trade agreement known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), whichTrump inked during his first term.
But the deal, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, is scheduled to undergo a review in July, and already Trump is signaling he wants out. If that happens, it likely would usher in a floodgate of higher prices from which Americans have so far been shielded.
“We’ll either let it expire or we’ll maybe work out another deal with Mexico and Canada,” Trump said Wednesday. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also said in a Politico interview, “the reason why we built a review period into USMCA was in case we needed to revise it, review it or exit it.”
The president’s stance could change between now and July, and the White House told CNNthat. “Discussion about what hypothetical trade deals that have not yet been negotiated could look like is meaningless speculation,” spokesman Kush Desai said.
Prior to Trump’s second term, goods from Mexico and Canada essentially entered the US duty-free even if they weren’t USMCA compliant because there weren’t tariffs in place. But Trump introduced tariffs of 25% on non-USMCA-compliant products from Mexico and 35% from Canada.
Trump’s trade war is pushing Canada closer to China
Unlike those two countries, every other nation’s exports to the United States have been subject to higher tariffs over the past year, barring exemptions for certain goods. Those rates at one point went as high as 145% in the case of China.
Prior to Trump’s second term, goods from Mexico and Canada essentially entered the US duty-free even if they weren’t USMCA compliant because there weren’t tariffs in place. That helps explain why 38% of imports from Canada and 49% of imports from Mexico were USMCA compliant last year, according to US Commerce Department data. But as of August this year, those shares rose to nearly 86% of imports from Canada and 87% of imports from Mexico.
“Increased compliance with USMCA has shielded billions of dollars’ worth of imports from the new tariffs,” said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation.
If USMCA exemptions weren’t in place, “Americans would face significantly higher prices,” she said. “That would make American workers poorer and American businesses less competitive, and for no good reason.”
Consumer electronics and clothing are among the goods that could be most vulnerable to price increases, given that the United States has become more reliant on its neighbors for such items.
Additionally, supply chains across all three countries havegrown more intertwined, with components often crossing the American border multiple times during the assembly process. That means that even apparel and electronics, as well as other domestically produced goods, could be impacted by potentially higher tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and get passed on to consumers.
“USMCA is a cornerstone of North America’s electronics manufacturing ecosystem. Terminating it would disrupt the production system that US manufacturers rely on, leading to longer lead times and higher input costs,” said Chris Mitchell, vice president for global government relations at the Global Electronics Association. “Those pressures would ultimately translate into higher prices for automotive, consumer, and medical electronics.”"
Trump announces plan to rescind Biden-era fuel-economy standards for vehicles,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/politics/fuel-economy-standards-rollback-trump,"Dec 3, 2025, 12:21 PM ET","President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled plans to rescind fuel-economy standards for vehicles put in place under the Biden administration.
“These policies forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices, and made the car much worse,” Trump said during an Oval Office event announcing the changes. “The action is expected to save the typical consumer at least $1,000 off the price of a new car, and we think substantially more than that.”
Top auto executives, including the CEOs of For﻿d and Stellantis, along with a General Motors plant manager, were in attendance at the event.
The Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, first established in 1975, set the average fuel economy targets for new vehicles. The Biden administration hadproposed modest increasesto the requirements for the vehicles most Americans drive as part of a push to promote electric vehicles and battle climate change.
Trump condemned the Biden policy as “anti-economy” on Wednesday, with Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy echoing similar criticisms.
“What Democrats were doing were not making cars more affordable. They were making them less affordable,” Duffy said in the Oval Office. “The consequence of that is going to be that more Americans can afford to buy a new car.”
The new standards, he said, will increase road safety and help automakers create new jobs.
“The more cars we sell, the more jobs we have in this country,” Duffy said.
In a statement ahead of the gathering, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised the administration’s move and emphasized the company’s support for revising federal requirements.
“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability. This is a win for customers and common sense,” Farley said.
Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa offered similar support, framing the changes as better aligned with consumer demand.
“Stellantis appreciates the Trump Administration’s actions to re-align the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards with real world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing US automotive industry. We look forward to working further with NHTSA on environmentally responsible policies that also allow us to offer our customers the freedom to choose the vehicles they want at prices they can afford,” Filosa said.

"With the end of the penny, is the clock ticking for the nickel?",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/16/business/penny-nickel-discontinue-currency,"Nov 16, 2025, 3:00 AM ET","The American penny is history. The nickel might be next.
Thelast pennies were pressedat the US Mint in Philadelphia on Wednesday, a victim of production costs higher than their worth coupled with limited usefulness. While the penny remains legal tender, banks and merchants are already reporting shortages.
But the factors that prompted the government to stop making pennies are even truer for the nickel. Pennies cost nearly 5 cents to make – 4 cents more than they’re worth. The nickel’s net loss is nearly 9 cents per coin.
Nickels are 75% copper and 25% nickel, while pennies — despite their reputation as a copper coin — are copper-plated zinc, meaning they are 97.5% zinc and only 2.5% copper.
While metal prices can be volatile, zinc costs about the same as it did in late 2016; copper and nickel prices cost roughly double since then.
The US Mint and one of its suppliers, Artazn, have been studying ways to get the cost of making a nickel down to less than 5 cents, said Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents. The pro-penny group is funded primarily by Artazn, which describes itself as one of the world’s oldest and largest producers of solid zinc strip and zinc products. Artazn makes the blanks used by the US Mint to press coins.
“It just so happens that copper and nickel are two of the more expensive metals you could be using,” Weller said. Getting nickel production costs to close to 5 cents per coin could be completed within a year, he said, with a “new” nickel that looks identical to the current nickel.
But the nickel’s problems don’t end with the production costs. Like the penny, the nickel is limited in its usefulness. Americans are using coins less and less often, even when they use cash.
Other countries were quicker to retire their small-change coins. New Zealand and Australia both eliminated the production of their nickels in the early years of this century and within 20 years of when they stopped making their pennies.
Using cash less often reduces the pressure to drop the nickel, as would reducing the cost of production, said David Smith, a professor of economics at the Graziadio School of Business and Management at Pepperdine University. Smith, an avid coin collector, also thinks there is enough nostalgia for thecoins to slow any move toward eliminating them. But he believes it will eventually happen, even if it takes 15 or 20 years.
Weller said getting rid of coins and moving toward a cashless economy causes problems, especially for lower income consumers.
“The move away from cash really benefits big banks and credit card companies,” he said. “They’re charging businesses every time someone swipes their cards, and those costs end up being passed onto consumers.”
Merchants dealing with a penny shortage are trying to figure out whether they’re allowed to round purchases to the nearest 5 cents and have called on Congress to pass legislation to confirm the move.
Rounding cash purchases to the nearest 10 cents rather than the nearest 5 cents could cause additional problems. A study earlier this year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond found that while rounding purchases to the nearest nickel would cost American consumers a total of $6 million a year, the similar “rounding tax” from eliminating nickels and going to the nearest dime would be $56 million.
But even that would come to only an average 42 cents for each of the nation’s 133 million households.
And changing the nickel’s composition wouldn’t eliminate all production cost concerns. Even if a “new” nickel cost less than 5 cents, it’ll be tough to stay below that level, especially since 2.8 cents of the cost of each nickel comes from administrative and distribution costs, not materials and production.
Both Weller and Smith don’t expect the nickel to go away anytime soon. The Mint lost money on every penny and every nickel it had made since 2006, Weller said, and it only stopped making pennies this year.
“I’ve had reporters calling me about the future of the penny for the last 30 or 35 years,” Weller said. “So I don’t see there being an immediate change.”"
"China’s military firms struggle as corruption purge bites, report says",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/30/business/china-military-firms-struggle-purge-intl-hnk,"Nov 30, 2025, 9:44 PM ET","Revenues atChina’s giant military firms fell last year as corruption purges slowed arms contracts and procurement, according to a study released on Monday by a leading conflict think tank.
The Chinese declines contrast with strong revenue growth globally for big arms and military-services companies, fueled by wars inUkraineandGaza, and global and regional tensions, the research by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute found.
“A host of corruption allegations in Chinese arms procurement led to major arms contracts being postponed or canceled in 2024,” said Nan Tian, director of SIPRI’s Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme.
“This deepens uncertainty around the status of China’s military modernisation efforts and when new capabilities will materialize.”
The People’s Liberation Army was one of the main targets of a broader corruption crackdown ordered by President Xi Jinping in 2012, reaching the upper levels of the military in 2023 when its Rocket Force was targeted.
Eight top generals were expelled from the ruling Communist Party on graft charges in October, including the country’s number two general,He Weidong. He had served under Xi on the Central Military Commission, China’s supreme military command organization.
Asian and Western diplomats say they are still trying to gauge the impact of the crackdown on China’s ongoing military rise and how far down it reaches through the command chain.
Revenues of China’s top military firms fell 10% last year, while those in Japan surged 40%, Germany 36% and US revenues rose 3.8%, SIPRI data shows.
Revenues of the world’s 100 largest arms firms rose 5.9% to a record $679 billion, the report said, while China’s fall was enough to make Asia-Oceania the only region to post a revenue decline among its top arms firms.
China’s weapons revenue fell despite three decades of rising defense budgets in Beijing’s growing strategic rivalry with the United States, Asia’s traditional military power, and tensions over Taiwan and the hotly disputed South China Sea.
The buildup is bearing fruit as China deploys the world’s largest naval and coast guard fleets – including a potentially advanced new aircraft carrier – a host of new hypersonic missiles, nuclear weapons and air and sea drones.
Revenue fell at AVIC, China’s largest arms maker, land-systems producer Norinco and aerospace and missile manufacturer CASC, all state-owned, according to the SIPRI research. Norinco experienced the steepest revenue decline, falling 31% to $14 billion.
Corruption-related personnel changes at the top of Norinco and CASC sparked government reviews and project delays, while deliveries of AVIC’s military aircraft slowed, the research found.
China’s defense ministry and the three companies did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment from Reuters.

The timeline of advanced systems for the People’s Liberation Army’s Rocket Force, which handles its growing arsenal of ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles, could be exposed, along with aerospace and cyber programs, said SIPRI researcher Xiao Liang.
This adds to uncertainties over the PLA’s target of getting key capabilities and war-fighting readiness in place for its 100th anniversary, Liang said. The PLA’s forerunner, Mao Zedong’s Red Army, was founded in 1927.
“However, in the medium and longer term, sustained investment in defense budgets and political commitment behind modernisation will continue, albeit with some program delays, higher costs and tighter control of procurement,” Liang said."
Planet Earth has never had so many billionaires,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/business/billionaires-worldwide-record-ubs-intl,"Dec 4, 2025, 11:48 AM ET","The number of billionaires worldwide – and their combined wealth – reached record highs this year, buoyed in particular by gains in tech stocks, Swiss bank UBS has found.
The world had 2,919 billionaires on April 4, when UBS completed that part of its research, the largest number since the bank started collecting the data in 1995.
“With tech shares and financial asset prices generally rising, despite volatility, billionaires’ total wealth reached a new high,” UBS wrote in its annualreporton billionaires published Thursday.
The MSCI World Index– which tracks more than 1,300 large and mid-sized public companies in developed markets – rose around 7% in the year to early April.
Billionaires’ combined wealth reached $15.8 trillion, an increase of 13% over 12 months, lifted by existing tech billionaires’ appreciating assets and by new billionaires across a range of sectors, the bank said. The number of billionaires jumped by 237 in the 12 months to April 4.
Tech billionaires’ assets grew by almost a quarter to $3 trillion, bolstered by the increasing value of their shares in artificial intelligence-linked companies such as Meta (META), Oracle (ORCL) and Nvidia (NVDA).
The six US tech billionaires whose wealth increased the most became $171 billion richer between them, UBS said, meaning that each became $28.5 billion richer on average.
“This surge is closely tied to their companies’ AI capabilities, from foundational chipmaking to AI-powered cloud infrastructure,” the bank wrote.
The total number of US billionaires rose to 924, accounting for almost a third of the global billionaire population. China now has 470 billionaires, second only to the United States.
UBS surveyed its billionaire clients between July and September 2025 and they identified tariffs, geopolitics and policy uncertainty as the top risks of 2026.
“What billionaires worry about most depends on where they live,” the bank wrote. For instance, 75% of billionaires in Asia-Pacific were concerned about tariffs, while 70% of American billionaires worried about higher inflation or a major geopolitical conflict."
Modelo and Corona are unexpected casualties of Trump’s immigration crackdown,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/business/modelo-corona-economy-immigration,"Dec 3, 2025, 5:30 AM ET","Constellation Brands, the US owner of Modelo Especial and Corona, bet big on Latino customers for growth. But that strategy is unraveling under the Trump administration’s mass deportation push.
Many Latino consumers, both legal and undocumented, are fearful of venturing out in public to stores, restaurants and bars due to theimmigration enforcement blitz, according to customer surveys, companies and market research. Big parties and celebrations where beer often flowed have been scaled back or canceled. Job cuts in industries with large immigrant workforces have squeezed finances, as hasa broader cost-of-living crunch.
Constellation’s sales have plunged, Modelo lost itstop-selling beer spotto Michelob Ultra, and its stock has dropped nearly 40% this year, making it one of the worst-performing companies on the S&P 500.
The company’s struggles illustrate how President Donald Trump’s immigration policies have ricocheted to unexpected corners of the economy and corporate America, upending years of wagers by some of America’s largest companies on the growing purchasing power of Latino consumers.
These pressures have hit Constellation harder than most companies because Latinos make up roughly half of Constellation’s beer customers – by far the largest concentration in the industry. California, home to the largest Latino population in America and a primary target of raids by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is also Constellation’s biggest market.
“Hispanic consumers are the single-most important consumer group for our beer business,” a Constellation executivesaidlast year. They have “been the foundation of how we’ve been able to drive growth.”
Constellation declined to comment for this article. The White House did not respond to request for comment.
In 2013, Constellation acquired the sole US rights to distribute Grupo Modelo, the Mexican beer giant that brews Corona, Modelo, Pacifico, Victoria and other beers.
The deal transformed Constellation from a mid-sized wine seller in upstate New York into one of the largest alcohol companies in the world. It was also a bet on the long-term potential of Latino consumers, whose population in the United States has nearly doubled over the past 25 years to68 million.
“Why we’re so confident about the future is our Hispanic consumers,” Constellation said in 2013 following the purchase.
The company launched new lines of Modelo based on popular drinks in Mexico; advertised in Spanish-language media; and saturated stores in heavily Hispanic markets in California, Texas and Florida. If an ad failed to test well with both Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers, it didn’t run, the companysaidin 2023.
These efforts made Constellation a rare bright spot in a slumping US beer industry as consumers shifted toward non-alcoholic drinks and cannabis. Drinking has declined among White adults, according toGalluppolling, but it has remained fairly steady among people of color.
“Constellation has been on this wonderful ascent because they had such a strong Latino business,” said Martin Stock, who worked on Constellation’s beer brands for six years as CEO of advertising agency Cavalry. “They had brands that had a leg in Latino culture and they then broadened them out.”
Modeloovertook Bud Lightas the top-selling beer in America in 2023, and Corona became the fifth-largest beer by sales.
“The beer business in general is having a brutal time,” Stock said. “Constellation was an exception. They ran counter to the beer trends up until about 10 months ago.”
Bud Light loses its title as America’s top-selling beer
The Trump administration’s sweeping deportation push hasrattledcompanies of all sizes, particularly in immigrant corridors in Los Angeles; Chicago; Charlotte, North Carolina; and other major cities.
Nearly half of US small business owners say that increased immigration enforcement has had a negative impact on their business, according to apollreleased in November by Small Business Majority, an advocacy group. In Texas, for example, restaurant owners say customer traffic has dropped and employees have quit, according to asurveylast month from the Texas Restaurant Association, a trade group.
Other corporate giants are also hurting. Burlington, Wingstop, Colgate-Palmolive, PepsiCo and others have all reported sales declines at stores and restaurants in heavily Latino neighborhoods.
Constellation warned investors in its annual securities filing in April that changes in immigration laws and enforcement “impacting consumers, particularly Hispanic consumers,” are a risk to its business.
Its beer shipments to US retailers plunged 8.7% last quarter and are expected to decline by up to 4% in its 2026 fiscal year.
Latino customers have changed their shopping habits in ways that are “anti-our business,” CEO Bill Newlands said in October.
“The Hispanic consumer is very concerned at the moment,” he said. “The results that (we) are seeing in high Hispanic zip code areas is significantly worse” than in other markets.
Seventy-eight percent of Hispanic adults say economic conditions today are fair or poor, according to a Pewpollreleased in November. Hispanic consumers are more likely than other Americans to rate their current economic situation negatively, Pew found.
The big question for Constellation is if the pullback by Latino customers is fleeting – or if it represents a long-term threat to the company.
Some analysts say Constellation can mitigate the downturn because it has broadened the market for Mexican beers to non-Hispanic consumers. They expect Constellation to both expand distribution and marketing in areas with lower Latino populations and to roll out smaller, cheaper pack sizes to draw economically strapped shoppers.
But Constellation’s recovery hinges in large part on whether the Trump administration ramps up deportations, sending consumers further into hiding and shrinking the market.
The volatility is “unprecedented,” Newlands said. “We’re cautiously – and I would stress that word again – cautiously optimistic that we’ve hit the bottom here.”"
Analysis: Trump’s team tried to walk back these false claims. He won’t let them,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/grocery-prices-fbi-january-6-trump,"Nov 17, 2025, 4:36 PM ET","The pattern has repeated itself for years.
It happened twice in the last 24 hours, once on grocery prices and once on the deployment of FBI agents during the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
﻿Step 1:Trump makes a false claim: Trump hasrepeatedlyclaimedthis fall that grocery prices are “down” or “way down” during his second presidency.
CNN and others havepointed outthatthis is not true. As of September, grocery prices were up about 1.4% since January, the month Trump returned to office, and up about 2.7% since September 2024.
Step 2:Trump’s team tries a walk-back: Kevin Hassett, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, initially echoed Trump’s false assertion,declaringon CBS on November 9 that “grocery prices are actually down significantly under Trump.” But Hassett pivoted to more factual spin the next day – correctlytellingCNN’s Kaitlan Collins that “not everything” is up in grocery stores, that “egg prices are down,” and that the average overall monthly inflation rate under Trump has been lower than it was under President Joe Biden.
When Collins emphasized that Trump’s claim was about grocery prices rather than overall inflation, Hassett claimed: “Inflation is down, is what he means.”
The broader White House tried something similar in apress release on Friday. It repeated Hassett’s point about a decline in average monthly inflation. And instead of using Trump’s categorical claim that grocery prices are down since the end of the Biden administration, the press release said the prices of grocery staples “are starting to see declines” – then listed the smattering of particular products whose prices have fallen during this Trump presidency, including eggs, ham, butter and ice cream.
The press release didn’t acknowledge thatfar more products have gotten more expensive, but this was at least fact-based political spin rather than outright dishonesty.
Step 3:Trump repeats the original false claim: Trumpspoketo reporters on Sunday. He reprised his outright dishonesty.
“From an economic standpoint, our prices are coming down very substantially on groceries and things. They’re already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration,” he said.
Again, that is not true. And contrary to what Hassett claimed about what Trump supposedly “means,” Trump made clear that he means what he says – that overall grocery prices are lower now than they were under Biden – even though that isn’t accurate.
Step 1:Trump makes a false claim: Trump falselyclaimedon social media in late September that former FBI director Christopher Wray, a Trump appointee the president later turned against, had been caught lying about the activities of FBI agents on January 6, 2021.
Trump wrote: “It was just revealed that the FBI had secretly placed, against all Rules, Regulations, Protocols, and Standards, 274 FBI Agents into the Crowd just prior to, and during, the January 6th Hoax. This is different from what Director Christopher Wray stated, over and over again! That’s right, as it now turns out, FBI Agents were at, and in, the January 6th Protest, probably acting as Agitators and Insurrectionists, but certainly not as ‘Law Enforcement Officials.’”
That isn’t true.
Two days prior to Trump’s social media post, a right-wing website hadpublisheda document that said 274 FBI agents had been deployed on January 6. But the document, whose authenticity CNN hasn’t verified,made clearthat these agents wereresponding tothe riot and other incidents that day (like the pipe bombs found near Republican and Democratic offices), not instigating or perpetrating the riot. And the inspector general for the Justice Departmentfound last yearthat the FBI had no undercover agents at all at the Capitol on January 6, though 26 of its paid informants were in Washington that day.
Step 2:Trump’s team tries a walk-back: Kash Patel, the Trump-appointed director of the FBI, tried to correct the record about the activities of the 274 agents on January 6. HetoldFox News on the day of Trump’s post: “Agents were sent into a crowd control mission after the riot was declared by Metro Police – something that goes against FBI standards.” Patelreiteratedon the social media platform X, “274 FBI agents were thrown into crowd control on Jan 6 against FBI standards.”
Even with the “against FBI standards” claim, Patel’s statementsrepresented a clear repudiationof the president’s conspiracy theory.
Step 3:Trump repeats the original false claim: Nearly two months later, Trump revived the conspiracy theory about the 274 agents on Monday morning.
The president re-posted the September post in which he wrongly described the actions of the agents. And in a second Monday post, Trump promoted someone else’s call for Wray to be indicted and imprisoned – and hewrote, baselessly, “Wray lied!!!”"
Trump says he’s decided on his pick for Fed chair. Here’s who’s who on the short list,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/28/business/fed-chair-pick-trump-short-list-vis,"Oct 28, 2025, 7:43 AM ET","President Donald Trump said he has decided who will become the most powerful figure in the US economy.
The president on Sunday said he made up his mind and will be making an announcement. The looming nomination caps a months-long search process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who provided Trump with a short list of five people.
Few people wield as much influence over financial markets and the global economy as the head of the US central bank. A few words from the Fed chair can move markets and shift billions of dollars. It’s a role so consequential that Trump has even mused about taking it for himself.
Trump has made no secret of his distaste for Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May. Trump has, at various points, said he would fire Powell or force him to resign; berated him for not lowering interest rates; and called on the Fed’s Board of Governors to oust him. Now, finally, Trump has an opportunity to reshape the central bank in his own image — and he is seizing it.
If Trump makes his announcement by the end of the year, it would be the earliest any president has announced a Fed chair nominee before the incumbent steps down.
Bessent said last week that there is a “very good chance” Trump will announce his pick before Christmas.
Whoever Trump picks will be subject to confirmation by the Republican-controlled Senate, and will lead the central bank as it juggles competing priorities after the administration’s sweeping economic policies raised the risk of higher inflation and weaker economic growth. Fed policymakers arecurrently dividedon how Trump’s policies are affecting the economy.
Here’s who’s who on the administration’s short list for the top job at the Fed."
Trump is trying to make ‘affordability’ his issue. Good luck with that.,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/affordability-trump-gop-analysis,"Nov 7, 2025, 11:56 AM ET","President Donald Trumpis nothing if not gifted at crafting politically advantageous alternate realities. Throughrepetition, force of will and shamelessness, he’s convinced tens of millions of Americans ofa host of dubious or outright-false claims– most notably that the 2020 election he lost was somehow “stolen.”
But Trump’s latest effort to rewrite reality is brazen and puzzling even by his standards.
As inflation has proven stubborn, and even ticked up, and as energy andgrocery prices have continued to rise, Trump has set about trying to convince people that this isn’t the case at all.
“I will say this: If you look at affordability, which they campaigned on, they lied,” Trump told reporters on Friday, referring to Democrats’ success in Tuesday’s election.
“Because they talked about, ‘Oh, prices are up.’ No, no. Prices are down under the Trump administration. And they’re down substantially.”
He’s arguing that the rising costs people can see and feel are actually down. And now he’s trying to make “affordability” his calling card.
Good luck with that.
Polls have made clear Americans not only overwhelmingly understand prices are rising, but they strongly link this to Trump’s policies.
What’s more, the president has allowed a particularly troublesome perception to fester: that he’s been asleep at the wheel.
It’s difficult to see how pretending that inflation doesn’t exist and that his administration has done a great job on this issue is going to change that. If anything, it could exacerbate a perception that the administration is divorced from reality.
Trump has responded to Republicans’ poor 2025 election results by suddenly keying like a laser on “affordability.” He might not have much regard for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s democratic socialist policies, but he seems happy to rip a page out of Mamdani’s political playbook.
“Why did Zohran Mamdani do so well last night? He relentlessly focused on affordability,” top White House political adviser James Blairtold Politicoon Wednesday.
Trump’s MAGA ally Vivek Ramaswamy, who is running for Ohio governor, cut a video on election night urging Republicans to set aside their focus on culture warsin favor of an affordability focus.
Fact check: Trump falsely claims it’s only beef, but dozens of groceries have gotten more expensive this year
Trump has posted on social media and spoken repeatedly about affordability in the last few days, claiming on Friday that Democrats’ message on the topic was a “con job” and that Republicans need to do a better job talking about his economic successes.
“The only problem is the Republicans don’t talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads, because we have great numbers,” he said Thursday, claiming there’s “virtually no inflation.”
Trump has also repeatedly pointed to Walmart’s annual Thanksgiving grocery list costing under $40 this year compared to about $55 last year.
The talking point isa complete non sequitur, as CNN’s Daniel Dale writes. It’s not apples-to-apples because this year’s list has fewer items. And it’s clear that grocery prices writ large are up. In fact, average prices in Septemberwere up 1.4% compared to Januaryand up about 3% since last year, according to a recent Consumer Price Index study. They also just saw theirlargest one-month year-over-year increase (0.6%) in three yearsthis summer.
When pressed on the apples-to-oranges comparison of the Walmart Thanksgiving list on Friday, he dismissed the question as “fake news.”
But it’s not just that prices are up; it’s also that people recognize that, despite Trump’s claims.
A CBS News-YouGov poll last week showed just7% of Americans said prices have been going downrecently. Another 62% said they’re going up.
A Washington Post-ABC News poll, meanwhile, showsfewer than 10% of Americans say they’re paying less for groceries and utilitiescompared to a year ago. Conversely, 71% said they’re paying more for groceries, and 59% said they’re paying more for utilities.
And more than that, people draw a direct line from these price increases and economic pains to Trump.
All of which brings us to perhaps the one economic number that I keep coming back to on this topic.
CBS has asked repeatedly during Trump’s second term whether he was focused enough on lowering prices.
The percentage who said he’s focused “not enough” on this has risen from 64% in March to 70% in July to 75% in October.
That’s three-quarters of Americans who haven’t seen Trump doing enough on this topic. Even a clear majority of Republicans – 57% – say Trump has neglected the issue.
These perceptions are baked-in now, in large part because Trumphasneglected the issue, at least until he decided to start saying “affordability” a lot in recent days.
If anything, he’s given people a shorthand to tie him to this persistent inflation. That’s in part because he decided to make tariffs, which are often inflationary, his signature economic policy. And he decided to implement them unilaterally, making it clear exactly who is responsible for them. He voluntarily took near-complete ownership of the economy, and now he’s trying to pretend things have gone better than they have.
Trump might be able to convince some people that what they see with their own eyes at the grocery stores or on their electric bills isn’t real. Maybe he’ll get some MAGA Republicans to misremember prices being higher a year ago.
But when it comes to convincing the rest of the population they’re better off now, it’s really hard to see that working.
Trump’s alternate realities often resonate because Americans live in information silos where his claims aren’t fact-checked. That can work well when it comes to complex subjects like voter fraud.
But prices are things people can fact-check with their own eyes. They’re facts that are quite literally in people’s faces on a daily basis.
And ultimately, what Trump risks is instead convincing people that he’s out of touch with their economic realities.

UK’s unpopular government delivers tax-raising budget after leak that outlined its main plans,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/26/economy/uk-budget-leak-intl,"Nov 26, 2025, 11:10 AM ET","Britain’s unpopular center-left Labour government sought to seize the political narrative Wednesday with a tax-raising budget that it hopes will boost economic growth, reduce child poverty and ease cost-of-living pressures.
But the chaos that has engulfed the government during weeks of mixed messaging and political infighting continued up to the final moment. The entire contents of the budget were leaked half an hour before Treasury chief Rachel Reeves delivered the budget statement in the House of Commons.
The government was elected in a landslide victory in July 2024 on a promise not to raise taxes on income for working people, and Reeves acknowledged that some of the budget’s £26 billion ($34 billion) in tax hikes broke the spirit of that pledge and would face criticism.
But, she said, “I have yet to see a credible or a fairer alternative plan for working people.
“These are my choices – the right choices for a fairer, a stronger, and a more secure Britain,” she said.
The biggest change in terms of money raised is freezing the thresholds at which earners pay Britain’s different tax levels for a further three years from 2028, meaning as wages rise, more people fall into higher tax brackets.
Other measures included a mansion tax, changes to the capital gains tax regime, higher gambling taxes, a new levy on electric car use and a cut to tax-free provisions for private pensions.
Reeves also abolished a much-hated cap on benefits paid out to families with more than two children. She also announced measures to ease the financial pressure on households, by freezing rail fares and cutting levies on household energy bills.
Britain is one of the world’s richest countries. So why do a third of its children live in poverty?
Overall, the budget was strikingly similar to Reeves’ first budget a little more than a year ago, even though she insisted at the time that it would be the one and only big tax-raising budget in this parliamentary term, due to run to 2029.
Unfortunately for Reeves, the UK economy, the world’s sixth-largest, isn’t doing as well as she hoped, with many critics blaming her decision last year to slap taxes on business. Though there were signs the economy was improving in the first half of the year, when it was the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, it has faltered again.
Britain’s public finances, like those of other nations, have been squeezed in recent years by the costs of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The United Kingdom bears the extra burden of Brexit, which has knocked billions off the economy since the country left the European Union in 2020.
Meanwhile, Reeves has a bunch of spending commitments aimed at easing the cost of living as inflation remains stubbornly high, including making up for a series of about-faces on planned welfare cuts.
The budget followed weeks of messy mixed messaging and political acrimony that continued into the minutes before Reeves stood in the House of Commons.
On November 4, Reeves made a speech to prepare the public and markets for a hike in income tax rates, which would break a key election promise. After an outcry among Labour lawmakers, and a better-than-expected update on public finances, she reversed course, opting for a smorgasbord of smaller revenue-raising measures.
Then, the entire fiscal forecast from the independent watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), including details of the budget’s main measures, was published online half an hour before Reeves’ statement.
Reeves said the early release was “deeply disappointing and a serious error” by the budget watchdog.
The OBR blamed a “technical error” for the leak, saying it went “live on our website too early this morning.” It said it will report to all relevant authorities, including the Treasury, as to what happened.
The budget is a high-stakes moment for Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is facing mounting concern from Labour lawmakers over his dire poll ratings. Opinion polls consistently put Labour well behind the hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.
The next election doesn’t have to be held until 2029, and the government continues to hope that its economic measures will spur higher growth and ease financial pressures.
But speculation is swirling about a potential challenge to Starmer’s leadership from within his party, and analysts say a misfiring budget could add to the sense of crisis within the government."
One of Trump’s most consequential decisions just got more complicated,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/08/economy/trump-fed-chair-decision-complexities,"Dec 8, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump last week gave his strongest hint yet that he’s picked a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Investors have concerns.
After months of speculation over the names of the dozen or so candidates, Trump finally said last weekhe knows who he will nominateto be the most powerful figure in the US economy. Just days later during a Cabinet meeting, Trump singled out National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett as “a potential Fed chair,” adding, “Are we allowed to say that?”
The 10-year Treasury yield rose by 11 basis points after a report from Bloomberg on November 25 said Hassett wasthe “frontrunner” to head the central bank. And bond investors told the Treasury Department earlier last month that they feared Hassett would push to lower borrowing costs aggressively to appease Trump, according tothe Financial Times, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter.
That sentiment was reflected in one-on-one conversations the department had with “executives at major Wall Street banks, asset management giants and other big players in the US debt market,” according to the report.
The unease comes at a time when policymakersare divided on how to proceed with interest rates. They fret that Hassett, a long-time Trump ally, would care more about following the president’s demands than preserving the Fed’s independence to set interest rates without political interference — even though the Fed chair has only one vote.
Their concerns matter because markets could throw a tantrum and force Trump to withdraw his nomination of Hassett, in an embarrassing U-turn.
“Markets really act as a sanity check for policy and other major decisions,” said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global investment strategist at Edward Jones.
Trump’s pick for Fed chair was already complicated because of Fed rules on who can serve as chair. Reshuffling his top economic advisers would add another layer of complexity. And Fed Governor Lisa Cook’s future on the Board is also uncertain asthe courts determine whether Trump can fire her.
“The market is already trying to figure out how dovish or hawkish the next Fed chair may be,” said Tom Porcelli, Wells Fargo’s chief economist. “But you don’t really know how someone will behave in a role once they’re actually sitting in that seat.”
As an independently funded agency, the Fed’s ability to make rate decisions free of politics is a major reason why investors believe in the US economy’s soundness. Politicians around the world often want to get cheap money flowing to help earn them votes. But that risks overheating economies and boosting inflation — long-term risks many politicians might ignore to focus on short-term elections.
If investors lose that faith in the Fed, they might demand a higher return to lend the country money through US Treasuries or other instruments. The irony is that those higher bond yields would likely push up long-term interest rates anyway.
But the structure of the Fed’s rate-setting committee could helpguard against political influence: The Fed chair is only one voter among 12 and cannot unilaterally veto what the majority decides.
“A range of views and policy approaches are represented around the table, and then everyone gets one vote,” said Bill English, a former adviser to the Fed’s Board of Governors.
“There’s a committee for a reason, and if the committee disagrees with the chair, then it’s possible that the chair loses a vote, which has never happened in the past,” he said.
The Fed chair isn’t the only economic position in play right now. There’s a whole web of Trump advisers who might be shuffling positions or even serving in simultaneously overlapping roles.
If Trump picks Hassett to lead America’s central bank, the president will have to find someone else to lead the NEC, which orchestrates White House economic policy.
Trump’s advisers have floated the possibility of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent leading the NEC while remaining as Treasury secretary,according to Bloomberg.Last week, Trump reiterated that he would gladly pick Bessent as Fed chair, though the Treasury secretary has repeatedly said he would rather keep his current role.
Trump also has to consider the Council of Economic Advisers. The chair of the CEA is Stephen Miran — who is now on temporary leave so he can serve out a term as a Fed governor in an unprecedented arrangement.Since arriving at the Fed in September, Miranhas advocated for large rate cuts, dissenting from the majority’s decision to lower rates by a quarter point at both the September and October meetings.
Miran’s term on the Fed expires at the end of January, butin response to questionsposed by senators during his confirmation process, Miran said that he won’t commit to resigning until a successor has been nominated and confirmed.
According to Fed rules, the chair can be chosen only from among Fed governors, and there is currently no vacancy on the Board. Powell’s leadership term ends in May, but he is serving a concurrent term as a governor that stretches to 2028. Powell hasn’t shared whether or not he plans to remain on the Board after his term as chair ends. Fed chairs typically step down altogether once theirfour-year term concludes, if they’re not re-appointed.
Trump could also swap Hassett for Miran, then elevate him to chair in May; or Trump could wait and hope that Powell announces he’s stepping down next year and have both Miran and Hassett at the Fed. In the latter scenario, Trump would then (theoretically) have to select replacements to lead the NEC and CEA.
Separately, Governor Lisa Cook’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s attempt to fire her over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud can also affect the make-up of the Fed’s powerful Board.
Trump in August said he fired Cook, the first time in the Fed’s century-plus history that a president has attempted to remove a sitting governor. Cook responded in the courts, andthe Supreme Court is scheduledto decide the case next year.
If Cook loses her case and is replaced, Trump would have effectively shaped the majority of the Board at a time when the central bank’s political independence is a flashpoint.
“There’s concern about a politicization of the Fed resulting in an undesirably high level of inflation over time,” English said. “The market could ultimately revolt if a new chair comes in and the committee, for whatever reason, goes along with lowering rates more than they need to be lowered.”"
Home Depot’s business is stuck. That’s a bad sign for the economy,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/home-depot-economy,"Nov 18, 2025, 6:44 AM ET","The housing market is frozen, and consumers arenervousabout the economy. That’s a bad recipe for Home Depot.
The bellwether for US consumers and the housing market said Tuesday that its sales at US stores open for at least one year rose only 0.2% last quarter. It also cut its profit forecast for the year.
Home Depot attributed the slowdown to consumers cutting back on remodeling projects and big home upgrades. Mortgage rates have been stuck between 6% and 7% in recent years, leading fewer people to buy and sell their homes.
“We believe that consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand,” Home Depot CEO Ted Decker said in a statement.
The company also said that fewer major storms and extreme weather events last quarter led to weaker customer demand for roofing materials, backup power generators and plywood.
Home Depot’s (HD) stock slipped 3% during pre-market trading Tuesday. Shares have dropped roughly 8% this year.
The company has also been grappling with President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported goods. Nearly half of Home Depot’s inventory comes from suppliers outside the United States.
In August, finance chief Richard McPhail said Home Depot would have to raise some prices as a result of the Trump administration’s taxes on imports.
“For some imported goods, tariff rates are significantly higher today than they were at this time last quarter,” he said in an interview with theWall Street Journal. “So as you would expect, there will be modest price movement in some categories, but it won’t be broad based.”"
"At some food banks, surging demand means a struggle to feed families",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/27/business/thanksgiving-food-banks-strained,"Nov 27, 2025, 7:01 AM ET","In Polk County, Iowa, the Urbandale Food Pantry started giving out turkeys and Thanksgiving sides weeks ago. Demand was so high, with over 2,000 families visiting so far this month, that the pantry ran through its allotment of Thanksgiving staples.
Fortunately, additional funding, including donations from the community,meant the pantry could continue to supply Thanksgiving items.
But the high demand at Urbandale is emblematic of what many food pantries and organizations are seeing this year: increased need, as high prices squeeze Americans’ wallets and many families are still recovering from the interruption in SNAP benefits because of the government shutdown.
Food banks face a ‘perfect storm’ of surging demand as shutdown drags on
“This month has been unlike anything we’ve seen,” Patty Sneddon-Kisting, the pantry’s CEO and only full-time employee, told CNN.
Food prices have been a source of stress for many Americans this holiday season. Grocery pricesgained 1.4%between January and September, and US consumer prices haverisen 1.7%on average this year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But that relatively low inflation builds on years of much higher rates, includinga multi-decade highof 9.1% annual inflation after the pandemic. The accumulated price increases have left many Americans struggling to keep up.
And when the government shut down for six weeks earlier this year, the pause in full SNAP benefits drove many Americans even closer to the edge. Google searches for “food banks near me” hit a new high over that time.
Meanwhile, wage growth for many workers has fallenbehindincreases for those at the top of the economy. In contrast to stock market gains and surging home prices for wealthier Americans, the number of households receiving SNAP benefits hasgrownsince 2023, according to Pew Research Center.
“When food prices are increasing and their monthly income isn’t really increasing to match it, it puts a lot of pressure on household budgets,” Michael Flood, executive director of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, told CNN.
Flood said his food bank hasn’t been able to keep up with demand this Thanksgiving season. However, support from volunteers has enabled LA Regional Food Bank to expand its distribution sites, with total food distribution up 24% compared to the Thanksgiving period last year, according to Flood.
Over the past month, the group of food pantries that comprise Share Food Program in Philadelphia saw a 12-fold increase in new registrants looking for food support, said George Matysik, the executive director. He added that emergency funding from the state and community donations enabled the program to continue buying food.
“These last few months have been the most challenging in the history of our organization,” he said.
At least one resource, though, is abundant: In a busier-than-usual holiday season, the volunteers who power these food banks are stepping up their efforts to help their friends and neighbors, pantries told CNN.
“We typically seem to have more than enough people out volunteering,” said Mary Connors, a retiree who has volunteered with the LA Regional Food Bank for six years. “Everybody’s excited to give back.”"
White House weighs stepped up domestic travel and speeches to improve Trump’s standing on the economy,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/politics/trump-economy-white-house-strategy,"Nov 12, 2025, 4:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump’sadvisers have had conversations about him traveling the country to give economy-focused speeches as they privately weigh a number of strategies to improve his standing on the issue, administration officials told CNN.
Trump’s advisers acknowledge that they have an affordability problem that the president hasbristled at in public: Americans’ outlook on the economy is dour, and the administration’s efforts to ease their financial anxieties aren’t resonating.
“You can’t convince people that their experience, what they’re feeling at home, isn’t reality,” one of the officials said.
White House officials have advised the president not to brush away or outright dismiss that Americans are feeling squeezed byrising prices, they said. They have been actively putting “policy time” — as one of the officials characterized it — on Trump’s schedule with the goal of accelerating the administration’s efforts to tackle inflation.
While Trump has talked extensively about affordability in recent days, he has often downplayed the strain Americans are feeling, suggesting in a Fox News interview on Monday that polls capturing Americans’ economic anxiety are “fake.”
One of the strategies being discussed in the West Wing is for Trump to turn much of his attention to his domestic agenda. That includes ramping up his domestic travel, the officials said, and pulling back on his international trips. As the holidays draw near, there’s also a push to coordinate new messaging on what the administration is doing to help lower costs.
Two key factors last week — Democratic victories in Tuesday’s elections and the mounting pain of the record-long government shutdown — initially set off alarm bells, not only in the White House but in the Oval Office directly, about the magnitude of the issue, the officials said.
The discussions also come as Trump has been criticized, including by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of focusing more on his foreign policy and less on domestic concerns, though the president dismissed that notion on Monday.
“I have to view the presidency as a worldwide situation, not locally,” Trump said, responding to the criticism thathe was too busy meeting with foreign leaders. “But with all of that, I passed a great big beautiful bill, which is the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.”
The president, meanwhile, has been personally frustrated with Americans’ perception of his administration’s handling of the economy and the media’s coverage of it.
“The president gets it. He knows this is an issue,” a senior White House official said. “But he’s frustrated he’s not getting credit for what he’s doing,” pointing to energy deregulations and the extension of his 2017 tax cuts.
Trumpacknowledgedthat frustration last week, just hours after Democrats walked away with major wins in New Jersey, Virginia, New York City and California.
“I tell Republicans, you want to win elections, you got to talk about these facts,” he told a financial conference in Miami, concluding that his party has been too quiet about the economic accomplishments of his term so far. “You know, it’s really easy to win elections when you talk about the facts.”
Earlier in the day, Trump castigated Senate Republicans, arguing they weregetting “killed” politicallyby the government shutdown, which public polling showed Americans blaming more on the GOP and Trump than on Democrats.
It appears the shutdown could be over by week’s end, but officials argue that it has contributed to burgeoning concerns about the cost of living in the US. (The shutdown also exposed anotherpotential political liabilityfor the GOP in the form of rising health care premiums, which the party will be forced to grapple with after this week’s votes to reopen the government.)
Trump’s public comments on the economy have at times been reminiscent of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, who was widely seen as out of touch for initially downplaying the threat of inflation.
Pressed during Monday’s Fox News interview about why Americans say they’re down on the economy if he’s accomplished as much as he says he has to lower prices, Trump questioned the premise.
“I don’t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake,” Trump said. “We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.” He used the opportunity to point to the revenue being generated from his tariff policies. (In aCNN pollreleased last week, 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” That number topped out at 58% under Biden in CNN polling.)
Fact check: Trump’s lying spree about inflation
Some of the president’s defensive messaging has come from what he’s being told by his advisers, who have argued that his financial policies are working but need time to settle in, two of the officials said. They’ve also cautioned that while his tariffs have caused a temporary ripple in the economy, those hurdles will be smoothed out by the 2026 midterms.
“President Trump inherited the worst affordability crisis in modern American history, and in less than ten months, he stopped inflation in its tracks,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement. “The President’s pro-growth policies of deregulation and energy independence are bringing down gas prices, food prices, and inflation — and Americans will continue to benefit. Trust in Trump — he created the greatest economy in his first term and he is doing it again in his second term.”
Yet despite Trump’s grandiose claims about ushering in the best economy in history and knocking Democrats’ affordability message as a “con job,” he’s also taken steps in recent days to try to make his mark on the issue. He’s floated$2,000 tariff rebate checksto lower- and middle-income Americans, gone after meatpacking companies he’s accused of jacking up prices, and even raised the idea of a 50-year mortgage (a proposal that stemmed from Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte and one that many White House officials are not on board with).
All of those moves appear to be an indication of how the president is seeing the affordability issue resonate, even as he attempts to brush it off in another breath.
And while some in the White House see the new fixation on affordability as an overreaction to last week’s elections and shutdown anxiety, administration officials also want to avoid Biden’s mistakes, which means taking Americans’ perceptions about the economy seriously — and doing something about it.
With critical midterms that will shape the rest of Trump’s term now less than a year away, they don’t see time to waste."

Trump administration nears deals with pharmaceutical companies to offer obesity drugs for $149 a month,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/obesity-drugs-trump-pharmaceutical-companies,"Nov 4, 2025, 5:44 PM ET","The Trump administration is nearing deals with drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to offer some of their obesity drugs to consumers for as low as $149 per month, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.
The agreements would also clear the way for Medicare to cover the drugs for certain beneficiaries — a move that could broaden the market for medications like Wegovy, Zepbound and Mounjaro that have already proven widely popular despite their steep prices. The list price of the drugs range from roughly $1,000 to $1,350, though the price consumers pay depends on their insurance and on discounts.
President Donald Trump is expected to announce the deals as soon as Thursday, though the people familiar with the negotiations cautioned that they are not finalized and that officials are still working through key policy details.
In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that “discussion about deals that have not been officially announced by the administration should be regarded as speculation.” Press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday declined to confirm the planned announcement, but said a deal that cuts the cost of the obesity drugs was “something that the administration has been engaged and looking into.”
The negotiations over Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk’s obesity drugs represent perhaps the highest-profile element of a broader White House push to cut drug prices by striking individual deals with pharmaceutical manufacturers.
The “Most Favored Nation” initiative has so far resulted in agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and other companies to sell certain products directly to consumers at a reduced price — often in exchange for relief from the threat of targeted tariffs.Eli LillyandNovo Nordiskalready provide their weight loss drugs at a discount directly to consumers who pay cash.
Yet Trump has fixated in particular on striking a deal for GLP-1 medications that have exploded in popularity in recent years for helping with weight loss and a range of chronic conditions. The president has referred to them in both public and private as the “fat-loss drug.”
“We’re going to be paying, instead of $1,300, you’ll be paying about $150,” Trump said of the GLP-1 drugs during a mid-October event highlighting a separate drug price deal, prompting US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief Mehmet Oz to jump in and emphasize that the negotiations were still ongoing.
Endpoints News firstreportedthat deals were approaching the finish line.
It’s unclear exactly which of the companies’ drugs will be sold for $149 and whether there will be restrictions on consumers’ access to them. The deals are related to a pilot program that CMS is in the final stages of developing aimed at capping the cost of the obesity drugs for some Medicare beneficiaries, one of the people familiar with the negotiations said.
“We have been in dialogue with President Trump’s administration for a long time now, and our aim is exactly the same: provide affordable access to as many people as possible,” said Mike Doustdar, Novo Nordisk’s chief executive, in an interview with CNN Wednesday morning after the company reported quarterly earnings. “Hopefully we’ll be able to solve the solution where there is better access than today.”
Doustdar noted the negotiations are ongoing, and didn’t comment on any specific details. He said the company’scash-payoption for Ozempic and Wegovy, at $499 a month for patients outside of insurance, is “the channel that’s right now growing the most.” Lilly also offers cash-payoptionsfor its weight-loss drug Zepbound that start at $349 a month.
Weight-loss drugs, Doustdar added, increasingly resemble a consumer market – one more driven by new product updates that he compared to iPhones, rather than a more traditional pharmaceutical market like for insulin, where patients find a version that works for them and usually go through insurance.
“Within obesity care, we have seen that patients – customers – get excited about that next best thing,” Doustdar said.
The expected deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk follow a yearslong debate on both sides of the aisle over whether Medicare and Medicaid should cover the pricey drugs. The Biden administration last year officially proposed expanding coverage of them, though the plan was not finalized before Trump took office. The Trump administration said in April that it washaltingthe proposal but left the door open to consider future policy options for covering the drugs.
Also, notably, Ozempic and Wegovy were selected in January for second round ofMedicare drug price negotiations, which is expected to result in savings for the program and, possibly, for enrollees depending on their drug coverage.
Trump’s current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., vehemently opposed efforts to make the medications more accessible, telling Fox Newsahead of last November’s electionthat Novo Nordisk — which makes Ozempic — was “counting on selling it to Americans because we are so stupid and so addicted to drugs.” But since joining the administration, he has struck a far more accommodating tone, expressing openness to patients using them if prior efforts to improve their health have failed.

Trump heads to Pennsylvania as GOP tries to sell its own affordability message,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/politics/pennsylvania-trump-speech-prices-economy,"Dec 9, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","President Donald Trumpwill take his economic message on the road Tuesday to a swing district in eastern Pennsylvania, the first of many planned domestic trips the White House is organizing on an issue it believes will be the key decider in next year’s midterms.
“Affordability” has become a buzzword among leaders in both parties in recent months, with each side trying to win the messaging war and deflect blame over the financial strain felt by millions of Americans.
For Trump, who promised a new age of economic prosperity in his campaign, it’s a test of his ability to deliver, as GOP lawmakers prepare for an uphill battle defending their House and Senate majorities.
“Everybody gets it at the White House,” said one Trump adviser. “We’ve got a lot of work to go, and it’s frustrating for the president, but it’s what we’ve got to deal with.”
Yet more than a year after his victory, polls show that a majority of Americans feel Trump has not yet made good on that promise — and he faces the prospect of an electoral wipeout in next year’s midterms if he fails to quickly regain his footing on the economy.And so far, the president has struggled to stay on message when it comes to the economy and has even dismissed Americans’ economic pain, repeatedly referring to affordability as a “Democratic hoax” in the wake of theparty’s electoral successesin off-year elections last month.
A recent Gallup poll found that 40% of Americans rated economic conditions as poor in November, up from 37% in October.
AFox News national surveyfrom November found 76% of voters view the economy negatively. And perhaps most alarming for Trump and his aides, Republicans have steadily lost their long-held advantage over Democrats on economic issues, with the administration bleeding support from cost-concerned voters on both sides of the aisle.
“Large numbers, overall and among Republicans, say their costs for groceries, utilities, healthcare and housing have gone up this year,” Fox News said of the results.
A key question hanging over Tuesday’s event — and the White House’s economic strategy — is how Trump himself chooses to approach the cost-of-living issue during his speech at the Mount Airy Casino Resort: Will he continue to insist on painting the economy as being stronger than ever thanks to his leadership, or will he concede to his aides’ wishes and acknowledge there is work to be done to help ease Americans’ concerns?
Alarm bells began going off on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue after Democrats walked away with major victories in New Jersey, Virginia and California last month, with high prices and cost-of-living concerns ranking as a top issue for voters, multiple White House and Trump administration officials told CNN.
Since then, Trump has been focused on highlighting his economic policies and has called on members of his party to do the same, though he personally views the issue as a perception problem, the officials said.
“He feels this is a communication issue,” said one administration official. “He wants Republicans to step it up in talking about all the good work being done to improve the economy.”
Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, one of a handful of Republicans who’s defending a district Trump lost in 2024, said he agrees with the president that affordability “istheissue.”
“That trumps everything else,” he told CNN’s Manu Rajuin a recent interview, adding that he doesn’t think his party has been focusing enough on the topic.
However, Fitzpatrick also said he disagrees with the president’s rhetoric referring to affordability as “a Democratic scam.”
“I don’t believe that to be true at all. And we know it’s real,” he said. “I — believe me — I hear it every day back home. It’s real.”
Trump has bristled at the suggestion there are fundamental flaws in the economy, which he frequently boasts he rescued from Biden-era policies, flashing irritation in particular at Democrats’ efforts to seize on affordability issues as a central element of their midterm strategy.
In public and private, Trump has instead cast blame on former President Joe Biden, arguing he inherited a plagued economy and that it takes time for his own policies to settle in. He’s resisted acknowledging voters’ cost-of-living concerns as legitimate, deriding affordability worries as a “hoax” and “con job” ginned up solely to hurt him politically.
In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai characterized the cost-of-living concerns as “Joe Biden’s inflation and affordability crisis,” arguing that Trump views improving the economy as a top priority.
“Much work remains, but President Trump is highlighting the meaningful progress that his Administration has made and will continue to make,” he said.
But as Trump approaches the one-year mark of his second term, simply blaming Biden has begun to lose its effectiveness with the public. And even as Trump publicly downplays Americans’ financial struggles under his tenure, his top advisers acknowledge the GOP has a problem. CNN previously reported that in recent weeks, White House officials have advised the president not to brush away or outright dismiss that Americans are feeling squeezed byrising prices.
They have pressed the president to express greater sympathy and adopt a message that contrasts his agenda with congressional Democrats’, rather than with an ex-president who has little remaining sway even within his own party.
“Joe Biden is no longer a threat to them because he’s out of office, he’s never going to be in office again,” the Trump adviser said, arguing that the president needs instead to focus on selling his policies and reassuring voters that more help is on the way. “You’ve got to feel their pain. You’ve got to talk about it every day.”
As part of that push, Trump’s advisers have been actively putting “policy time” — as one of the officials characterized it — on the president’s schedule with the goal of accelerating the administration’s efforts to tackle inflation.
Part of the strategy,first reported by CNN, is aimed at having the president travel the country to better communicate his economic platform, such as with his visit to Mount Pocono on Tuesday.
Starting early next year, the White House wants to get into a weekly rhythm of having the president take day trips to cities across the country tied to the issue, a senior White House official told CNN.
Tuesday’s event — in a district Trump carried by nearly 9 points and which GOP Rep. Rob Bresnahan narrowly flipped in 2024 — will put the president’s messaging to the test.
During a Monday roundtable highlighting the administration’sefforts to aid farmers, Trump indicated he was aware of the need to adopt a stronger message on the economy, insisting several times that he was focused on “fixing the problem.”
“It’s a very simple statement: They caused it, we’re fixing it,” Trump said of his rebuttal to Democrats’ affordability arguments. “We inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country, and we’re taking it.”
Inside the White House, officials believe they can still regain ground on the economy, pointing to progress on lowering gas prices and the cost of eggs, as well as tax relief set to take effect next year that they argue will benefit some voters — even if few of them are aware of it.
Several officials also argue that many of the policies enacted thus far — such as energy deregulations and other provisions in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that passed over the summer — need time to work their way to Americans’ pockets. It’s a message they’ve also given to Trump during their meetings on tackling the affordability issue, they said.
Aides are also on the hunt for more ways to demonstrate that they’re focused on cost-of-living issues, from slashing the price of beef to holding out hope that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates and bring mortgage rates down.
But just as critical as making progress on affordability is ensuring voters feel it, aides and advisers acknowledged. And while Trump has been told he needs to make a more sympathetic case, he’s remained reluctant so far to buy into that approach completely.
“We brought prices way down from what it was,” Trump said Monday, declaring inflation “essentially gone” despite an acceleration in prices in recent months. “We’re going to have the greatest economy in history.”"
Phones might get pricier next year. Thank the AI boom,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/tech/memory-shortage-phone-computer-prices,"Dec 5, 2025, 5:01 AM ET","Fancy cameras, giant screens andmassive storageusually make smartphones more expensive. But next year, it’s a routine component that might be boosting prices: memory.
And it’s not just phones. Any device that uses memory, from phones to tablets and smartwatches, could get pricier.
Memory prices are rising for consumer products because major manufacturers are instead ramping up production for AI data centers as artificial intelligence companies boom.
“It’s pretty much brutal and crunched across the board,” said Yang Wang, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.
TheInternational Data Corporation, a global market research firm, reported earlier this week that the smartphone market is expected to decline by 0.9% in 2026 in part because of memory shortages. Memory prices are expected to surge by 30% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and may climb an additional 20% early next year,Counterpoint Researchsaid last month.
Tech companies like Meta, Microsoft and Google have aggressively expanded theirdata centers and infrastructurethis year to keep up with AI demand. And that growth is expected to continue: A report fromMcKinsey & Companyindicates companies will invest nearly $7 trillion in data center infrastructure-related costs globally by 2030.
That’s prompted memory manufacturers like Micron and Samsung to shift their focus to data centers, which usea different type of memorythan computers and smartphones. As a result, there are fewer resources for consumer products, said Wang.
Memory and storage companyMicron announced on Wednesdaythat it’s exiting the consumer memory business, citing a “surge in demand” coming from “AI-driven growth” in data centers.
Jaejune Kim, executive vice president for memory at Samsung, said in October that the companysaw strong demand for memory for AI and data centers in the third quarter. He also said the supply shortage for mobile and PC memory is expected to “intensify further.”
Gadget makers may have to face tough decisions about when to launch and how to price their products, analysts say.TrendForce, a research firm that follows the semiconductor industry, estimates memory price hikes have made smartphones 8% to 10% more expensive to produce in 2025 (higher production costs don’t always translate into higher consumer prices for a variety of reasons).
Some smartphones could cost moreas soon as early next year, said Nabila Popal, a senior research director for the International Data Corporation. Cheap Android phones may see the biggest impact, since less expensive products usually have thinner margins.
“It’s going to be almost impossible for them to not raise prices” of cheaper Android phones,said Popal.
Companies may also postpone phone launches to focus on expensive models that may be more profitable. The average selling price for smartphones is expected to climb to $465 in 2026, compared to $457 in 2025, according to Popal, putting the smartphone market at a record high value of $578.9 billion.
But the pendulum is expected to swing back in the other direction late next year as the supply chain adjusts, according to Popal and Wang, potentially bringing prices back down or at least capping increases.
The semiconductor industry is used to grappling with change as new technologies emerge, says Wang. But it may have not been prepared for how quickly AI demand would grow.
“In the semiconductor space, there’s always going to be a mismatch (in supply and demand),” he said. “This was kind of unexpected.”"
Pro-AI super PAC launches first candidate ads,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/tech/pro-ai-super-pac-launches-first-candidate-ads,"Dec 10, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","A new pro-AI network of political action committees is releasing its first candidate ads in the 2026 midterms, as the debate around artificial intelligence ramps up ahead of the elections.
The ads from Leading the Future, a pro-AI bipartisan network of associated PACs, focus on congressional races in Texas and New York and are a likely preview of the vast amounts of money the technology industry could spend ahead of next year’s elections. The ads were shared first with CNN.
Leading the Future said these ads are the “opening phase” of its effort in the upcoming midterm elections; the two ads are part of seven-figure ad campaign for the respective primaries, with more to come, the group told CNN.
Other groups are also breaking out their wallets: Two former members of Congress, Democrat Brad Carson and Republican Chris Stewart, have joined forces to create a new organization called Public First, and network of super PACs that will back efforts and candidates who want to regulate AI. Meta recentlylaunchedits own bipartisan super PAC called American Technology Excellence Project, which aims in part to counter efforts to regulate AI at the state level.
The stakes are enormous: In just a few years, AI has become a major driver of the US stock market and a force in the economy, as well as a major player in people’s everyday lives. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) became the world’s first $5 trillion company earlier this year after demand for its products surged. Meta, OpenAI, Alphabet, Oracle, Apple, Microsoft and other Big Tech companies have poured billions of dollars into hiring, research and development of AI products, looking for ways to secure a lead in the AI race and dominate a still-growing market.
But critics say the rush to build ever-more complex AI models carries enormous risks in areas like privacy and child safety, with a regulatory framework that lags far behind the rapid advances in technology. And even some tech pioneers warn that AI poses potential dangers to the economy and to the world.
Recentpollingfrom the Pew Research Center released in November shows nearly identical percentages of Republicans and Democrats say they are more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life. And in September,Gallupfound 80% of US adults “believe the government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security, even if it means developing AI capabilities more slowly.”
Leading the Future advocates for a federal regulatory framework on AI instead of state level regulations – a policy favored by the industry and President Donald Trump’s administration.
On Monday,Trump said heplans to signan executive order preempting artificial intelligence regulations at the state level in favor of a federal level “rulebook,” though it’s not clear what that would look like. The Trump administration argues state regulations threaten to stymie America’s AI industry, which is a national security priority.
Congress could take up a possible framework for AI regulation within the next year – House Democratsannouncedon Tuesday they are setting up a Democratic Commission on AI and the Innovation Economy to “develop policy expertise in partnership” with AI companies and otherstakeholders.
Leading the Future’s new ads underscore this divide, with one ad in support of a Texas candidate and another targeting a New York candidate.
Oneadsupports Chris Gober, a lawyer running in the Republican primary for the new Texas 10thcongressional district. The ad calls Gober, who previously worked with Elon Musk on his America Super PAC as well as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a stalwart “Trump conservative.” Though the ad is paid for by American Mission, part of Leading the Future’s network, it does not mention AI directly, only referring to “promoting American technology investment” in the race to beat China.
Gober told CNN in an email that he’s running to “champion” the “world-class innovators” in his district and to promote policies “that ensure America wins the global technology race.”
The secondadtargets New York State Assemblyman Alex Bores, who is running in New York’s 12th congressional district and has made a name for himself as an outspoken voice for AI safety guardrails. And unlike Gober’s ad, the ad targeting Bores from Leading the Future’s Think Big PAC leans heavily into criticizing Bores for wanting to regulate AI at the state level.
In response, Bores criticized President Trump’s recent actions on AI and what he called a “handful of AI billionaires” angry because he “would dare to stand up to them to protect our jobs, our kids’ minds, and our security.”"
See how housing affordability has changed in US metro areas,https://www.cnn.com/us/housing-costs-affordability-metro-areas-vis,"Sep 27, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","The cost of owning a home in the US has surged since the Covid-19 pandemic. The median home price in August was $413,000, up from $321,000 during the same month in 2020 — a 28% increase, according tofederal data.
To better understand this strain on some families, CNN turned to ahome ownership affordability indexpublished by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. It measures the affordability for median-income households across the United States who are hoping to buy a median-priced home in a given area.
The index compares the actual median household income to the “qualified” income needed to keep annual housing costs at or below 30%.
An index score of 100 or higher indicates the median household income is enough to afford the median-priced home based at that threshold. A score less than 100 means the median income is not enough for a median-priced home.
CNN is tracking this index as it’s periodically updated by the Atlanta Fed. Look up your area to see the trends over time — and how they compare with the national average.
“The HOAM index is designed to easily track affordability over time in the United States across geographies,” said Domonic Purviance, a real estate expert with the Atlanta Fed who helped develop thetool.
The center of gravity on affordability has shifted dramatically across the country during the last five years, according to a CNN analysis of the data.
Most metropolitan areas are now on the more expensive side of the threshold.
This nationwide shift varies by region.
Today, most metropolitan areas in the West, for example, are too expensive for the median household under the income threshold. The Midwest has gotten dramatically more expensive, too.
The Atlanta Fed’s data comes from itsHome Ownership Affordability Monitor, or HOAM. It factors in the monthly principal and interest cost, given the current mortgage interest rates, as well as taxes, property insurance and private mortgage insurance in the total cost of home ownership.
The Atlanta Fed’s housing data is available at both the national level and for individual core-based statistical areas, or CBSAs. It’s updated monthly, though there’s typically a two-month lag — mainly because of the time it takes to record and collect home sales deeds. In some regions, the data can show noticeable fluctuations due to seasonal changes in median home prices or shifts in the volume of sales used to calculate those medians."
"The US economy added 119,000 jobs in September, but unemployment rose to a nearly four-year high",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/economy/us-jobs-report-september-final,"Nov 20, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Along-awaited jobs reportoffered a mixed picture of the US labor market.
The economy added 119,000 jobs in September, an unexpected rebound for the labor market — but it comes as the overall economy shows signs of slowing. However, the unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, the highest it’s been in nearly four years.
Economists were expecting 50,000 jobs to have been added and an unemployment rate that remained at 4.3%, according to FactSet.
Delayed for seven weeks due to the government shutdown, the latest snapshot of America’s job market showed that unemployment rose in September to the highest level in nearly four years.
In addition, August’s tepid job gains of 22,000 were revised to a job loss of 4,000 jobs and July was revised down by 7,000 jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday.
The health care and social assistance sector continued to drive overall employment growth. Those sectors added an estimated 57,100 jobs in September, accounting for nearly half of the overall gains. Leisure and hospitality contributed 47,000 jobs during a month with unseasonably warm weather.
Jobs were lost in sectors such as transportation and warehousing (-25,300), temporary help services (-15,900) and manufacturing (-6,000).
Although the September employment data has been on the shelf since early October,it provides a critical snapshotof the labor market at a time when tariffs, stubborn inflation and elevated interest rates continue to slow the US economy.
Plus, Thursday’s report might very well be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since theshutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during Octoberand part of November. The BLS on Wednesday announced that there will not be a separate October jobs report published but instead some of that data will be included in the November report scheduled for December 16.
Despite the stronger-than-expected September gains, this year is still on pace for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.
“The job market was really weak in the summer, and it didn’t improve much in September,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Credit Union. “What we learned today is that both June and August had negative job growth, so, shedding jobs; 119,000 is pretty good for September, but when you step back, the average (monthly job gain) of the past four months is in the low 40,000s.”
“So, it looks very weak,” she added.
Unemployment, a closely watched recession indicator, ticked higher in September, rising to the highest rate since October 2021.
However, driving the jobless rate higher was an increase in the labor force – primarily an uplift in more people looking for work, versus a sharp increase in layoffs, BLS data shows.
The job gains remain heavily concentrated. Two sectors – health care and social assistance, and leisure and hospitality – accounted for 87% of September’s job growth.
But in a labor market that’s been in a low-hire, low-fire slog, there are also few opportunities for those seeking work. On average, it’s taking people six months to find work, according to the latest BLS data.
The latest unemployment claims data supports that trend: In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that an estimated 1.974 million people filed continuing claims for unemployment insurance for the week ended November 8, hitting a fresh four-year high.
Initial claims, which are considered the best proxy for layoff activity, fell to 220,000 last week, remaining well below more concerning thresholds (300,000 to 400,000 range, consistently).
“If I had to characterize it, it still looks a lot like ‘no-hire, no-fire,’” Long said. “I do worry, given the number of industries that are starting to fire, that this is starting to look like ‘no-hire, start-to-fire.’”
Despite the mixed bag of data, the September report “could throw cold water” on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates further when it meets in December, Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, wrote in a note on Thursday.
“The sharp rebound in employment gains, up 119,000 in September following the downwardly revised negative 4,000 print in August soothes concerns that the labor market was on the precipice of a large downturn and removes urgency for another rate cut,” she wrote.
Still, because of the historic government shutdown, the September jobs report will be the freshest official monthly employment snapshot available when the Fed makes its next interest rate decision on December 10. The partial October and full November data won’t come out until the following week."
Trump may have broken Wall Street,https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/17/business/wall-street-trump-fire-fed-powell-nightcap,,"A version of this story appeared in the CNN Business Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.
This past April, when President Donald Trump started flirting with the notion of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell,stocks and the dollar tumbledbecause investors worried that even talking about such a move crossed a red line. You can’t even joke about that, the Wall Street intellectuals told us — the central bank’s independence is simply too important.
Powell himself said it wasnot permittedunder the law, and a choir of Wall Street analysts chirped about thesanctityof the Federal Reserve’s independence.
Cut to July: Trump is waving a draft of Powell’s termination letter in front of lawmakers, and Wall Street is cruising.
Stocks remain near record highs. The dollar and bond markets briefly jolted but recovered after Trump denied reports he was preparing to fire Powell.
This seems to point to two possibilities:
Trouble is, there’s only one way to find out, and that involves crossing the red line that Trump has been inching ever closer to.
ICYMI:The president on Tuesday nighttold lawmakers in a meetingthat he was going to fire Powell, possibly as soon as Wednesday, over a costly renovation at the Federal Reserve headquarters, according to a source briefed on the president’s remarks who spoke to my CNN colleagues.
Trump even gestured to a document he claimed was a termination letter for Powell, a person who was in the room told CNN.
Related articleTrump says it’s ‘highly unlikely’ he’ll fire Powell after suggesting otherwise in meeting with lawmakers
Then, on Wednesday, Trump said publicly that firing Powell was “highly unlikely … unless he has to leave for fraud.” (Coincidentally, Trump’s OMB head has accused Powell of lying to Congress about the renovation, which Trump on Tuesday said he believes is afireable offense.)
Put simply: The US has never been this close to seeing what happens when the president moves to unseat the Fed chair. Everyone on Wall Street and across Corporate America should be freaking out.
Just this past Friday, George Saravelos, global head of FX strategy at Deutsche Bank, wrote that it is “stating the obvious” that investors would interpret Powell’s firing as a “direct affront to Fed independence,” which is widely seen as vital to managing inflation.
“The empirical and academic evidence on the impact of a loss of central bank independence is fairly clear,” Saravelos wrote. “In extreme cases, both the currency and the bond market can collapse as inflation expectations move higher, real yields drop and broader risk premia increase on the back of institutional erosion.”
Of course, nothing like *waves hands wildly* all of this has ever happened. And the empirical evidence may be showing that markets, like everything else, can become so conditioned to chaos that all the old rules no longer apply.
“Markets appear to be getting accustomed to a pattern, most notable in the area of tariffs, in which the Administration threatens fairly radical action, only to dial it back when the initial market reacts negatively,” Jonathan Doh, professor of management at Villanova School of Business, said in an email. “In each successive round, the responses have been increasingly muted.”
This is the much-buzzed-about TACO trade — the idea that “Trump always chickens out” — that has proven profitable this year. If there’s a Trump-related sell-off, investors buy the dip, wait for Trump to change his mind or scale back the offending policy, and then ride the rally. (Increasingly, though, investors are skipping the whole panic-selling part and just assuming nothing Trump says is real until some watered-down version of it has actually happened.)
To be clear, even though stock markets shrugged at reports of Powell’s imminent firing, the news did provoke some movement in the currency and bond markets. Wednesday morning, before Trump’s denial, gold, the classic safe haven, and long-term bond yields went up, while the dollar fell almost 1%.
Those reactions are pretty much what you’d expect, said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, though he noted that “in theory, the bond vigilantes should have reacted more vigorously,” to the news. (“Bond vigilantes” are investors who use their buying power to signal their disapproval of a policy — they were a big reason why Trump decided to pause some tariffs for 90 days back in April.)
But stocks’ relatively muted response, he said, could reflect some troubling dynamics on the Street.
First, traders may be signaling that they are more excited about the prospect of lower interest rates (the No. 1 thing Trump wants from the Fed) than they are worried about the central bank’s protection from the political fray.
Stock investors, he said, may be “so enamored with the idea of lower rates that they don’t care if they come as the result of governmental interference.”
Which is a pretty wild idea!
When I asked Sosnick if the Fed’s independence may not be as precious to the market as market participants have long claimed, he said:
“I will assert that central bank independence is critical, and I think that I’m not alone with that belief,” he added. “But maybe not.”
More worrisome, perhaps, is how the Trump administration perceives the market’s reaction.
“We have to wonder if the earlier report was a trial balloon designed to see how markets might react if Powell were indeed fired,” Sosnick said. “Quite frankly, the relatively muted reactions from stocks and the 10-year bond might have increased the president’s willingness to take action, since the initial reaction was hardly catastrophic.”"
China used its trade juggernaut to withstand US tariffs. Can it keep its edge?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/14/china/china-us-trade-war-global-exports-intl-hnk-dst,"Nov 14, 2025, 7:37 PM ET","As US duties on Chinese imports spun higher and higher earlier this year, Derek Wang braced for major disruption.
With US orders ground to a halt, Wang, 36, who sells intelligent cookware out of southern China’s Guangdong province, looked elsewhere to fill the gap. After finding new buyers in Brazil, Japan, Malaysia and Cambodia, he learned what he describes as a key lesson: “Nothing is more important than the markets close to us.”
Stories like Wang’s have played out across China’s vast economy where businesses, large and small, scrambled to fill the void after temporary triple-digit duties – and the threat of their return – upended Chinese exports to the world’s wealthiest market.
The result has been a coup for China’s trade juggernaut.
Instead of seeing exports falter on lost US business, the world’s largest manufacturer has driven them deeper into other markets around the world – building on the country’s global economic footprint and hedges companies made during Trump’s first trade war.
The resilience gave Beijing confidence in its months-long negotiations with the US, which came to a head in October when leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met and agreed to a truce that whittles new tariffs on Chinese goods down to 20%.
But the push also puts China on track to eclipse last year’s gaping nearly $1 trillion global trade surplus – a balance that’s irritated governments around the world and sparked Trump’s trade war in the first place.
There were already questions about the sustainability of China’s export blitz before data released last week showed exports unexpectedly contracted by just over 1% year on year in October – the first downturn since February.
Whether China can maintain its level of exports to the rest of the world – and expand back into the US market after the recent truce, is a consequential question for the world’s second-largest economy as it continues to struggle with lackluster demand from its own consumers, but doubles down on manufacturing as its economic cornerstone.
So far this year, the shift in China’s export flows has been stark – and sent a clear message that, for China, the US is not irreplaceable.
While exports to the US dropped nearly 18% in the first 10 months of this year versus that period in 2024, they were up more than 7% to the European Union, 14% to countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and 26% to Africa, according to Chinese customs data released last week. Overall, exports rose 5.3%.
In Southeast Asia, that trade was buoyed by leaps in the export of machine tools, automobile parts and computer components. In Africa, construction machinery and green technologies have been key exports, analysts say, while parts of Latin America have seen significant growth in electric vehicles, chemical fertilizers and electronics, among other areas.
This trade engine was humming before the start of the trade war.
Already the world’s manufacturing superpower, China’s rapid climb to dominate green technologies like EVs, lithium-ion batteries, and solar panels, had driven up demand from countries looking to convert to renewable energy cheaply – and concern from those accusing China of unfair competition with subsidized products.
Some of those goods – like EVs and solar panels – were already effectively barred from the US market by high tariffs put in place in recent years, and China’s exporters have been building out trade across developing markets.
“(China) has prepared quite well for this,” said Jacob Gunter, who heads the economy and industry program at the MERICS think tank in Berlin.
“It wasn’t some miracle of foresight thinking to predict that the United States would escalate over time its trade and technology conflict with China, but China was (expanding markets) before the trade and tech war began, and ever since it’s started, that trend has really accelerated,” he said.
Even as many companies had to scramble to divert business from the US market in recent months, experts say the groundwork for the pivot was laid by Beijing’s decades-long push to build out its global economic footprint – expanding trade while also bankrolling ports, terminals and highways under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative.
It’s also relied on an earlier push from Chinese firms to move supply chains and production centers out of China to areas from Southeast Asia to Mexico – where goods are shipped from China to be fabricated or finished.
“That’s the key for the so-called resilience of Chinese exports,” said Yao Yang, dean of the Di-shui-hu Advanced Finance Institute at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, who noted these investments began during Trump’s first term.
“Without those outbound investments, I don’t think that China can cope with the shock.”
But Beijing’s trade resilience has also raised fears that a deluge of Chinese goods into other markets will wipe out domestic industries.
Countries have been hitting back with probes on Chinese goods, with the US and India, as well as Mexico and Brazil, together raising 79 anti-dumping and countervailing probes against Chinese goods in the first half of this year – a significant uptick from recent years before 2024, according to World Trade Organization data.
There’s also calls for exports or factory relocations to come alongside greater levels of local investment, knowledge transfer and more balanced trade.
For some Latin American countries, “deindustrialization is a big problem when Chinese companies start to invest … because they bring just the assembly, they don’t do technology and knowledge transfer,” said Diego Rodriguez, logistics and industrial practice leader at Americas Market Intelligence, a research firm in Miami, noting countries like Brazil are pushing back against this.
In Southeast Asia, the stronger flow of goods is a concern, according to Rebecca Sta Maria, former executive director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation secretariat.
“We feel as if we are being swamped. I remember one economy saying a ‘tsunami of Chinese goods coming into ASEAN.’ Of course that’s a concern to us,” said Sta Maria, now the director of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. But it wasn’t all negative, she added, because small and medium-sized businesses were using high-end components from China, making their products more competitive.
“I know that the Chinese government has acknowledged (the concern) to some extent, so now it’s how do we manage this?”
Beijing denies accusations that its goods are flooding markets. Its officials have instead taken Trump’s global trade shake-up as an opportunity to tout China as the reliable trade partner, while pledging to open its vast market wider to exporters and investors from around the world.
Observers say some countries may also be unwilling to throw up barriers to China at a time when they are facing higher tariffs on their own goods into the US – that’s especially when there is true demand in many countries.
In Africa, “it’s a two-way street,” said Capital Economics emerging market analyst David Omojomolo.
“These countries (in Africa) want to industrialize… there’s a massive electricity gap across the continent – solar panels are cheap and China’s got overcapacity … they need to send them somewhere, so of course, Africa is going to benefit.”
Even still, manufacturers across China have struggled to fill the hole left by the drop in US exports.
Factory employees in recent months have described to CNN canceled shifts, mandatory furloughs and lost jobs as employers deciding to relocate out of China.
Garment maker Zhang Peipei in Jiangxi province told CNN she has been able to keep her 20-year-old business afloat through smaller revenue streams coming from outside the US. But she says the unpredictable US tariff policies have already caused “serious and irreversible long-term impact” without clear alternatives.
With her business now hanging on whether she can cut a deal with buyers in Mexico, Zhang said she didn’t feel “very confident,” even despite a potential return of some US business now, “since the US has been shaking up the foreign trade scene, the whole world is chaotic right now.”
And there are questions about whether China’s robust trade data this year showed true demand or a short-term push to get goods out of the country to stockpile them or ship them to the US via a third country with lower tariffs.
An analysis of US and Chinese trade data from April to July – including the height of the trade uncertainty – suggests that just less than a quarter of China’s trade diverted from the US was likely still ultimately ending up in the US, while the rest of the goods were finding alternative markets, according to Gerard DiPippo, a senior researcher at the RAND China Research Center.
“Still, l’m not all that confident that the final demand for all those (other) exports going to the Global South is actually going to be remaining in those countries,” he said, noting that exporters could also be building up offshore inventories as they waited to see how countries’ trade talks with the US played out.
“The big caveat,” he added, is that “the margins of Chinese exporters are almost certainly getting squeezed … they’re maintaining high volumes in real terms, but they’re doing it by cutting prices.”
The recent truce between Xi and Trump leaves tariffs on Chinese goods at around 47% on average, but could see the return of more US business.
But as uncertainty remains across the global economy, a driving focus for those in China, both in the factories and the government, will be on expanding how much the country’s own consumers buy domestic-made goods.
That’s the case for Wang, the cookware maker in Guangdong. Despite finding new clients outside the US, he is also making another pivot, directing more of his business to China’s domestic market, and less of it outside, he said."
"Chinese gamblers, cartel cash: The secret pipeline through Las Vegas’ biggest casino",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/us/chinese-gambling-wynn-casinos-cash-middlemen-invs-vis,"Nov 18, 2025, 6:00 AM ET","Lei Zhang walked out of the desert heat into the cool air of a Las Vegas casino floor, his eyes hidden behind sunglasses. Zhang strolled past the buzzing crowds around the blackjack tables, skirted the clanging slot machines and headed to a hotel room.
He carried with him a satchel full of cash and a dark secret: He was a key player in a suspected global money-laundering scheme – one that catered to high-rolling Chinese gamblers and that investigators would later tie to some of the world’s most dangerous criminal gangs.
For years, authorities have battled an illicit black market for US dollars fueled by strict Chinese government restrictions on its citizens. Affluent Chinese nationals looking to bypass those rules pay middlemen to procure millions in cash – often sourced from Mexican cartels looking to rinse clean their illicit profits from fentanyl and other drug sales.
Now, a CNN investigation that included a review of hundreds of pages of court documents and interviews with more than half a dozen law enforcement sources reveals new details about a little recognized participant in this booming market: American casinos.
At one high-profile casino, some of the staff were even in on the scheme.
Last year, Wynn Las Vegas agreed in a non-prosecution agreement to pay the federal government $130 million for essentially helping to put illegal money in the hands of big-stakes gamblers in thelargest criminal forfeitureby a casino in US history. The casino, which was founded by Steve Wynn, who stepped down as the CEO of Wynn Resorts in 2018, wasfinedanother $5.5 million by state regulators in May to resolve the same case.
But the details of the multiple criminal cases that sparked those massive fines have largely been kept under wraps – until now.
A key factor in those settlements, investigators said, was evidence gathered in the case against Zhang and three other defendants, all of whom admitted to helping wealthy Chinese gamblers avoid currency restrictions so they could spend tens of thousands of dollars at Wynn and other casinos. At Wynn, the fraud was often facilitated by employees.
Law enforcement officials told CNN they had evidence that money provided by Zhang and others — none of whom were employed by the Wynn casino, but rather worked as middlemen providing gamblers with cash — came from prostitution, human smuggling and the street sale of deadly drugs.
At the casino, gamblers skirted “foreign and U.S. laws governing monetary transfer and reporting,” including the Bank Secrecy Act or Anti-Money Laundering laws, the Department of Justice said.
Neither the casino nor the four defendants admitted to knowingly laundering money for cartels or anyone else. But some investigators said that their actions helped bad actors hide the source of their illicit money.
“Federal laws that regulate the reporting of financial transactions are in place to detect and stop illegal activities,” said Carissa Messick, the special agent in charge for the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigations unit in Las Vegas, in a statement at the time. “Deliberately avoiding Bank Secrecy Act requirements is a form of money laundering.”
In a statement to CNN, Wynn Resorts said the company fully cooperated with the investigation and “immediately terminated the few employees involved because their actions violated the Company’s compliance program.”
“Wynn is committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity, compliance, and regulatory responsibility,” the Wynn casino said. “We accept responsibility for the historical deficiencies identified, have taken meaningful remediation, and are dedicated to ensuring that such failures do not reoccur.”
The cases of the four defendants that helped lead to Wynn’s historic settlement show how casinos have profited from having dirty money come through their coffers, and how drug cartels seek to legitimize the huge profits they generate from the sale of fentanyl and other drugs through legal gambling establishments, experts and investigators said. One prosecutor in Zhang’s case estimated that at least a hundred million dollars annually was being laundered through American casinos.
“Forty-eight hours ago, that was the proceeds of fentanyl,” said Chris Urben, a former assistant special agent in charge with the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Special Operations Division, speaking about some of the cash that Zhang and others moved through the Wynn and other casinos.
Although federal regulators and authorities have cracked down on banks and demanded tighter scrutiny on the cash deposits favored by cartels, regulators have been slower to apply that same pressure to casinos — despite their financial interest in looking the other way or even facilitating these crimes.
“They haven’t received as much scrutiny as financial institutions have in the past,” said Ian Messenger, founder and CEO of the Association of Certified Gaming Compliance Specialists in Toronto. “That is changing, with cases like Wynn.”
The schemes to move illicit money at Vegas casinos traced back to a simple problem: High-rolling gamblers from China — who are known to drop up to a million dollars on a single hand of blackjack — were having problems accessing their funds in the US.
A corruptioncrackdownby the Chinese government starting around 2016 led to stricter enforcement of rules prohibiting individuals from taking more than $50,000 a year out of the country.
For US authorities, this rule has created supersized demand among well-heeled Chinese visitors and expats. When they need large sums for purchasing real estate, buying a luxury car or other big expenses, many turn to underground bankers.
These illicit bankers, who are also often Chinese, have turned to criminal gangs such as Mexican drug cartels and prostitution rings, law enforcement officials told CNN.
In exchange for cash, the cartels and other providers are paid back through Chinese bank accounts that face no US financial scrutiny.
In recent years, these Chinese middlemen have essentially become the go-to bankers for the biggest players in the US drug trade, authorities have said, wresting control from Latin American interests in what has amounted to a bloodless coup.
And high-stakes Chinese gamblers quickly became important players in the financial scheme, authorities say.
In late 2018, Dave Mesler, a special agent with the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigation unit, got an intriguing tip from employees at another Las Vegas casino.
They’d noticed a strange pattern: A man would walk into the casino carrying a satchel and then would meet a host — a casino employee in charge of keeping high-value gamblers happy. The host would summon a high-roller, and the trio would disappear to a private setting like a hotel room. Then the man who came with the satchel would depart, often without having gambled.
Staff at the casino, which Mesler confirmed was not Wynn but declined to identify due to DOJ policy, eventually notified law enforcement about a handful of men all following the same pattern.
“The casino didn’t quite figure out what they were up to,” Mesler said, but “they realized these guys were up to something.”
Mesler and other investigators soon learned the IDs of four of the men: Lei Zhang, Bing Han, Liang Zhou and Fan Wang. All were Chinese nationals in their late 30s or 40s living in Las Vegas. (None of the men responded to CNN’s multiple efforts to reach them. )
Mesler, who at the time led the IRS’s Las Vegas Financial Crimes Task Force, subpoenaed their cell records. The results excited him so much he flew from his office in Las Vegas to San Diego to meet with a federal prosecutor.
“I found that these guys were talking to Wynn casino hosts multiple times a day every day,” Mesler said. “Hundreds a week. … I mean, I don’t even talk to my girlfriend this much.”
Investigators had already been interested in Wynn, a high-end resort with a sleek glass design with locations worldwide, including Macao – the only place in China where gambling is legal.
Investigators had earlier looked into bank accounts they suspected were being used by drug cartels to fund gambling at the casino, DEA sources said, but none of those probes led to any charges being filed. (Wynn said in its statement that the accounts were “established to allow out-of-state guests to make normal and customary payments to the Company” and that the casino followed all proper financial reporting procedures.)
Mesler believed something bigger was afoot with the new evidence involving the four Chinese men.
“It was happening now – it didn’t happen years ago,” Mesler said. “This breathed a lot of new energy into the case.”
Mesler started reviewing surveillance footage from Wynn, and sure enough, the four men were making regular visits with casino hosts and high-rolling gamblers there.
With the evidence mounting in early 2019, other agencies joined thecase: the US attorney’s office in San Diego, the DEA, the Department of Homeland Security and even the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.
Through surveillance footage, undercover assignments and interviews with informants and the defendants, investigators were able to piece together a more complete picture of the sophisticated scheme.
Investigators began watching as the four underground bankers or couriers working for them drove in and around Las Vegas and Los Angeles making cash pickups, law enforcement sources told CNN.
“They would take cash from anybody that had cash they didn’t want to deposit in a bank account for various reasons,” Mesler said.
The men would then shuttle the ill-gotten cash to Wynn and other casinos in Vegas, where they would meet with a casino host and an elite gambler from China for a hand-off.
“It didn’t always happen in a hotel room, but it could. It could happen in the hotel bathroom as well,” said Peter Fuller, a former detective in the Las Vegas police department who worked on the case. “It also happened in vehicles.”
Phone data seized from the four suspects showed they were frequently communicating with Wynn casino hosts, said Urben, the former DEA official — but also that some of their communications traced back to Mexican cartel operatives. He added that other intelligence, including surveillance and post-arrest interviews, also pointed to cartels as a significant source of cash.
CNN obtained an unclassified internal DEA document, which reported that agents suspected money launderers were feeding cash from Latin American drug cartels to Chinese gamblers, who were “reliable customers to purchase cash drug proceeds.” The intelligence report, which was shared with field offices across the country in 2021, also linked Vegas casino hosts with members of US-based drug trafficking organizations “seeking to launder drug proceeds.”
“The majority and the driver of this was Mexican cartel proceeds,” said Urben, who now works as a managing director at Nardello & Co., a private global investigations firm that specializes in corporate matters. “When I say that, I mean fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine.”
A Homeland Security investigator, who worked closely on the case and asked that his name not be used out of safety concerns, said much of the cash being sold by underground bankers to Chinese gamblers in Vegas at the time appeared to come from cartels.
It’s unclear how much the casino hosts or Chinese gamblers knew about the source of the money when coordinating the transactions, officials said.
But they all knew enough to be secretive about the activity, the Homeland Security investigator said, “so they must have known they were doing something bad.”
After using a Chinese social-messaging and mobile-payment app called WeChat to make a quick money transfer, the gambler would often take the cash, bring it inside the casino and exchange it for chips, officials said.
The end result was that everybody got what they wanted. The casino host got the golden-goose gambler to play at Wynn, the gambler received the cash, the “third-party” source was able to replace their dirty cash with a clean deposit in a financial institution, and the underground banker got his fee, all without having to send hefty dollar amounts across international borders.
In May 2019, investigators on the case carried out the first sting operation. It targeted Zhang.
Zhang had been lured to a Las Vegas casino hotel room by an undercover federal agent who called the money mover posing as a wealthy gambler looking to obtain $150,000 in cash.
As he made his way through the casino floor to the hotel room, agents working with Homeland Security Investigations waited in an adjoining room. Zhang had been instructed to show up alone, but he came with a woman. Zhang knocked on the door and the undercover agent answered.
The agents barged in.
“He looked very cool and suave,” said the Homeland Security investigator. “Cool sunglasses and hair. … Very Vegas.”
The agents opened the satchel and discovered four brick-sized stacks of cash, the investigator said.
The woman, who had a handful of cell phones on her, was a “madam” who ran an escort service, he said. Two-thirds of the cash belonged to her, and she wanted to make sure the transaction went smoothly. The agents seized the cash; the woman was not arrested, he said.
That bust, he added, helped lead investigators to the other three suspects, who were arrested in similar stings throughout Las Vegas that summer.
With the evidence collected by Mesler and others, Zhang, Han, Zhou and Wang were charged in federal court between May and September of 2019 with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.
Prosecutors said their scheme was just a fraction of the illicit money moving through casinos.
“The total magnitude of this problem, especially in Las Vegas, catering to high-roller Chinese gamblers who come into Las Vegas without easy access to United States cash, is certainly in the nine figures on an annual basis,” said prosecutor Mark Pletcher during Zhang’s sentencing hearing in 2020. “We’re talking about a problem in the hundred-million dollar range” yearly, he added.
In court, the defendants — who had all emigrated from China — described how they’d been drawn into the underground banking schemes because they needed money to help care for children or elderly parents, in a country where they had few connections and spoke little English.
By fall of 2020, all four pleaded guilty to a lesser crime than money laundering: operating an “unlicensed money transmitting business.” Investigators told CNN the money-laundering charge would require proving that the defendants themselves knew the source of the dirty cash they were bringing into the casino.
But another prosecutor, Daniel Silva, told the court that the activity “totally undermines the United States’ anti-money laundering laws.”
The networks, he added, “are a huge, huge problem in the United States” and “will not be tolerated.”
Zhou, now 42, was ordered to repay the government $446,000. He was sentenced to six months in prison.
The lightest sentence went to Wang, who received three months in home detention and was ordered to repay $225,000 for his role in the scheme.
A former professional poker player who also worked in the “junket” industry that brought Chinese gamblers to Las Vegas, Wang, now about 43, was charged last year with lying about his felony conviction while trying to purchase a semiautomatic assault rifle in Las Vegas, court documents state. He pleaded guilty to the weapons charge in April and was sentenced to time served.
The steepest forfeiture penalty went to Han, now 50, who was ordered to repay $500,000. Han told the courts he was granted asylum in the US in 2019 after suffering religious persecution in China for starting a church in his home, according to court records.
The stiffest prison sentence went to Zhang, now about 45, who’d claimed through his lawyer in court that he had no idea he was doing anything wrong. The judge handed Zhang 15 months in prison and ordered him to repay $150,000 – a formality as authorities had already seized that amount in the raid.
Fuller, the former detective with the Las Vegas police department, said it’s important to recognize the harm in the crime.
“You just can’t go take cash from anybody, because what ends up happening is, you end up taking it from Pablo Escobar,” said Fuller, who now works as a special agent for the IRS. “It’s basically the same thing that took place in the ’30s with Al Capone and all that, all the bankers and everybody. ‘Oh no, I, I don’t sell drugs. I’m not in organized crime. I just set up companies for people. I just move money.’”
Last fall, a little over two years after the last of the four men were sentenced, Wynn casino signed the non-prosecution agreement and admitted to its employees’ involvement in a range of schemes, including those catering to high-rolling Chinese gamblers. The casino, in a statement to CNN, said it was unaware of the details of the four individual criminal cases as they played out in court.
The agreement also highlighted earlier cases dating back to 2014 in which the Wynn casino “knowingly and intentionally conspired” with individuals – some with connections to Latin America – to set up illicit ways to get money to gamblers at the casino and to recruit foreign gamblers from places the US has identified as “major money laundering countries.”
In another scheme – referred to in the document as “human head gambling” – patrons who were prohibited by anti-money-laundering laws from gambling would stand behind a proxy gambler and give orders. One such patron had suspected connections to a transnational organized crime group.
Wynn casino’s involvement in the illicit activity wasn’t limited to casino hosts – it also included a company marketing executive and a senior executive of a company affiliate, the agreement says.
In its statement, Wynn said it has since made improvements outlined in its settlement, including adding high-level staff members to an office dedicated to enforcing anti-money-laundering laws, and establishing an independent compliance committee whose members are unaffiliated with the company.
When Zhang and Han pleaded guilty in early 2020, they were the first in the US to be prosecuted for this form of underground banking, according to theDOJ.
Today, networks of Chinese underground bankers are the primary money launderers for not only the Mexican drug cartels, but organized crime groups around the world, including various Italian mafia groups, said Vanda Felbab-Brown, an expert on international organized crime with the Brookings Institution.
“Over the past eight years or so, you have this big explosion of Chinese money laundering in the states, in Mexico, in Europe,” she said.
Wynn isn’t the only casino that has been caught aiding criminals who evade banking laws.
In Australia, Crown Resorts casino was hit with a $300 millionfine(in US dollars) in 2023 for running afoul of anti-money-laundering laws and continuing a business relationship with a junket operator despite the casino’s awareness of allegations the firm was connected toChineseorganized crime. “The company that committed these unacceptable, historic breaches is far removed from the company that exists today,” Crown Resorts said in a statement at the time.
In Canada, where this kind of crime has beenrampant, a 2022reportby a government commission established to look into the issue revealed a common scheme in Vancouver that closely mirrors what investigators say was happening at Wynn: drug traffickers and Chinese loan sharks selling hockey bags filled with cash to Chinese gamblers who would wheel them into casinos to play a card game called baccarat.
Messenger, the gaming-compliance expert, said he wasn’t surprised that the historic Wynn settlement and similar cases haven’t attracted much public interest.
“The general public don’t typically have high expectations when it comes to the casino industry,” he said. “Everyone has Netflix. They’ve seen ‘Casino’; they’ve seen the other movies.”
The casino industry, however, has taken notice, and the culture of compliance with laws to prevent money laundering is improving, he said.
Even so, Messenger said, casinos – with their large volumes of cash and intensifying pressure to boost foot traffic and bring in high-rollers as online gambling gains in popularity – remain a rich venue for rinsing criminal proceeds.
“We see many, many cases of criminal funds or criminals attempting to deposit funds into the casino environment,” he said. “Not for the purposes of entertainment, but for the purposes of creating layers, creating explanations.”
Those criminal funds come from a business that has left a trail of devastation.
DEA official Brian Clark noted that the rise of Chinese money laundering coincided with a drug epidemic that in recent years has claimed over 100,000livesannually in the US – the vast majority from opioids such as fentanyl.
“It’s all being fueled from this money laundering trade,” he said, “and it results in the death of Americans.”"
Big business sits out the Supreme Court fight over Donald Trump’s tariffs,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/big-business-supreme-court-trump-tariffs,"Nov 3, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","It’sone of the most significant economic cases to reach the Supreme Court in years – the blockbuster battle over PresidentDonald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs– butthe nation’s largest companies are sitting on the sidelines.
The battle to stop Trump’s tariffs is being waged bya group of small businesses – including a family-ownedtoymaker in Illinoisand a New York-based wine importer. They have advanced the case to the nation’s highest court even as their larger and better-known competitors have remained notably silent.
The lack of public input from major US companies on the docket of a Supreme Court appeal with potentially vast consequences for their bottom line andthe economy as a whole is unusual and likely based at least in part on a fear of retribution from the White House, multiple people involved with the case and outside experts said.
Trump tariffs decision rests on arguments conservatives repeatedly used against Biden
The Supreme Court hearsarguments Wednesday in the case, which will determine the fate of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs as well as duties he has unilaterally imposed on imports from China, Mexico and Canada.
Trump has made the tariffs, a response to trade imbalances and fentanyl trafficking, the centerpiece of his economic agenda.
“I was shocked that those with much more power and money did not step up,” saidVictor Owen Schwartz, the founder of V.O.S. Selections, the wine and spirits company that is one of the lead plaintiffs in the litigation.“So when I was afforded the opportunity to speak for small American business, I took it.”
Trump has relied on a 1970s-era emergency law to reshape global trade andalliances with allies and adversaries. The law lets a president “regulate importation” during emergencies, but does not specifically mention tariffs. Relying on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trump has rapidly turned some of those tariffs on and off and adjusted rates suddenly to squeeze or ease the pressure during negotiations.
The small businesses suing the administration say the moves are driving costs – and uncertainty – to intolerable levels.
While the president has described the case as an existential one for the country, he has avoided criticizing the companies involved in the litigation directly. Small businesses generally enjoy bipartisan political support and so having lesser-known companies lead the legal charge on tariffs may prove to be a strategic advantage.
Several plaintiffs interviewed by CNN were careful to frame the case as far away from national politics as possible.
“It’s an asphyxiating tax,” said Rick Woldenberg, the CEO of Learning Resources, which makes educational toys and other products and which is also a lead plaintiff.
“I’m not targeting Mr. Trump because I’m not a politician,” he said. “I’m a taxpayer who’s been hit with an unlawful tax.”
The Trump administration has argued the law’s words clearly encompass tariffs, even if the word “tariff” is not explicitly included. And it has warned that a loss would have “catastrophic consequences” for the economy.
“Plaintiffs would unwind trade arrangements worth trillions of dollars, as President Trump has leveraged the IEEPA tariffs into negotiated framework deals with major trading partners – including the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and now China – that address underlying causes of the declared emergencies,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration’s top appellate lawyer, told the Supreme Court in written arguments last week.
Even when they are not named plaintiffs, major companies often wade into Supreme Court cases with friend-of-court briefs, offering their own take on the controversy pending before the justices.
Three years ago, more than 60 major American firms – including General Electric, Procter & Gamble and Intel –signed a brief urging the justicesnot to end affirmative action in college admissions, for instance.
Months later, the courtignored their advice. Today, some of the same companies that signed that brief are facingcriticism in the second Trump administrationfor efforts to expand diversity within their workforces.
In 2019, Apple CEO Tim Cookpersonally signed an amicus briefat the high court supporting the continuation of theDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program created during the Obama administration for Dreamers. Home Depotsigned a brief in 2021in a case on damages suits. Walmartjumped into an appealin 2017 dealing with the credit card industry.
But the big difference today is the administration’s willingness topursue retributionagainst critics. Large companies, including many that have been affected by the tariffs, also avoided weighing in on the cases as they moved through lower federal courts.
“The federal government has immense leverage and immense power and can upend your business with a tweet or a tax investigation,” said Gregory Shaffer, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “I think there’s a sense that companies wanted to be more careful with this administration.”
Friend-of-the-court briefs rarely have sway over the outcome of a case at the Supreme Court, but they can sometimes influence justices in unexpected ways. Last week, an amicus brief from a Georgetown law professor led the court topause a case involving Trump’s use of the National Guardin Illinois and request additional information from both the administration and state officials.
Cassie Abel, founder and CEO of a women’s outdoor apparel company called Wild Rye, agreed that fear of retaliation was probably part of the reason that larger companies haven’t engaged in the tariffs appeal.
Abel, who launched her company in Idaho nearly a decade ago, noted that Walmart and other retailersendured public blowback from Trumpthis year when they threatened tariff-related price increases.
“That was a clear signal that anyone who wants to speak out against this is going to be in the pain cave,” said Abel, who joined an amicus brief with other small businesses opposed to the tariffs.
But larger companies, Abel said, also may not be as immediately affected by tariffs as small ones. Some can switch supply chains or absorb the costs. And, Abel said, some of her largest competitors have pushed back on tariffs – just in quieter ways that don’t involve taking a public position in a high-profile case.
Some, meanwhile, havemanaged to secure exemptionsto mitigate the impact of the tariffs.
Several major companies that have submitted briefs in high-profile cases at the Supreme Court in the past – including Apple, Levi Strauss, Walmart and Home Depot – did not respond to requests for comment.
The briefs that have made their way to the Supreme Court overwhelmingly oppose Trump’s emergency tariffs.
Former national security officials, a group representing the watchmaking industry, nearly three dozen former federal judges, a Virginia-based seller of audio equipment and many other small businesses told the justices they’re opposed to the import taxes. The Chamber of Commerce also filed a brief in favor of unwinding Trump’s tariffs.
It’s also not clear who is funding the litigation. Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at Liberty Justice Center, a group involved in the case, told CNN that it is funded by “individuals and groups that support our mission” but said it doesn’t disclose its donors without their permission.
“There are a lot of calculations going on,” said Gregory Husisian, a trade lawyer who represents large importers for the Foley & Lardner law firm. Large companies, he said, have to think about what legal argument they can raise “that’s not already before the court.”
Without that, he said, “what do you really gain by being the person who sticks your neck out?”"
Trump’s first problem on the economy and health care: admitting he’s got a problem,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/08/politics/trump-economy-health-care-problem-analysis,"Dec 8, 2025, 12:00 AM ET","President Donald Trump has a fresh chance this week to act on a priority voters continually say they want fixed — but over which he’s in denial.
Thehigh and rising pricesof health care, groceries and housing are a leading impediment to the lives of millions of Americans. But Trump, not unusually for presidents, seems more interested in his own political goals and obsessions.
Americans wracked by economic insecurity can’t wait. Nor can Republican lawmakers, who fear the president’s response — which is largely to blame his predecessor Joe Biden — will doom their reelection chances next year.
“Every bill we bring to the floor should be focused on lowering the cost of living for people who need it most,” Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, one of the most at-risk Republicans in the 2026 midterms,told CNN’s “Inside Politics Sunday.”
The Senate is expected to vote as soon as this week on whether to extend expiring subsidies on Affordable Care Act programs as part of last month’s deal to end the government shutdown. If Congress doesn’t act, millionswill face a choicebetween much higher premiums or simply going without coverage.
Trump meanwhile is expected to hold an event in Pennsylvania on making prices more affordable, as his administration faces increasing pressure to demonstrate it understands an issue that was instrumental in his election last year.
The prospects of decisive action this week on either score are low, however.
A plan to address Republican qualms while extending enhanced subsidies without major reforms to Obamacaredoesn’t yet exist. And even if the Senate finds a compromise, there’s little appetite among Republicans in Speaker Mike Johnson’s narrow House majority to save a law they’ve always hated.
Trump fumes even at the word “affordability” — regarding it as a Democratic “hoax” — and is wallowing in denial about an economy that he claims has entered a “golden age” but that is making many working- and middle-class Americans feel poorer. And while Trump has taken some steps totry to lower costs— of certain prescription drugs, for example — his wider policies may be making the situation worse.
The administration tacitly admitted as much when it recentlycut import dutieson coffee, bananas and other staples to ease the pain of consumers.
“As a nation, we have much to be grateful for this holiday season,” Trump said while lighting the National Christmas Tree last week, proclaiming big wins on the border, national security and ending wars. He also said, “Our economy is thriving, inflation has stopped, our nation is strong, and America is back bigger and better, stronger, better than ever before.” This may be one issue where the president’s talent for branding can’t get him out of a political hole.
A CNN/SSRS poll last month found 61% of Americans said Trump’s policies have “worsened economic conditions in this country.” A recent CBS survey found only 36% approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, a onetime strength.
The contradiction between the president’s claims of success and the lived experience of many Americans raises the question of whether Trump, a billionaire, and his wealthy Cabinet have lost touch with what the country is feeling.
The fight over health care is the most urgent and visible clash in the affordability crisis.
If the enhanced subsidies expire at the end of the year, enrollees will face payments that many can’t afford — doubling from $888 to $1,904 next year on average,according to a new pollfrom KFF, a nonpartisan health policy group.
The stark politics of this issue for Republicans explain why Democrats picked the subsidies as the trigger for the government shutdown. They failed to achieve their goal, but highlighted the catch-22 of GOP lawmakers who want to kill Obamacare but whose success would hurt millions of their voters who rely on the program.
Some Republicans are pushing to extend the subsidies, to give them time to draw up a more permanent replacement health care plan. Others want reform before agreeing to an extension. But then the question becomes how to help Americans who suddenly find themselves with premiums they can’t afford.
The conundrum was encapsulated by Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
“Just to extend three years something that has not been working that was meant to be temporary from the beginning is not a good vote,” Curtis told Dana Bash.
“We need a minimum premium for people, even if it’s a couple of bucks. We know we need a cap on income,” he said. “How do we actually lower the cost, not just of insurance, but of health care? And then what do we do in the interim while we’re waiting to do that?”
As Curtis implied, the chances of a workable reform to Obamacare in the few days Congress is in session before the holidays seem remote.
Meanwhile, most people have already been forced to make their health care budget decisions for next year. This is why some Republicans say a vote to extend subsidies is the only answer. “If you don’t have a better plan, then get on board with ours,” Fitzpatrick told CNN’s Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.”
Trump has hardly helped the situation. He has repeatedly failed to lay down a blueprint or to take the complexities of the health insurance market seriously during two presidential terms. He did vaguely suggest that Congress should set up health savings accounts but has put no political muscle behind it. The White House also recentlypulled back a planto extend subsidies amid GOP opposition. Democrats are meanwhile salivating at the prospect of highlighting health care costs in campaign ads they can aim at swing-seat voters next year.
The president is expected to head to Pennsylvania, a state he won in 2024, this week to show solidarity with voters fed up with high prices. But he seems unlikely to ease his political situation, or the economic well-being of working Americans by talking about it. He is resistant to accepting the issue’s political potency. And in the past, he’s struggled to stick to a script and mocked advisers who suggest he needs to show economic empathy.
“They wanted to do a speech on the economy, so we are doing this as an intellectual speech. You are all intellectuals today,” he told a crowd in North Carolina in 2024.
Trump has always been more of a cheerleader than a feel-your-pain president. Yet his transformation of the Republican Party into a populist movement was rooted in his intimate connection with many White, working-class voters who felt deserted — culturally and economically by Democrats. But Trump doesn’t seem ready to commit to any strategy that accepts his second term is not a roaring triumph.
“Our country is wealthy again and secure again,” he said during a Cabinet meeting last week. “There’s this fake narrative that the Democrats talk about affordability. They just say the word, it doesn’t mean anything to anybody, just say, ‘affordability.’” Trump may have a point here, although next year, newly elected Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia must live up to campaign promises to cut prices similar to ones the president made in 2024.
Trump is also correct to say that inflation spiked under Biden. But his claims that he has halted the inflation rate are not true. It recentlyticked up to 2.8%, meaning the rate at which prices are going up is still rising. And an administration that takes pains to court corporations and the oligarchs of the tech industry is yet to convince working Americans it cares as much about them.
Trump’s frequent announcements of billions of dollars in investment in the US by foreign companies and states do look good — even if theydon’t always live upto his billing. And even if such projects come off, they’ll be a long-term proposition and won’t ease prices quickly. Trump’s pledge to appoint anew Federal Reserve chairwho will cut interest rates faster could lower mortgage rates and stimulate the housing market. But it could also unleash a new inflation crisis.
While Trump insists everything is great now, some subordinates, including Vice President JD Vance, who as a potential future GOP presidential candidate must not alienate voters, are more nuanced in recognizing some Americans are hurting. But Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had a sunny prediction on Sunday. “The economy has been better than we thought,” he told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Lashing out at “embedded inflation” left over from the Biden administration, he said: “I think, next year, we’re going to move on to prosperity.”
But voters have heard blame games and optimism before. Successive elections have failed to deliver tangible change. Affordability is a defining issue, that does exist, no matter what Trump says, and it’s become a curse of incumbents."
Vance expected to travel to Pennsylvania next week to continue administration’s push on affordability,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/politics/jd-vance-pennsylvania-trip-affordability,"Dec 10, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Vice President JD Vance is expected to travel to Pennsylvania next week to deliver remarks on the economy and the cost of living, continuing the administration’s newfound push to convince voters that the White House is focused on affordability concerns, a spokesperson said.
Vance will speak at an event next Tuesday near Allentown, Pennsylvania, and he is expected to echo President Donald Trump’s message in a speech that was billed similarly in Mount Pocono, the spokesperson said. In his more than 90-minute remarks to a raucous crowd at a casino, though, Trump frequentlyveered off the affordability script— attacking Democrats and touching on everything from the perils of Scottish windmills to the details of his golf round with Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley.
“President Trump has made enormous strides in reversing the affordability crisis left behind by Democrats. From the historic working families tax cuts to over $18 trillion worth of investment in America, the benefits of the Trump economic agenda have only begun to kick in and there is more work to be done in the new year,” a Vance spokesperson said in announcing the vice president’s upcoming travel. “Expect Vice President Vance to emphasize the fact that making America affordable again is the number one priority of the Trump administration.”
Trump himself is expected tomake more domestic trips in 2026as his team pushes an economic message ahead of the midterms. Though Trump vowed a new era of economic prosperity when he was elected, polls show that a majority of Americans feel he has not yet made good on that promise — and he faces the prospect of an electoral wipeout in next year’s elections if he fails to quickly regain his footing on the economy.
While the Trump administration is expected to make a concerted effort toget the president on the road more frequentlyto try to improve his image on the economy, the vice president is also expected to be a key part of that overall strategy, sources familiar with the discussions said.
Vance has long been viewed as a key messenger for the president, especially on issues that the administration views as being core to their midterm elections plan. Driving home the affordability issue will be a crucial part of his agenda in the new year as well, they said."
Why the world’s richest man and the CEO of the most valuable company met with Saudi officials,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/19/tech/saudi-arabia-us-chips-ai-race,"Nov 19, 2025, 5:23 PM ET","Saudi Arabia is strengthening its ties with American AI companies — announcing a flurry of new joint ventures worth billions of dollars. The country seeks to make its mark in the AI industry as its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, makes his first visit to the United States in years.
Humain —an AI company backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund— announced a series of partnerships with prominent American tech companies, including xAI, Cisco, AMD and Qualcomm, during a US-Saudi investment forum in Washington on Wednesday.
Saudi Arabia is trying to further firm up ties with the United States and shift its economyaway from oil. For American companies, the Middle Eastern country answers three urgentproblems for AI expansion: funding, space and cheap energy.
Saudi Arabia is making a massive bet on becoming a global AI powerhouse
Elon Musk announced at Wednesday’s event that xAI,his AI company, will develop a huge data center in Saudi Arabia alongside Humain. The planned 500-megawatt data center would be xAI’s first large-scale center outside of the United States, and the partnership will see xAI’sGrok chatbotdeployed throughout Saudi Arabia.
“The future of intelligence will be engineered through massive and efficient compute combined with the most advanced AI models,” Musk said in a statement on Wednesday.
The center will be powered by chips from Nvidia, whose founder, Jensen Huang, sat alongside Musk and Saudi Arabian Minister of Communications and Information Technology Abdullah Alswaha at Wednesday’s panel. No further details about the partnership were revealed.
On Middle East tour, Trump touts US tech to power post-oil future
“This is how we walk the talk in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in partnership with the US,” Alswaha said. “Yesterday, the president and his royal highness announced the AI strategic framework and partnership. Today we’re going big with Elon and Jensen, so thank you for those opportunities.”
Bloombergreportedon Wednesday that the United States is set to approve the first sales of advanced AI chips to Humain.
At the event, Alswaha announced a 100-megawatt data center for Amazon Web Services “with a gigawatt ambition” that also will be powered by Nvidia’s infrastructure. AWS said in a statement that it plans “to provide, deploy and manage up to 150,000 AI accelerators” in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.
As AI companies expand, their huge data centers needspaceandmassive energy sources. Many data centers are being built in the United States, includingxAI’s Colossus in Memphis. However, there’s fear that China will beat out the United States when it comes toenergy productionto power AI systems. Saudi Arabia could help with that — it has much easier access to the space and energy needed to power these massive ventures.
Will ‘massive’ Gulf deals cement the US lead in the race for global AI dominance?
The investment from Saudi Arabia also plays a major part in Prince bin Salman’s redemption in the United States, following being labeled a “pariah” byPresident Joe Bidenfor his role in the killing ofWashington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
During his Oval Office visit on Wednesday, Prince bin Salman claimed the country will be investing $1 trillion dollars in the United States, a substantial increase from the previously announced $600 billion investment in May. The comments surprised even President Donald Trump in the moment, although the timeline of the investments is not clear.
“You’re saying to me now that the $600 billion will be $1 trillion?” Trump said to Prince bin Salman in the Oval Office. “Good. I like that very much.”"
Warren Buffett: ‘I’m going quiet’,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/markets/warren-buffett-shareholder-letter,"Nov 10, 2025, 12:52 PM ET","Warren Buffett,in his annual messageas CEO of Berkshire Hathaway to shareholders – a tradition dating back to 1965 – said that he will be “going quiet” after he steps down at the end of this year. But the 95-year-old is not going away just yet.
Buffett will no longer write the message atop the company’s annual report, but he will continue to deliver an annual Thanksgiving message, and he will “step up” his philanthropy, giving away the $149 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock he continues to hold.
“The Oracle of Omaha” has become an investing icon, a billionaire who has cultivated a folksy image, particularly through his letters to shareholders. Although his market moves are closely followed by investors around the world, Buffett has also worked to present himself as a cheerleader for America and ordinary Americans – and for capitalism.
He is being replaced by Greg Abel next year. Abel, 63, is the vice chairman of non-insurance operations of Berkshire and was designated as Buffett’s successor in 2021.
Buffett once again praised his successor, writing that he “has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire’s next CEO.”
Buffettalso gave an update on his health, admitting that to his “surprise, I generally feel good. Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people.”
But the nonagenarian isn’t getting any younger. Acknowledging the limited time he has left and the giant sum of money he wishes to give away, Buffett said he converted 1,800 shares, worth a combined $1.35 billion, into the company’s cheaper “B shares” and delivered them to four of his family’s foundations Monday.
“To improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them, I need to step up the pace of lifetime gifts to their three foundations,” he said.
Buffett says he has high – but realistic – expectations that the conglomerate he led for six decades will continue to thrive after he steps down as CEO. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) shares have risen more than 10% this year, with the company sitting on a $1 trillion market cap.
“In aggregate, Berkshire’s businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems,” he wrote. “However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll.”
Buffett has managed to become a symbol of two seemingly disparate things over his decades in the spotlight: a relentless dealmaker and capitalist, wrapped up in an avuncular figure dispensing practical advice.
Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meetings are like those of no other company, dubbed Woodstock for capitalists, with an exhibit floor showing off many of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway’s businesses.
Indeed, Buffett himself makes a point to appear on the floor and hype up those companies, from eating Dairy Queen ice cream to putting his face and name on limited-edition event merch, all while his security keeps back hordes of shareholding fans trying to take pictures or get a word in with the so-called Oracle of Omaha.
His investing strategy has turned on an incessant search for value, with Berkshire Hathaway often sitting on giant piles of cash until just the right deal comes through. Few other CEOs have earned that level of patience from investors in a market that more often turns on expectations for short-term returns.
Buffett expects the company to move on from him. But so much of Berkshire’s identity has become intertwined with its CEO. It’s hard to imagine the low-profile Greg Abel, for example, puttinghis face on a ketchup bottleto spur sales. Woodstock for capitalists might get just a little less festive from now on.

America is grappling with an air traffic controller shortage. Can AI help?,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/tech/air-traffic-controller-shortage-ai,"Nov 18, 2025, 6:30 AM ET","The longestgovernment shutdownin US history shook travel plans across America earlier this month as a shortage of air traffic controllers resulted in thousands ofdelayed or canceled flights.
But even theend of the shutdowndoesn’t fix the the broaderair traffic controller shortagethat’s been plaguing American flyers for years. Artificial intelligence, with its ability to analyze troves of data and potentially upend industries, might be able to help. After all, some in the field have called AI as impactful on everyday life aselectricityorfire.
While AI does have some practical uses in aviation like crunching data onweather patternsoraircraft trajectories, experts highlighted a range of reasons why the technology won’t be a substitute for air traffic controllers anytime soon – or likely ever.
“It’s a human system, and it’s human-centered for sure because it demands almost near perfect performance,” said Ross Sagun, a former pilot and air traffic controller with more than 50 years of flight experience. “The smallest mistakes can turn into giant disasters.”
Air traffic controllers play a critical role in aviation, guiding jets safely both on the ground and in the air, ensuring safe distances are maintained between aircraft and communicating with pilots – skills that require multitasking, quick decision-making and intense concentration. The Federal Aviation Administration says it handles more than 44,000 flights a day, and 5,500 are in the sky at peak operational times.
Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, described the job as demanding “unique skill and precision” in hiswritten testimonyfor a hearing in March before the US House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Aviation of the Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure. He called air traffic controllers the “backbone” of the National Airspace System, adding that they “require rigorous training, a mastery of complex systems, and the ability to perform under immense pressure.”
That pressure is exactly why the job can’t be outsourced to AI, according to Sagun. Hearing emotion and stress in a pilot or fellow controller’s voice is a key signal that something is wrong and it’s unclear whether AI can detect those cues.
“That’s where you jump in, you scream for help, and we get people over there to take over the situation,” he said.
The rate at which AI is evolving and changing would also make it hard to certify the technology, he added.
There’s little to no margin for error in air traffic control given the safety risks. Even if the technology were to be used for automating the process of guiding aircraft as they land or take off, human workers would still need to manage unforeseen circumstances, according to Amar Gupta, a research scientist with MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
And some research as far back as the early 2000s suggests that type of arrangement, in which a human worker intervenes in the event of an emergency or automation error, may not always be effective. One study from 2005, for example, found that controllers were more likely to detect incidents manually than when using an automated tool that wasn’t 100% reliable.
Air traffic controllers might not be as vigilant if automation were to play a bigger role in their jobs since they wouldn’t be as actively engaged in the environment, according to Michael McCormick, associate professor and program coordinator for air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
“That is the one thing that humans are very poor at doing — that very quickly, you lose vigilance, generally through boredom,” McCormick said.
Experts say there is a place for AI to help with air traffic control, but it would just be to assist with duties rather than replacing jobs.
With many air traffic controllerseither retiring or finding other jobs during the shutdown,such help may be welcome. Air traffic controller staffing has plummeted since 2012, according to data cited by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), and theFederal Aviation Administration’s Air Traffic Controller Workforce Planindicates the number of certified professional controllers fell below targets in 2024.
AI could be useful for helping controllers understand weather patterns, potentially helping to predict the possibility of storms, according to Sagun.
The FAA is working toward an upgraded system that uses AI to help analyze trajectories from aircraft in flight, estimate possible conflicts and provide recommendations to controllers, according to McCormick, though he says it is still years from testing and implementation.
Searidge Technologies, owned by United Kingdom-based air traffic control services provider NATS, has developedan AI systemfor monitoring ground movements and facilitating communication with pilots.
The technology is being used at London’s Heathrow Airport to track aircraft exiting the runway and Florida’s Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to monitor gate occupancy.
The company says on its website that the technology isn’t a replacement for human control. It’s seeing “strong global interest” in its system and expects more “operational rollout and demonstration sites in the coming year,” Ron Reddick, vice president of global sales for Searidge Technologies, said in an emailed statement to CNN.
But don’t expect major upgrades to happen overnight in the United States.
Implementing new technologies into air traffic control requires rigorous testing and is a lengthy ordeal, backedby infrastructure designed to last for decades. The Department of Transportation plans to upgrade the FAA’s air traffic control system by 2028 with “all new hardware” and “all new software,” Secretary Sean Duffysaid in May. But those upgrades are now going to take longer than initially planned, Duffyrecently told reportersat a press conference.
“The entire process takes years,” said McCormick when asked how long it would take to implement AI in current air traffic control systems. “We’re in initial stages. We’re not far down the road.”"
‘Things are pretty crappy.’ 1 in 4 US households are living paycheck to paycheck,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/13/economy/job-prices-debt-economy,"Nov 13, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Austin H. can’t wait to buy a house and start a family. But right now, the 34-year-old is barely getting by.
Austin is living paycheck to paycheck and saving almost no money, one of the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet in an increasingly unaffordable economy.
Worse, the family-owned construction business he works at is shutting down.
“I am going to be unemployed in the next month or two – with no safety net,” said Austin, who declined to share his last name.
An estimated 24% of US households are living paycheck to paycheck so far in 2025, according to a Bank of America Institute analysis released this week. The bank’s researchers combed through internal data on its tens of millions of consumers and tracked how much income customers spent on necessities like housing, gasoline, groceries, child care and utilities.
They found that 24% of households spend over 95% of their income on those necessities, leaving little to nothing left over for the “nice-to-have” things like going out to dinner or taking a vacation, let alone saving.
Austin, who has a master’s degree in fine arts, said he’s applied to roughly 1,000 jobs over the past year – everything from teaching to construction – with no luck.
“To be 34 and living paycheck to paycheck with no savings, things are pretty crappy right now,” he said.
Austin is supporting his partner, a veterinary student, and worries about how the two of them will pay off his student debt on top of all their other expenses.
“We want to own a house and start a family, but I don’t know how we will ever get our feet under ourselves,” he said.
The Bank of America report is evidence of the K-shaped economy, where affluent Americans are faring far better than those at the bottom.
Many are struggling to get by, even as President Donald Trumpdismisses affordability concernsas a “con job” conjured up by Democrats based on “fake” polls.
But the rate of increase in households living paycheck to paycheck has slowed significantly this year, and while there is little change this year for middle- and high-income households, the share of lower-income households living paycheck to paycheck has jumped from 27% in 2023 to 29%, according to Bank of America.
“Higher income and lower income households are living in two different worlds,” Joe Wadford, economist at the Bank of America Institute, told CNN.
The problem is that paychecks among lower-income households are often not keeping up with prices – especially now thatinflation has reaccelerated.
After-tax wages increased about 2% in October year over year among middle-income consumers, Bank of America found. That’s below the 3% inflation rate as of September.
Wage growth for lower-income Americans is falling even further behind. Their after-tax wages increased just 1% year-over-year.
By contrast, high-income wages jumped 4%, safely outpacing the increase in the cost of living.
Wadford said the wage growth gap between high- and low-income Americans hasn’t been this high since 2016.
For Millennials like Austin, that gap is even bigger.
Wages have inched up just 1% for low-income Millennials, compared with 6% for high-income.
“We work full-time and have degrees. And we’re getting nowhere,” Austin said.
Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, said the large number of households living paycheck to paycheck underscores the “deepening affordability crisis” caused by five years of price hikes that have outpaced income gains.
For the broader economy, the risk is that many families struggling to get by and worried about their jobs opt to spend much more cautiously.
“This could weaken the foundation of a consumer-driven economy,” Daco said.
That’s especially true if layoffs gather steam in what had been a no-fire, no-hire job market.
Goldman Sachs economists warned in a recent research report of a growing “risk of labor market deterioration.” The Wall Street bank estimates there is a 20% to 25% chance that the US unemployment rate jumps by at least 0.5 percentage points in the next six months. That’s up from just a 10% chance as of six months ago.
Some Americans are falling behind on their bills – especially those with low credit scores.
The percentage of subprime borrowers who are at least60 days late on their car loansclimbed to 6.65% in October, according to Fitch Ratings.
That is the highest since Fitch tracking began in the early 1990s, surpassing the prior peak set in January and well above levels during the Great Financial Crisis.
This trend is a clear sign of financial distress, especially since car loans are historically the last payment Americans are willing to miss.
Bank of America has found that the number of households making just the minimum payment on their credit card is also rising, though so is the share of credit card users paying off their entire balance each month.
“There is a mixed bag. There are some signs of consumer health, and yet, within the minority of people experiencing financial stress, pressure is mounting,” said Wadford, the Bank of America economist.
Vanessa Jones, a 65-year-old grandmother living in Davenport, Iowa, took on a second nursing job two years ago because she couldn’t make ends meet.
“The cost of living is way too high. My savings have been depleted. I haven’t tapped into my retirement, but that looks like the next step,” she said.
Jones, the primary caregiver for her two grandchildren, was recently diagnosed with cancer and wound up with “astronomical” medical bills. Facing $85,000 in medical debt, she filed for bankruptcy.
Jones pushed back on politicians arguing there is no affordability crisis.
“The people claiming prices are lower are not actually buying their own groceries or trying to find the cheapest place to get their car fixed,” she said. “They need to walk in our shoes.”"

Investigators race to find the cause of botulism contamination in ByHeart infant formula,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/health/infant-formula-recall-botulism-investigation,"Nov 25, 2025, 8:00 AM ET","Rose Dexter was just a month old in August when she developed constipation, gas and tummy discomfort, symptoms that her pediatrician chalked up to normal baby development.
“Looking back at the photos, she was losing weight. She looked sick,” said her dad, Stephen Dexter. “And the entire time during the decline, Mom had been saying something was wrong.”
That something turned out to be infant botulism, a condition caused by the spores of a bacteria that was growing in her gut, producing a toxin considered to be the most powerful in the world. It was poisoning her nerves and gradually paralyzing her.
Rose is one of at least 37 infants who have developed botulism after consuming powdered formula from the company ByHeart.
The California Department of Health conducted tests of an opened can of formula that had been fed to an infant, and those tests found Clostridium botulinum, the bacteria that makes the toxin, spurring a nationwide recall of certain batches. Days later,the recall expandedto all ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula cans and Anywhere Pack products.
Last week, an independent company hired by the manufacturer alsofound the bacteriain five of 36 samples across three lots of unopened cans of formula.
“Based on these results, we cannot rule out the risk that all ByHeart formula across all product lots may have been contaminated,” the company said Monday.
The number of illnesses in this outbreak may rise as officials reopen investigations into cases of infant botulism from earlier in the year.
Already, it is “certainly the largest foodborne illness outbreak that I’ve heard of in 32 years due to infant formula,” said attorney Bill Marler, who specializes in litigating food poisoning cases and is representing the Dexters and two other families in lawsuits against ByHeart. “This outbreak has me very worried.”
Dr. Steve Abrams, a neonatologist and expert on pediatric nutrition at the University of Texas at Austin, says he also doesn’t remember ever seeing this many patients sickened by baby formula.
“This is an insane level of patients, babies affected. I think you’d have to go back very far to find this many babies affected by a disease state from contaminated formula,” he said.
Despite growing numbers of illnesses, he’s worried that people aren’t aware of the recall or the severity of the outbreak.
“We have these disturbing reports of 10 days after the recall, people are going into stores and still find cans of ByHeart,” Abrams said last week. “This recall is testing some real untested waters that we haven’t seen before.”
ByHeart would not comment on pending litigation, but the company saidin a statementthat it is “doing everything we can to ensure this investigation reveals solutions and aids in understanding cases of infant botulism broadly. That’s what parents, the medical community, and you deserve.”
Although ByHeart said November 11 that it had recalled all its infant formula, the FDAsaid last weekthat it has received reports that some of the product is still on store shelves in multiple states, including at major chain stores like Wal-Mart, Target, Kroger and Sprouts. It has also been sold through online marketplaces, including to some customers overseas.
“Consumers worldwide should not use any ByHeart brand infant formula as all ByHeart products are included in this recall,” the FDA said.
Marler said that it’s a retailer’s responsibility to remove recalled product from the shelves and that it’s not clear why the word hasn’t gotten out to all stores.
It’s also not clear how the formula – which is made with organic whole milk from grass-fed cows and advertises itself to health-conscious consumers as a “patented protein blend that’s as close to human breast milk as possible” – became contaminated.
OnMonday, ByHeart said it’s working to find a root source of the cases “through a rigorous audit of every step of our product development chain, from suppliers and raw ingredients, through to packaging and transportation. This includes testing more product samples.”
Botulinum is a unique problem in food poisoning. Adults get sick from ingesting the toxin that’s made by the bacteria, often by eating improperly canned food. Babies, whose guts aren’t yet fully developed, fall ill after ingesting the spores of the bacteria, which then colonize their guts and begin producing the toxin.
“If you think about seeds, like plant seeds, spores are like the same version, only produced by bacteria,” said Dr. Kristin Schill, a food microbiologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Food Research Institute. “They package their DNA and kind of like a protein shell, like a seed, that prevents them from being killed in harsh environments.”
Spores can survive pasteurization, the heat treatment that destroys other types of pathogens in milk.
ByHeart formula uses whole milk powder as an ingredient, as well as whey and other dairy ingredients.
“Any of those ingredients really could be a source of spores. There could be an accumulation of spores on the equipment, I don’t know,” said Schill, who previously worked as a research microbiologist for the US Food and Drug Administration.
Schill said botulinum spores have been found in milk powder in the past, though at very low concentrations.A caseof infant botulism linked to powdered infant formula was published in a medical journal in 2005.
It will be critical to find out how high the concentrations of spores are in the formula that’s been tested, Schill said, and those levels may help point investigators in the right direction.
Stephen Dexter said he bought the first can of ByHeart formula for Rose after they got home from the hospital and his wife, Yurany, had trouble making enough breast milk.
“It was kind of a desperate move,” he said. He wasn’t sure what to get and went to a natural grocery chain, “assuming they would have some alternative selections.”
He looked for the most expensive formula, figuring that would be higher quality. ByHeart sells for about $40 a can. “It said all the things I was looking for. It said all the things that I thought I would not want, as it had a bunch of ‘no’s’ on there, which seemed good to me, and so I purchased that,” he said.
Rose did well on the formula, Dexter said, until she didn’t.
After a few weeks of subtle changes, he tried to wake Rose one day for a normal feeding, but she wouldn’t wake up. It was “the moment of ‘Oh, we gotta go.’ … That’s when we took her to the to the emergency room.”
“She couldn’t move her arms or her legs,” Yurany Dexter said. The doctors tried to gently lift Rose’s head and shoulders to see whether she could hold them up, and she couldn’t.
They did blood tests and then used a needle to collect the clear fluid that surrounds the spinal cord and the brain. Doctors told the baby’s parents that they suspected muscular dystrophy or botulism.
Infant botulism “happens a little bit from the top of your head down. So you first might notice droopy eyelids or some parents notice, like, their infant’s expressions are not as expressive,” said Dr. Erica Pan, a pediatrician who is the state public health officer with the California Department of Health. “It’s a slow progression.”
That makes the early symptoms hard to spot. Each year in the United States, fewer than 200 infants develop this type of botulism, and as long as they are diagnosed in time — the condition can be fatal if it paralyzes their lungs — the cases all eventually come to the California Department of Public Health, which has an Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program.
The program is the legacy of Dr. Stephen Arnon, chief of the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program at the California health department, who dedicated his life to finding a treatment for infantile botulism.
That treatment is called BabyBIG, for botulism immune globulin. It’s made from the plasma – the clear part of the blood – of donors who’ve been vaccinated against botulism. It’s the only treatment available in the world for the condition.
It’s also an orphan drug, meaning it’s not profitable for pharmaceutical companies to make. The process is expensive and there’s not a large market for it. So the California Department of Public Health makes it.
It’s still very expensive, costing nearly $70,000 per treatment. But it’s so effective that it cuts the time a baby may have to spend in the hospital by an average of three and a half weeks, meaning it easily saves more money than it costs.
The California health department says it has treated nearly 2,200 infants with BabyBIG since it was approved by the FDA in 2003. From August 1 through November 19, it said 107 infants nationwide have received BabyBIG treatment.
The doctors gave Rose a dose of BabyBIG partly on faith: They didn’t have confirmation that she had botulism when they treated her. But soon after she got it, her condition began to improve. Stool testing finally confirmed botulism just a few weeks ago.
The California infant botulism program does a thorough case investigation for each patient. They ask about exposure to dust or honey, which can be another source of the spores. They also ask about what formula the child uses.
“Often, we just don’t find a source,” Pan said.
Starting in August, Pan said, the agency began to get more calls than usual to the infant botulism hotline. In taking the case histories, they learned that about half the babies were formula-fed, and about half of those had consumed ByHeart.  That was a red flag since ByHeart accounts for only about 1% of all formula sales nationwide.
“It’s a much, much higher proportion than you would expect, and that’s what raised the alert,” she added.
The state contacted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to its findingsand issued a nationwide alertNovember 8, when just two specific lots of the formula were recalled.
The Dexters had no idea that the formula they were feeding their daughter might have been the source of her illness. They continued to give it to her even after she got home from the hospital.
Then they got a call asking whether they’d fed Rose from either of two specific lots of the ByHeart formula. Stephen, who repairs pianos for a living, had kept all the cans to store the parts he uses. “None of my numbers match the recalled numbers,” he said, but they stopped giving the formula to Rose. Additional products were recalled on November 11.
After weeks of panic and worry about their daughter, they were relieved she was back home and getting better. But the recall has stirred all those emotions up again.
“I feel like it was a nightmare, all the things that happened for us,” said Yurany, who still regrets that she wasn’t able to breastfeed.
“You just keep getting more and more angry, just kind of reflecting and going, how did this happen?” Stephen said.
Rose is recovering. She continues to see a gastroenterologist every few months to make sure her gut is healing.
For now, investigators are racing to find the exact cause of the infections before more babies get sick.
“I hope we can find the source of the outbreak to prevent future infant botulism outbreaks,” Schill said. “It is heartbreaking that such a vulnerable population can be subjected to a horrible disease.”"

Trump greenlights exports of Nvidia H200 chips to China,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/08/tech/nvidia-h200-chips-china-trump-export,"Dec 8, 2025, 6:31 PM ET","President Donald Trump on Monday announced he’s removing export controls on Nvidia’s H200 chips to China, a key reversal in what’s become part of a broader trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
H200s – the second most-powerful AI chip in Nvidia’s inventory – are vital for completing tasks performed by AI.﻿
Nvidia’s highly sought-after Blackwell chips and next-generation Rubin chips are not part of the deal, Trump wrote.
“I have informed President Xi, of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security. President Xi responded positively!” Trump wrote in the post.
Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company and the leading chipmaker, has seen massive success as demand for AI has boomed in recent years. But that success has also dropped it square in the middle of global tensions over who will win a global race to dominate artificial intelligence.
In his post, Trump added: “25% will be paid to the United States of America,” possibly implying 25% of the revenue Nvidia earns from the sales will go to the American government.
The news comes after Trump met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last week. Trump has repeatedly said that the United States must win the global AI race, even as China has invested heavily in its own domestic industry.
“We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.
Trump also said the Department of Commerce is finalizing a similar approach for AMD, Intel and other American chip companies.
“AMD commends President Trump’s leadership in finding a thoughtful approach to export policies that allows for US companies to compete globally,” an AMD spokesperson told CNN. “The President’s decision strengthens American competitiveness, supports high-value domestic jobs, and drives American investment and growth in the semiconductor industry.”
Intel did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
The decision comes after Trump has struck arrangements with chipmakers earlier this year, including an agreement with Nvidia and AMD topay the US government15% of revenues from chip sales to China. Trump also announced in August that the government would takea 10% stake in Intel."
ByHeart recalls all of its baby formula in the US amid infant botulism outbreak investigation,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/11/health/byheart-baby-formula-recall-wellness,"Nov 11, 2025, 6:32 PM ET","The baby formula companyByHeart said Tuesdaythat it has recalled all of its infant formula products nationwide, including cans and single-serve sticks.
The US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating amultistate outbreak of infant botulismthat may be tied to ByHeart’s “whole nutrition” infant formula products.
Epidemiologic and laboratory data has shown that ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula might be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, the germ that causes botulism, the FDA said Tuesday.
Preliminary tests find germ that causes botulism in ByHeart baby formula
According to the FDA, as of Monday, 15 children with suspected or confirmed infant botulism who had also been exposed to ByHeart infant formula have beenreported in 12 states: Arizona, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.
All 15 infants, who ranged in age from 16 days to 157 days, were hospitalized and givenBabyBIG, an intravenous antibody treatment for infant botulism. No deaths have been reported.
Infant botulism happens when a baby swallows Clostridium botulinumspores, which can grow in the gut and produce botulinum neurotoxin,according to the CDC. Signs and symptoms – which can take several weeks to develop – may include constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, difficulty swallowing and a weak and altered cry, which can progress to difficulty breathing and respiratory arrest.
What is botulism, and how does it kill?
Since August, 84 infants have received treatment for infant botulism nationwide, based on data from the California Department of Public Health’s Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, according to the FDA. Among those infants, 43% had been exposed to powdered infant formula. And among those who had powdered infant formula exposure, more than 40% consumed ByHeart Whole Nutrition formula.
“This information shows that ByHeart brand formula is disproportionately represented among sick infants in this outbreak, especially given that ByHeart represents an estimated 1% of all infant formula sales in the United States,” according to theFDA. “Investigations remain ongoing but have not identified any other infant formula brands or shared exposures that pose a risk to infants.”
Mia Funt and Ron Belldegrun, the co-founders of ByHeart,said in an online letterTuesday that they have provided the FDA with access to all of their facilities and products.
“Upon learning about this outbreak on Friday evening, we immediately began conducting our own extensive testing on all ByHeart batches. Additionally, we are providing the FDA complete and unrestricted access to all of our facilities and products for their investigation, which has been done regularly at our owned facilities. We will share the results of our own testing as they become available,” Funt and Belldegrun wrote.
“At this moment, the most important thing for you to know is that all ByHeart product must be discarded. We know that switching formulas is not an easy process or decision. We have resources to help,” they said, providing a link to a guide onhow to switch infant formulas. “We are so sorry, and are committed to doing anything we can to support you.”
Infant botulism in 10 US states linked to formula being recalled
Several states are testing leftover formula, the FDA said, and the results are expected in the coming weeks.
Preliminary lab resultsthat the California Department of Public Health released Saturday suggested that the bacterium that causes botulism was present in an open can of ByHeart infant formula, which was fed to an infant with botulism.
“Infant botulism is a very rare disease that occurs when babies inhale or swallow spores of the toxin-producing bacteria that cause infant botulism, which leads to progressive muscle weakness including trouble breathing if not treated in time,” Dr. Erica Pan, California Department of Public Health’s director and state public health officer,said in a news releaseSaturday.
“We have tested a sample of the specific powdered infant formula linked with these cases and preliminary tests are positive,” Pan said. “We are urging parents to stop using ByHeart formula immediately.”​
The FDA said no unopened ByHeart product has tested positive for Clostridium botulinum spores or toxin."
How America’s biggest retailers are preparing for an unpredictable holiday season,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/26/business/shopping-stores-holiday-preparation-christmas,"Nov 26, 2025, 6:01 AM ET","America’s biggest stores are taking big swings this holiday season, trying to stand out and attract cautious consumers. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, sticky inflation and rising unemployment are prompting Americans to be more careful with their holiday spending.
Wells Fargo projects this year’s holiday sales will rise between 3.5% and 4% from last year. But that doesn’t account for higher prices due to inflation, so actual spending could be flat.
“This year is really back to basics and leveraging strong merchandising, strong discounting, and making sure that (retailers are) getting their customers in the door this holiday,” Wells Fargo retail analyst Lauren Murphy told CNN.
The legacy department store Macy’s is revamping the in-store experience to win over wary shoppers. Budget-friendly Old Navy is leveraging its couture-designer-turned-chief-creative-officer Zac Posen. And even the world’s largest retailer, Walmart, is promising a 30-minute turnaround from online order to the delivery truck.
Executives at all three companies told CNN that, regardless of  higher prices, they’re working to help customers stretch their dollars and get more for their money.
Macy’s is going back to its roots; hoping to transport customers to the days of glitzy department stores.
In its New York City flagship store, a half-dozen partnershipsare waiting for customers, including an NBA Experience and exclusive Disney collaboration. The store itself is decked out with holiday lights and decorations, boasting an indoor holiday market, DJ and new brands on display.
Macy’s iconic Thanksgiving Day Parade Santa, who usually arrives at the end of the parade to kick off the holiday season, is even going on his first ever tour to different stores around the country.
“What we’ve seen around the customer is they’re much more choiceful,” Macy’s chief merchandising officer, Nata Dvir, told CNN. “I think there’s so many places for them to shop, so (we are) really making sure that it’s coupled not only with great product, but having the quality and the value and the experience that comes with it.”
It’s a purposeful bet, putting to the test a multiyear initiative to attract customers and revamp Macy’s remaining locations. The mid-range department store has fended offactivist investorsamid slumping sales. Last year, Macy’sannounced it was closing 150 underperforming storesby 2026 while investing customer service and inventory in its remaining 350 locations.
The plan seemed to be working. Macy’s recently posted its first sales growth in three years. But like all retailers, it now has to grapple with tariffs.
The chain plans for the holidays nearly a year in advance, sourcing items from more than 25 countries. Macy’s worked with vendors to keep prices low in as many categories as possible. But still, some increases will happen for products like toys and sweaters, Dvir said.
“While we saw the tariffs coming towards us, what we tried to do was really offset what that cost (was) by putting more into the product,” she told CNN.
That means investing in elevated fabrics, like cashmere, so customers will hopefully think the quality is worth the cost.
As the holiday season marches on, Macy’s is using its own economists to help translate what the latest economic data will mean for customers. That way, Macy’s can pivot on assortment and pricing.
“It is a science, but there’s a little art that goes into it as well,” Dvir said.
Millions of units. Twenty-two designs. $5 pajama pants.
If the holiday season is Old Navy’s “Super Bowl,” as CEO Horacio Barbeito described it, its family pajamas are its winning touchdown. The seasonal jammies is a multimillion dollar business and one of the company’s biggest eventsin terms of sales volume.
But Old Navy, with stores in 49 out of 50 states, will need more than festive pajamas to reach cost-burdened consumers this holiday season. So, it’s also betting on its first designer collection with Anna Sui and new styles conceived by one of America’s best-known couture fashion designers, Zac Posen – now, Old Navy’s chief creative officer.
“This was the opportunity of a lifetime. This is the brand that dresses America,” Posen told CNN inside Old Navy’s Times Square location. Posen pointed out the specific features he crafted for the clothing on the shelves, such as bow-tie shoulder straps and pockets on a taffeta holiday dress.
Old Navy is an essential part of parent Gap Inc. The company reported better-than-expected earnings in its third quarter, with a 5% year-over-year revenue rise for Old Navy alone.
But customers are being careful with spending, and tariffs still loom over Old Navy’s merchandise. The retailer has introduced RFID technology that allows associates to know what’s in stock and locate it in stores, helping to find products quickly and keep customers from walking out of the store and losing a sale.
“In our industry, it’s a game changer,” Barbeito said.
The CEO insists Old Navy’s focus on value means it will “not participate” in the swirling uncertainty in the economy. Posen said the brand will persevere no matter what’s issues it faces.
“Every year has its challenges. Sometimes it’s the economy, sometimes it’s the weather, sometimes it’s a change of an administration,” Posen said. “At the end of the day people want to look good, they want to feel good, and that line continues and I think when things can be more challenging, we rise to the occasion.”
In Greencastle, Pennsylvania, sits a 1.5 million square foot fulfillment center where machines do most of the processing and packaging of online order.
AI-powered machines make custom boxes for each order, sort the product and tapes the box shut. Associateswork with the machines surrounded by the quiet hum of automation.
One of four so-called NexGen fulfillment centers across the country, this brand new facility is part of Walmart’s plans to win customers this holiday season by being the speediest. America’s largest retailer said the center can process 100,000 packages a day.
“When you click buy, we can actually get it out of the internet onto a trailer going to your house within 30 minutes,” Barat Smith, vice president of operations for Walmart’s US su﻿pply chain, told CNN.
Walmart is heading into this holiday season with a head start thanks to its strong earnings. Revenue rose 5.8% in the most recent quarter, with a 27% hike in e-commerce alone. As prices have risen since the Covid-19 pandemic, Walmart has attracted more middle- to higher-income shoppers looking for a bargain.
But Walmart faces obvious competition in the realm of online shopping this holiday season – juggernaut Amazon as well as affordable Chinese drop-shippers like Temu and Shein.
“We focus on operating at everyday low cost so that we can deliver everyday low prices on a consistent basis,” David Guggina, Walmart’sexecutive vice president and chief e-commerce officer, told CNN. “In this respect, we’re talking about speed. If we create a great customer experience that drives more orders, and more orders drives density, and density allows us to lower our cost to operate.”
These fulfillment centers are twice as productive as Walmart’s older facilities and move half of all the company’s volume.
Walmart associates interact with packages just five times compared to the legacy fulfillment centers, which have 12 employee steps.
“And some of our other facilities, we can walk up to 10 miles a day for our associates. Now the furthest they walk is from their car into their workstation,” Smith said."
"Corporate America ‘risks rolling back progress’ for women, says new report",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/business/gender-parity-leadership-corporate-america,"Dec 9, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Large US companies have made progress – albeit slowly – over the past decade when it comes to increasing the number of women in management and leadership roles on every rung of the corporate ladder.
But reported changes in company priorities this year coupled with employees’ reported experiences suggest those modest but steady gains may be at risk.
That’s one takeaway from the latest annual report on the state of women at work from consulting firm McKinsey & Company and Lean In, a women-at-work advocacy group.
“For the 11th consecutive year, women remain underrepresented at every level of the corporate pipeline,” thereportnotes. “[A]nd company commitment to their advancement appears to be declining.”
For instance, for the first time, the researchers asked companies about their commitment to “women’s career advancement.” A small majority (54%) said they placed a high priority on it, and less than a majority (46%) said the same for the advancement of women of color. Another 21%, meanwhile, said they give little to no priority to advancing women. In addition, companies’ stated commitment to the broader idea of “gender diversity” has been declining since it hit a high of 88% in 2017.
The report also notes that some companies said they have scaled back programs like remote work, formal sponsorship and targeted career development, all of which have proven beneficial to women.
“In a year when corporate America is rolling back their commitment to women’s careers and women saying they’re feeling it, it feels like we’re at risk of backsliding after a decade of hard-earned, measurable progress,” said Rachel Thomas, cofounder and CEO of Lean In.
The analysis is based on three sets of data: Talent pipeline information from 2024 (eg, hiring and promotions) provided by 124 companies employing roughly 3 million people; a non-statistically representative survey done this year of chief human resource officers plus follow-up interviews with 62 of them; and a non-statistically representative third-party survey of more than 9,500 full-time employees who work for large, for-profit companies in the United States and Canada.
It’s hard to narrow the gender gap in managerial and leadership roles when women are promoted less than men at all levels of a company and also are less likely to have sponsors who support them.
For every 100 men who got a promotion, only 93 women did, the research showed. While that is better than the 81 recorded in last year’s report, the authors note,“the 2025 data may paint a rosier picture than reality: the companies that shared their pipeline information this year have a higher representation of women compared to typical companies [that participated in the study]from 2021 to 2024.”
The Trump administration has a new way to pressure companies to ditch DEI
As for sponsors, 66% of senior-level women surveyed said they had sponsors versus 72% of men. The gap was narrowest for mid-level employees (51% of women vs. 54% of men). And it was widest among entry-level employees (31% of women vs 45% of men).
“[T]his really matters. Employees with sponsors are promoted at nearly twice the rate of those without. … This mirrors external research showing that sponsorship accelerates advancement— particularly for early-career employees,” the report noted.
And relatedly, senior-level men were 70% more likely than women to say they’d been offered a chance to participate in leadership or career training.
The so-called “flexibility stigma” – an assumption that those working from home aren’t as committed to their jobs as in-office employees – appears to disproportionately penalize women.
For example, the study found that among women who work on-site three or more days a week, 54% had a sponsor and 53% got a promotion in the past two years. Those rates both drop to 37% for women who work remotely the majority of the week.
But for men, there is not nearly as big a drop in opportunity. Their sponsorship and promotion rates when they work primarily on site were 57% and 54%, respectively. When they work remotely a majority of weekdays those rates only drop to 52% and 49%.
Translation: When it comes to remote work, “There is an extra penalty [for women] that men don’t face. It’s pronounced. [They are] uniquely getting penalized when they choose it,” said Alexis Krivkovich, a senior partner at McKinsey.
Women and men surveyed both expressed high commitment to their careers and motivation to do their best work. “But there is a notable gap in desire to advance this year,” the authors wrote.
Overall, 80% of women surveyedsaid they want to be promoted to the next level, compared to 86% of men. The gap is wider for those in entry-level and senior level positions.
Several factors may be at play, including lack of career support. “When women and men have sponsors and receive similar levels of support from managers and more senior colleagues, they are equally enthusiastic about getting promoted to the next level,” according to the study.
Promotion disparity from the jump may be another factor. Women in entry-level jobs only hold a third of the entry-level people manager roles.
And family obligations may weigh heavily. “Women continue to shoulder more responsibilities at home,” the authors wrote. “Almost 25 percent of entry- and senior-level women who are not interested in promotion say that personal obligations make it hard to take on additional work – versus just 15 percent of comparable men.”"
Millions of Republicans on Obamacare want enhanced subsidies extended. Most Hill Republicans don’t,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/politics/obamacare-trump-subsidies-poll,"Dec 4, 2025, 5:01 AM ET","GOP lawmakers aredeeply dividedover whether to extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, but millions of Republicans enrolled in Obamacare plans have a clear message for them — don’t let the beefed-up subsidies lapse.
Some 72% of Republican enrollees — and the same share of MAGA supporters with Obamacare coverage — favor extending the more generous assistance, which is set to lapse at year’s end, according to anew pollfrom KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. The same is true of 95% of Democratic enrollees and 84% of independents.
The Senate is expected to vote as early as next week on the fate of ACA, as part of a deal Democrats cut to reopen the government. But Republicanshaven’t been able to agreeon their own plan to put on the floor, and the White House recently withdrew a proposal to extend the subsidies amid GOP opposition.
Obamacare enrollees: Worried about losing the enhanced subsidies? Share your story
If theextra subsidies expire, the premiums enrollees pay will more than double, from $888 to $1,904,on average, next year, KFF found. That will forcemany folksto consider whether they can find the funds to afford the policies, become uninsured or take other steps.
Although Obamacare has historically not been very popular among the GOP, more than 9 million Republicans and Republican-leaning independents depend on it for their health insurance this year, according to KFF. They account for nearly 40% of enrollees this year.
The enhanced subsidies, which were enacted by the Biden administration in 2021, have made coverage more affordable — enabling low-income Americans to pay nothing or nearly nothing in premiums and opening up assistance to the middle class for the first time. The aid helped draw a record 24 million people to sign up for policies this year.
Much of the growth since the beefed-up subsidies were approved has been concentrated in red states, particularly in the South. Sign ups tripled in Texas, Mississippi, West Virginia, Louisiana, Georgia and Tennessee, according to KFF. Nearly six in 10 enrollees live in congressional districts represented by a Republican.
And in some of those districts, the margin of victory in last year’s House election was narrower than the number of enrollees who live in them, said Cynthia Cox, KFF’s director of the Program on the ACA.
Soaring health care costs would affect many enrollees’ votes in next year’s midterm election, the poll found. If their overall health care expenses (including premiums, deductibles and co-pays) rise by $1,000 next year, just over half said it would have a “major impact” on their decision to vote or the candidate they’d support.
About 37% said President Donald Trump would deserve most of the blame for the jump, and 33% said congressional Republicans. Some 29% would pin most of the blame on congressional Democrats.
Belinda Hernandez is one Republican who told CNN that she would not have voted for Trump and the Republican ticket last year had she known they would not support extending the enhanced subsidies that she depends on.
The Texas resident and her husband own a barber shop and pay about $215 a month for their coverage. A few weeks ago, they received a letter from their insurer that said their monthly premium would skyrocket to more than $700, which would be impossible for them to afford.
But after looking on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, she learned she would still qualify for Obamacare’s original subsidies, which would bring her monthly rate down to $354.
“It’s more money to pay with the same income, which means I’ll have to budget more than before,” said Hernandez, 46, noting that she is already struggling with the high cost of groceries and other necessities. “How much more can a family cut back when finances are already so tight? But we need insurance for peace of mind if we were to fall ill or end up in the hospital.”
Even some conservative Republicans who are not enamored with their Affordable Care Act coverage say the enhanced subsidies should be extended, at least for some enrollees.
Restaurant entrepreneur Francesco Casola was happier with the health insurance he had before Obamacare but has remained on the exchange because it’s the best coverage he can get for the money. The New Jersey resident’s premium is set to jump from $1,500 for himself and two of his children to nearly $2,000 next year, which will force him to “juggle” to afford it.
Still, he doesn’t think that middle class Americans like himself should get government assistance — a view shared by some Republicans and Democrats, who have released proposals to extend the enhanced subsidies with income limits. He would cut off aid to those who make more than $150,000 a year.
But Casola thinks those lower down on the income ladder should continue to receive the enhanced subsidies.
“I don’t want anyone to get sick and not have help,” said Casola, 59. “That’s inhumane.”
The health care struggle is sharpening this fundamental tension in the GOP
Much of the growth in enrollment since the enhanced subsidies were enacted has been among those who are barely making ends meet, Cox said.
The KFF poll found that 58% said they could not afford an annual premium hike of $300 without significantly disrupting their household finances. If their premiums doubled, a quarter of enrollees said they would be very likely to go without health insurance, while 15% said they would be very likely to look for a different job that provides coverage. Nearly a third said they would very likely look for a different Obamacare plan that has a lower premium but may have higher deductibles and copays.
While there is still time for Congress to extend the more generous subsidies, more than half of those surveyed told KFF they would make their decisions about 2026 coverage before December. That means some enrollees may have already opted to become uninsured.
“Once you lose someone because they’ve decided that it’s unaffordable for them, it’s hard to convince them to come back, even if the situation changes,” Cox said."
China’s censorship and surveillance were already intense. AI is turbocharging those systems,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/china/china-ai-censorship-surveillance-report-intl-hnk,"Dec 4, 2025, 1:39 AM ET","China’s ruling Communist Party is using artificial intelligence to turbocharge the surveillance and control of its 1.4 billion citizens, with the technology reaching further into daily life, predicting public demonstrations and monitoring the moods of prison inmates, according toa new report.
Many of these systems are already well-documented – from the country’s army of online censors maintaining its Great Firewall, to the surveillance cameras ubiquitous on almost every street and block across urban China.
But the report released Monday by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) details how the government’s AI tools, used to “automate censorship, enhance surveillance and pre‑emptively suppress dissent,” havegrown more sophisticatedin the past two years – against the backdrop of a deepening US-China tech rivalry.
“China is harnessing AI to make its existing systems of control far more efficient and intrusive. AI lets the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) monitor more people, more closely, with less effort,” said Nathan Attrill, a report co-author and senior China analyst at ASPI, which is partially funded by the Australian and other foreign governments.
“In practice, AI has become the backbone of a far more pervasive and predictive form of authoritarian control.”
The authors added that the implications are both broad and deep – allowing Beijingeven greater controlin policing its population and managing the flow of information, as well as strengthening its power overseas as a global exporter of surveillance technology.
Beijing hasinvested hundreds of billions of dollarsinto AI-related businesses,making big stridesin research and development – despite the US working to restrict the supply of high-power AI chips to China.
The public has embraced the technology, too;a 2024 surveyby global research group IPSOS found that Chinese respondents were far more excited and optimistic about AI than their peers across 32 countries.
Even Chinese leader Xi Jinping has highlighted the importance of AI in the country’s evolving internet policy. At a November meeting with top CCP officials, he emphasized that AI “presents challenges to cyberspace governance while offering new avenues of support,” according toChinese state media– which the ASPI report claims are euphemisms for maintaining the regime’s power and stability.
ASPI’s findings aren’t entirely novel; otherresearchersandinstitutesaround the world have previously issuedsimilar reportsand warnings. Chinese leaders have spoken openly about their AI ambitions, some of which are shared by other countries. And it’s not yet a nationwide standard – local governments in big urban hubs with the existing digital infrastructure, like Beijing or Shanghai, are experimenting with AI in ways that rural provinces or smaller cities can’t yet.
But “many of the government’s intentions and policies are now becoming a reality,” said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist studying internet freedom at the University of California, Berkeley.
And, he added, “the report is showing us the clear indicator that China is heading to the direction (of using AI nationwide) … As soon as the digital infrastructure is ready, those things are being implemented.”
With AI now used in some places for policing, court proceedings and prison operations, the report claims the technology could eventually become integrated in every step of China’s already-opaque criminal justice system.
Monitoring begins with China’svast network of surveillance cameras. While there aren’t comprehensive statistics on the number of cameras in the country, estimates go up to 600 million cameras across China, according to the report. That’s roughly 3 cameras for every 7 people.
Like in many other countries, these cameras increasingly have AI capabilities like facial recognition and location tracking. For instance, documents from one Shanghai district detail plans for AI-powered cameras and drones to “automatically discover and intelligently enforce the law,” including potentially alerting police to crowd gatherings, the report found.
China’s Supreme Court has alsourged all courtsto “develop a competent artificial intelligence system by 2025,” which can be used in various legal proceedings including trials and administrative work, the report said. In one example, a Shanghai AI system can reportedly recommend whether judges and prosecutors should arrest or grant suspended sentences to criminal suspects and defendants.
Finally, there is a push for more “smart prisons” where AI tools can track prisoners’ locations and behaviors.In one prison, facial recognition cameras monitored prisoners’ expressions, flagging them for intervention if they seemed angry. At adrug rehabilitation center, prisoners underwent AI-assisted therapy, delivered through virtual reality (VR) headsets.
“A defendant caught through the help of AI-based surveillance and tried in an AI-assisted courtroom may then be sentenced based on the recommendation of an AI system to a ‘smart prison’ … incorporating extensive smart technology,” the report said.
China’s State Council Information Office and Ministry of Justice have not responded to CNN’s request for comments. They have previously criticized ASPI for receiving funding from US government agencies and claimed it has “no credibility.”
These smart technologies can help prevent crime and make Chinese cities far safer, Xiao acknowledged – but “because of the political system, the same technology can be used, and actually is being used, (for) political persecution.”
China’s court system, which answers to the CCP, already boasts a conviction rate above 99%.
Xiao pointed to several vulnerable groups who may be further targeted – including religious and ethnic minorities like Uyghurs, and political dissidents, who have long faced government repression.
Chinese companies, backed and funded by the central government, are now also working to develop large language models (LLMs) for minority languages – including Uyghur, Tibetan, Mongolian and Korean – for better “monitoring and controlling communications in those languages,” the report found.
These LLMs could potentially be used to surveil what minority communities are posting and sharing, and to manipulate what information they receive, according to Xiao and the report.
The report also highlighted the role of China’s biggest tech companies, calling them “key enablers and enforcers of the CCP’s online content censorship policies.”
These companies were always required to follow the central government’s content regulations – but have now become key figures developing censorship technologies and selling them to smaller companies around the country, sometimes cooperating with authorities on criminal cases, the report said.
For instance, ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok,censors content on Douyin, the version of the appprimarily used in China– blocking or downvoting politically sensitive content.
Tencent, a social media and gaming giant, uses AI to monitor user behavior and assign them “risk scores” based on their online activity, including penalties for violations across social media, chat groups and other communication platforms, the report said.
Search engine Baidu sells a number of content moderation tools and has cooperated with government agencies in more than 100 criminal cases, primarily regarding fraud and cybercrime, the report said.
“Online, AI enables real-time censorship and public-opinion shaping: platforms use automated moderation, sentiment analysis and recommendation algorithms to downrank criticism and push party-aligned narratives,” said Attrill, the report co-author.
CNN has reached out to all three companies for comment.
The growing ecosystem of Chinese AI surveillance and censorship tools, which small and medium enterprises are developing in-house as well, also has global implications, the report warned – with other authoritarian countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia also using AI to surveil their populations.
“Chinese LLMs these days are dominant open-weights models, which means that many other countries – their companies, their research units – might use the Chinese model because it’s cheap, it’s free,” said Xiao.
But “if you use those models, you’re fundamentally sitting on their platforms,” he added. “The censorship and the surveillance and the control, the influence, come with it.”"
The best hurricane forecasts of 2025 came from an AI model,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/climate/hurricane-forecast-melissa-ai-prediction-rapid-intensification,"Dec 3, 2025, 6:01 AM ET","The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ended November 30, showcased the growing capabilities of artificial intelligence for storm forecasting. And experts say there is no turning back.
This season, the National Hurricane Center supplemented its usual cadre of traditional models with AI-driven models, including one developed by Google DeepMind. The forecasters say that particular AI model allowed them to reach the “holy grail” of hurricane forecasting: accurate predictions of rapid changes in a storm’s intensity.
Forecasts that predict the path of a hurricane using traditional models have become far more accurate in recent years, but intensity forecasts lagged in reliability, particularly in terms of predicting rapid intensification.
The DeepMind model gave forecasters an unusually high degree of confidence thatHurricane Melissawas going torapidly intensifyabout three days before itstruck Jamaica as a catastrophic Category 5 storm. This was the first time NHC predicted a storm would become a Category 5 monster from the moment of its formation as a Category 1 hurricane.
Predicting rapid intensification is becoming a more critical task as climate change leads storms to undergo this process more frequently, including right up through landfall.
In their forecast at the time and in a recent, end-of-season analysis, NHC forecasters specifically cited the DeepMind model as giving them increased confidence in the forecast.
According to Wallace Hogsett, who serves as the science and operations officer at the NHC in Miami, forecasters are becoming more accustomed to trusting the output of AI-driven models, even if their ins and outs are not as well-understood as more traditional models.
Those traditional models are based in physics and use complex mathematical equations to simulate how heat, moisture, wind and more move and interact in the atmosphere. The European Model and the American Global Forecast System — long-favored tools of the NHC — take hours to arrive at a projection and require the use of powerful supercomputers to operate them.
In contrast, AI models are based on data about historical weather conditions and use that information to simulate a hurricane’s likely path and intensity. They can be run at high resolution, in the cloud and even on some desktop computers, in just minutes.
The DeepMind model is an AI ensemble, which means it is run many times at once, each with slightly varying atmospheric conditions to determine how sensitive the forecast is to minute differences that may exist as the simulation begins.
This can help forecasters get a better sense of statistical certainty in the projection and help them decide how much trust to put in the results.
“I think it’s pretty clear that these AI models are going to be useful, and they’re going to be a component of the hurricane forecast process going forward,” Hogsett said in an interview. “In particular, the Google DeepMind model appears to be one of the top-performing individual models.”
However, Hogsett downplayed the significance of how well the DeepMind ensemble — or any other model — performed during a particular storm, noting that what matters more is longer-term performance across an entire season with multiple storms.
A representative for Google DeepMind also cautioned against reading too much into the model’s capabilities based on its performance during a single storm, such as Hurricane Melissa.
But James Franklin, a former branch chief at the NHC, did an analysis and found that the Google DeepMind ensemble beat all the other computer model guidance in terms of its track and intensity forecast accuracy for the entire season, even though it did not perform evenly with each storm that formed.
Even with that result, however, Franklin still urged caution. “This is a new tool, and in some ways, it’s a more difficult tool to use than the European or the GFS,” he said. That’s because, to forecasters like him, AI models are “kind of a black box.”
“It looks for patterns, essentially in past data. It’s not tied to physics. It can come up with sort of any answer that it thinks it finds in the past data,” he said.
This can make it hard for meteorologists to evaluate the reliability of an AI forecast, and explains why being able to do multiple, slightly different model runs simultaneously is such an important feature of the DeepMind ensemble in particular. Meteorologists are used to other ensemble forecasting models, so using an AI-driven one could come somewhat more naturally for some.
Challenges aside, the NHC’s end-of-season analysis made it clear that AI is playing a role in improving rapid intensification forecasts, saying “significant progress is clearly underway.”
John Cangialosi, an NHC senior hurricane specialist, said hurricane forecasting is in its fastest period of change that he has seen in 20 years on the job. But it isn’t the case, he said, that the AI models are going to swoop in and take over from the physics-based ones, or even take forecasting jobs away from humans.
“AI just is an amazing tool. [But] it makes mistakes. It has errors, just like every other approach. There is no way that any of these [AI] models can get you the right answer, exactly the right answer for track, intensity, structure, or, more importantly, impacts,” Cangialosi said.
While tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Nvidia have had a head start in developing AI-based weather and climate models, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its international partners are also getting into the game with their own new AI models.

As high costs continue to squeeze US households, President Donald Trump is trying to allay affordability concerns and deflect blame for thefinancial strainfelt by millions of Americans. During a speech in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, he debuted a new economic message: Democrats drove up prices, “and we’re bringing them down.” But he undercut his argument at times, often veering intoinsult-ridden tangents. Trump repeatedly pinned high prices on former President Joe Biden, relentlessly mocking his predecessor. While Trump has dismissed concerns about affordability as a “Democratic hoax,” aFox News national surveyfrom November found that 76% of voters view the economy negatively.
Eileen Higgins will be thenext mayor of Miami, CNN projects, breaking a nearly 30-year Republican streak in the seat and giving Democrats another strong performance during the first year of Trump’s second term. Higgins, a former county commissioner, will defeat city manager Emilio Gonzalez, who was endorsed by Trump. Though Miami’s mayor wields little formal power, the role serves as a high-profile ambassador for the city, which has a large Latino population and has been at the epicenter of debates overimmigration enforcement operationsled by Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
One student is dead and another remains in critical condition following ashooting at Kentucky State Universityon Tuesday. Police said a 48-year-old suspect from Indiana, who is not a student, was arrested moments after opening fire. Authorities are now investigating what Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called an isolated attack on the historically Black university. It is the73rd shooting on school grounds this year, most of which took place on college campuses. The incidents have left at least 29 people dead and more than 100 other victims injured, according to a CNN analysis.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his team is preparing an updated version of the Trump administration’s peace plan and could send it to the US later today. Zelensky has been clear that his countrywill not surrender Russian-occupied territory, even as President Trump pressures him to agree to a peace deal with Moscow. In an interview with Politico taped Monday, Trump once again expressed frustration with Zelensky, saying, “He’s going to have to get on the ball and start accepting things, you know, when you’re losing.” Russia has insisted on territorial concessions being part of a settlement to end its war in Ukraine.

Inside the abandoned airport being transformed into a $30 billion sustainable city,https://www.cnn.com/travel/toronto-downsview-airport-yzd-c2e-spc,"Dec 10, 2025, 4:17 AM ET","EDITOR’S NOTE:Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions.Rolex’s Perpetual Planet Initiativehas partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.
Downsview Airport, in northwest Toronto, has undergone a few transformations in its time. About100 years ago, the first airfield was built: a short runway and an industrial building among farmers’ fields. It was the site of De Havilland Canada, a pioneering global aviation company.
It became a hub of warplane production during World War II, and in the early 1990s, the airfield was acquired by Bombardier, a Canadian aerospace manufacturer. In 2024, it was shuttered, as the firm relocated.
But in early 2026, construction begins on what will be the site’s biggest evolution yet. The 370-acre area is being developed into an urban district housing more than 50,000 residents and 75 acres of green and open space. It will become “YZD” –– a nod to the former airport call sign –– a 30-year, $30-billion development and one of the largest projects of its kind in North America.
The 2-kilometer (1.24-mile)-long runway, the site’s centerpiece, will become a pedestrianized park that links seven neighborhoods. Each one will be distinct, with its own housing, libraries, shops, schools and community centers, but the airstrip will act as the “connective tissue” — tying it all together while “respecting and celebrating the aerospace legacy of the site,” said Derek Goring, CEO of Northcrest Developments, the firm leading the project.
He told CNN that maintaining the history of the site was a key part of Northcrest’s vision — and also a huge advantage. “One of the biggest challenges with large-scale urban redevelopments is when you don’t have anything to start with, they can feel generic,” he said. “We want to lean into what’s there and make as much use of it as possible. It helps bring character and it makes it more interesting and unique.”
Preserving the site’s history is not just a sentimental decision, it’s a practical one in terms of its environmental footprint.
“There’s a lot of embedded carbon in the existing buildings and rather than tearing them down and building everything new, there’s a big carbon benefit to retaining those buildings,” said Goring.
The vast, industrial airport hangars, built between the1950s and 1990s, will be maintained and repurposed into commercial buildings, serving film production, light manufacturing and clean tech. Their roofs will be covered in grass and plants, which the developer claims will help to absorb rainwater and reduce the risk of flooding, while enhancing biodiversity within the urban center.
While the runway will not be retained in its current form, the concrete and asphalt it’s made from can be reused as aggregate for roads or pavements, said Goring. Some otherairports and military bases across Canadahave been found to contain “forever chemicals” that could contaminate groundwater. The developers said that while a small part of the YZD site “reflects its historic industrial and military past” they have hired specialized environmental consultants who will “help us understand and mitigate any legacy conditions,” and they will continue to review the site in collaboration with local authorities.
An earthquake ravaged this city ‘beyond imagination.’ Now it’s being rebuilt to withstand any natural disaster
Landscape architecture firm Michael van Valkenburgh Associates (MVVA) is tasked with creating a design concept for the runway, after winningan international competitionfor the project in October. Its goal is to bring nature back into the space.
Emily Mueller De Celis, partner at MVVA, harks back to the history of the site before it was an airfield, or agricultural land, and when it would have been part of the Carolinian forest in southern Ontario. They want to recreate native habitats and invite wildlife back into the site.
“The nature within the existing site had to be suppressed so that it was safe for aviation operations,” she explained, which meant deterring nesting birds despite its location along the Atlantic Flyway, a major migratory route.
“Re-naturalizing” the site will have big benefits in terms of water management too, she said. The YZD site is located at the high point of Toronto, between majorwatersheds. Through the design, MVVA wants to find ways of absorbing as much water as possible so that it reduces flood risk downstream. This will be done through strategic planting and the use of bioswales (vegetated channels that collect, filter and absorb stormwater).
Environmental sustainability feeds into Northcrest’s bigger picture. The huge development will take three decades to complete, so it needs to be forward-thinking and prepare for more extreme weather and the potential effects of climate change, said Goring.
He added that Northcrest has been working with Danish landscape designers SLA — famed for their work on projects such asCopenhagen’s waste-to-energy plant turned ski slope— on the concept of “City Nature,” which is about creating lots of green space in urban environments to improve quality of life.
Striking photos show nature reclaiming brutalist concrete
The YZD site is already surrounded by a network of train stations and subways, so the design will make use of these and encourage pedestrianization and car-free alternatives. There will be wide cycle lanes and a last-mile bus system.
“It doesn’t mean there won’t be cars — the runway is really the only car-free area,” said Goring, “But we’re trying to (make) walking and cycling the easiest, safest and most convenient ways to get around.”
Repurposing abandoned airfields into green parks and sustainable living areas has become something of a global trend, with examples such as Tempelhofer Feld in Berlin and theEllinikon Metropolitan Parkin Athens.
YZD is different, claims Goring. “The fact that our site sits at the geographic center of the largest metro area in Canada, with existing public transit infrastructure, means that it’s more of a city-building exercise than a park,” he said.
Construction of the first neighborhood, the 100-acre “Hangar District,” including 3,000 new homes, will begin early next year — with completion earmarked for 2031. It will be the first phase of a 30-year transformation, with the districts built one by one and the runway slowly evolving between them all.

One of the biggest challenges of the project is its sheer scale and the time it will take to build. Goring says they do not have $30 billion on tap, which is why they intend to build in phases, making an investment, getting a return, and re-investing.
Over such a long development period he expects current ideas and designs to evolve. The goal is not to be overly prescriptive from the get-go: “The world’s going to change a lot … (we’re not) trying to decide in 2025 what the future should be 20 or 30 years from now,” he said.
“Ultimately, it’s about delivering a really high quality of life,” he added, and merging into the current city. “We want it to feel like a part of Toronto.”"

"Trump’s new executive order brings together Big Tech, academics and the government on AI research",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/24/tech/ai-executive-order,"Nov 24, 2025, 5:34 PM ET","The White House on Monday launched a new program to allow the Department of Energy’s national laboratories to collaborate with tech companies and academics on using AI to further scientific research.
Under the new Genesis Mission, created by executive order, the Department of Energy will develop a new AI platform that uses federal scientific data to train AI models and agents made for scientific research. It underscores President Donald Trump’s focus on AI in his second term, coming after he’s introduced a sweeping package of initiatives and policy recommendations in July called theAI Action Plan.
The Genesis Mission aims to take the tech and business industries’ progress in AI and apply it to scientific research in health, energy, manufacturing and other fields, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on a call with reporters on Monday. He also said the program would lower energy prices for consumers, a key challenge as investment in AI have increased this year.
The DoE’s laboratories have been conducting research in everything from energy to health, applied materials and quantum science for decades. But a new platform under the initiative will let DoE labs, private companies and academic institutions share information more easily. That, in turn, will help researchers apply AI to areas like physics and chemistry.
“The private sector has launched artificial intelligence at huge scale, but with a little bit different focus, on language, on business, on processes, on consumer services.” Wright said. “What we’re doing here is just pivoting those efforts to focus on scientific discovery, engineering advancements.”
A key part of accomplishing that goal, according to Wright, is opening up access to data sets from the DoE’s national labs, which include facilities such as the Ames National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory among many others.
The platform will allow “multiple Federal research agencies” and “the private sector” to collaborate in order to “win and stay ahead in the AI race,”according to a White House fact sheet.
Key focus areas for the program include biotechnology, critical materials, nuclear fission and fusion energy, space exploration, quantum information science, and semiconductors and microelectronics.
Tech giants have already been working more closely with the DoE; Nvidia and Oracleannounced a partnershipin October to build supercomputers for Argonne National Laboratory. PC maker Dell is also developing a supercomputer for use at Berkeley Lab, according toa May announcement.The Genesis Mission is designed to facilitate more of those types of deals.
Tech companies and academics have also been researching the use of AI in health for years; Google introduceda family of AI modelsfine-tuned for the healthcare industry in 2023.
But the push to use AI in scientific research also comes as the technology stillgrapples with hallucinations, or a tendency for the tech to make things up.
The directive also strikes at a critical issue brought up by the AI boom: the toll it could take on energy grids. Residential electricity costsare on the rise, with the average price of electricity in America increasing 13% since 2022. Data centers, which are critical for powering AI services and training AI models, are expected to consume approximately 6.7% to 12% of US electricity in 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023, according to a report from theDepartment of Energy.
Wright said the program would “make our electricity grid more efficient and reverse price rises that have infuriated American citizens.”
But doing so won’t be an easy task; power grids are already in need of updating and maintenance, especially in the face of severe weather events. And the rate at which AI is advancing could make it increasingly difficult for the energy industry to keep up as tech giants pour billions into new data centers.
The executive order is just the latest Trump initiative to accelerate US AI development. Just last week, Trump spoke at theSaudi-US investment forum in Washington, where a flurry of partnerships were announced between American tech companies and Humain AI, a tech company backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.
The White House has also introduced unconventional arrangements that involve government dealings with private businesses as part of Trump’s push for American AI dominance. The US governmenttook a 10% stake in chipmaker Intelin August and struck a deal with AMD and Nvidiato take a 15% cut of chip sales to Chinain exchange for export licenses.
At the heart of Trump’s AI blitz is a desire to stay ahead of China in the AI race astrade tensions bubble between the two economic powerhouses. Chinese tech startup DeepSeek rattled US markets in January with the arrival of its R1 model, sparking fear that China may be further ahead in AI than previously expected.
Trump and some tech giantslike OpenAIhave argued that state-level regulation could slow innovation. Trump recently drafteda separate executive orderaimed at preventing such regulation, after Congress shot down a previous effort to block state-level AI regulations.
But easing regulation has raised safety concerns from lawmakers and online safety advocates after a series of reports this year indicated AI could contribute toself-harmandmental distress."
"Orbán meets Putin in Moscow to shore up Hungary’s energy supplies, making use of Trump exemption",https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/28/energy/orban-putin-moscow-hungary-energy-oil-intl,"Nov 28, 2025, 9:00 AM ET","Hungarian Prime MinisterViktor Orbánmet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow Friday to shore up Hungary’s energy supplies and discuss efforts to end the war in Ukraine.
Having spurned chances to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels, Hungary was facing aviolent economic shockafter the Trump administration last month imposedsanctionson Russia’s two biggest oil producers. Before the sanctions were announced, Orbán had warned that, without energy imports from Russia, Hungary’s economy would be brought “to its knees.”
But Orbán, a hard-right populist and a darling of the MAGA movement, was spared that shock after US President Donald Trump granted Hungary aone-year exemptionfrom the sanctions, sayingit had been “difficult” for his ally to wean the country off Russian oil since it is landlocked.
“We recently travelled to Washington to secure Hungary’s exemption from the American sanctions on Russian energy: we succeeded. Now we must take the next step, guaranteeing that deliveries to Hungary continue without interruption,” Orbán wrote on social media Friday.
“This is why I am going to Russia today: to make sure Hungary’s energy supply remains secure and affordable this winter and in the year ahead,” he added.
Although Trump, explaining why he was considering granting Hungary an exemption, said it had been “very difficult for him (Orbán) to get the oil and gas from other areas” since “they don’t have ports,” analysts have disputed this reasoning.
After Moscow’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, European Union countries moved to slash Russian energy imports in a bid to deplete the Kremlin’s war chest. However, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – three Central European nations – were given an exemption from a ban on importingRussian crude oil, giving them time to reduce their reliance on Moscow.
While the Czech Republic has since phased out Russian crude oil, Hungary and Slovakia used the exemption to deepen their dependence. Russian crude oil made up 86% of all Hungarian purchases of crude in 2024, up from 61% pre-invasion. So far this year, 92% of Hungary’s crude oil imports have been from Russia.
Slovakia, meanwhile, is “almost 100% dependent” on supply from Moscow, according to areportin May from the Center for the Study of Democracy and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.
Isaac Levi, an analyst at CREA, told CNN earlier this month that the latest US exemption is a “terrible and unnecessary mistake that will allow over €1 billion ($1.2 billion) to flow into the Kremlin’s war chest.”
He said the Trump administration’s rationale for the exemption was not credible, since the Czech Republic, another landlocked country, no longer imports Russian crude oil and has lower fuel prices at the pump than Hungary. “This clearly shows that the oil flows that continue to finance Putin’s war in Ukraine are entirely unnecessary,” Levi said.
During Friday’s meeting in Moscow, Orbán and Putin also discussed recent US-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Putin did not rule out Friday the possibility of a summit in Budapest with Trump, Russian state media reported.
Putin and Trump had agreed in October to meet in the Hungarian capital to discuss ending the conflict, but those plans were swiftly shelved, with Trump saying he did not want the talks to be a waste of time."

Costco is poking the Trump bear,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/business/costco-trump-tariffs,"Dec 3, 2025, 5:00 AM ET","Big public companies have mostly treated President Donald Trump with kid gloves during his second term. They’ve quietly avoided conflict while seeking favor with ornate gifts, large donations to his pet projects and strategic deployments of CEOs to the Oval Office.
That’s what made Costco’s decision last week tosue the Trump administrationso shocking.
Costco on Friday filed a lawsuit that contends Trump overstepped his emergency powers by imposing sweeping tariffs – and claimed the company is due a refund.
Costco isn’t alone. A handful of other companies have separately sued the government on similar grounds, including Bumble Bee Foods, Ray-Bans parent EssilorLuxottica, Revlon and Kawasaki Motors. But Costco is the highest profile public company to do battle with the Trump White House on tariffs.
Few major corporations have been willing to publicly stick their necks out to combat Trump’s policies since he took office in January. That stands in contrast to his first term, when businesses and their leaders felt more comfortable speaking out – most notably whenmultiple CEOs quit his business councilover comments Trump made in 2017 that downplayedneo-Nazi violencein Charlottesville, Virginia.
But Trump’s second term has largely been marked by Corporate America’s acquiescence. Several factors are at play:
But if businesses are going to start speaking out against Trump’s policies, tariffs may be the logical place to start.
Tariffs are broadly – and increasingly – unpopular with Americans, who connect them with the country’s affordability crisis.
A CBS Newspollconducted in late October found that just 38% of Americans favor the United States placing new tariffs on goods imported from other countries. A clear majority, 62%, oppose. That marks a significant reversal from November 2024, when Americans narrowly favored new tariffs by 52% to 48% in a CBS Newspollat that time.
Bigger picture, a poll published byFox Newslast month showed only 15% of respondents said Trump’s policies are helping their financial situation, compared to 46% who said they are hurting.
So Costco is probably not going to anger too many customers by speaking out against a trade policy that is unpopular in the first place.
Costco didn’t appear overly concerned: It used some choice words in its lawsuit, decrying “the pell-mell manner by which these on-again/off-again” tariffs were “threatened, modified, suspended, and re-imposed, with the markets gyrating in response.” The company didn’t say how much it paid in tariffs, but it demanded that they be refunded in full.
The Supreme Court appeared ready to declare the bulk of Trump’s tariffs illegal, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett declared the refund process would almost certainly be “a mess.” Costco, seeing the handwriting on the wall, is trying to get in line early to collect.
Also, Costco may be uniquely situated. For example, the companydoubled down on its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, or DEI, while many other companies rapidly abandoned them in the face of a pressure campaign from Trump and conservative media. And with its emphasis on value in the face of high prices, Costco has proven resilient with customers.
Going up against Trump’s tariffs has had mixed results. Some high-profile businesses that tried have been met with Trump’s wrath.
In April, White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt held up a photo of Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos in a press briefing andpublicly shamed the companyfor considering advertising tariff costs to customers. Trump similarlythreatened Walmartafter the company said it would raise prices because of tariffs.
In a variation on the theme, Apple said in May that it would shift its US iPhone production to India from China after Trump imposed steep tariffs that would cost itnearly $1 trilliona quarter. An upset Trump a couple weeks later in Qatar said he had “a little problem” with CEO Tim Cook because of Apple’s failure to bring iPhone production to the United States. By the end of the month, Trump hadthreatened a 25% tariffon Apple’s products.
But in August, Cook made a public appearance in the Oval Office, promising anadditional $100 billionin US investment, and presented Trump with a plaque with a24K gold base. The tariff threat vanished.
Still, with the Supreme Court decision looming and tariff popularity fading, some analysts believe Costco’s lawsuit could attract followers.
“I expect many other companies will do the same,” said Timothy Brightbill, a partner at Wiley who focuses on international trade.
Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, agreed, arguing that Costco could give permission for some companies on the fence to file suit.
But some companies will still hesitate, he predicted.
“My guess is the more business you have before the federal government, the less likely you are to sue,” said Mills."

Larry Summers receives lifetime ban from prestigious economic association over Epstein ties,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/business/larry-summers-lifetime-ban-economic-association-epstein-ties,"Dec 2, 2025, 5:15 PM ET","Larry Summers has been banned for life from the American Economic Association, a professional organization for economists with more than 17,000 members, over his ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
In a statement on Tuesday, the group said it had accepted Summers’ voluntary resignation.
“Effective immediately, the AEA has imposed a lifetime prohibition on Mr. Summers’ attending, speaking at, or otherwise participating in AEA-sponsored events or activities, including serving in any editorial or refereeing capacity for AEA journals,” the organizationsaid.
Summers has long been one of America’s most prominent economists, serving as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and as president of Harvard University.
He also has a longstanding relationship with AEA. In 1993, Summersreceivedthe group’s John Bates Clark Medal, given to outstanding economists under age 40.
But the AEA’s ban follows new details of Summers’ relationship with Epstein, after a House committee published years of email correspondence between the two men last month, including exchanges where Summers made sexist remarks and sought romantic advice from Epstein.
In a statement last month, Summerssaid he was “deeply ashamed”of his actions and recognized “the pain they have caused,” adding that he would step back from public commitments.
Summers has sincetaken leave from teachingat Harvard while the university investigates his relationship with Epstein. He also resigned from his position on theboard of OpenAI.
“The AEA condemns Mr. Summers’ conduct, as reflected in publicly reported communications, as fundamentally inconsistent with its standards of professional integrity and with the trust placed in mentors within the economics profession,” the AEA said Tuesday."

Data centers powering the AI boom are pitting states against each other,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/28/politics/democrats-data-centers-abundance,"Nov 28, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","Just before her victory this fall, New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill jabbed at nearby Virginia, which also had a governor’s race, over its booming data center market.
“Right now, we need to produce power here in our state … because Virginia has a million data centers which are sucking all the power out of our market,” Sherrill said at one debate, “We need to produce here, lower costs here, and stop putting the costs on the ratepayers of New Jersey.” (Sherrill was exaggerating: Virginia has 666 data centers, according tothe Data Center Map, while New Jersey has 82.)
A CNN reporter read Sherrill’s quotejust before the November 4 electionto Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger. Sherrill and Spanberger arelongtime friends and former roommates.
“Mikie!” Spanberger responded. “Go ahead. We’ll take the revenue.”
While Spanberger and others have celebrated the economic benefits of data centers, the incoming governor also noted in her victory speech that tech corporations would have to develop sustainably and cover their costs, with energy bills spiking across the region.
Democrats campaigning on affordability are confronting the demands created by data centers that create jobs, often in areas that have long needed them, but that also suck up power. And the issue is converging with a national party debate about how to embrace economic development and growth — the“Abundance” mindset.
Officials and candidates across the country are lamenting rising power bills, water usage and the potential climate impact of the AI boom. But they’re hard-pressed to turn down job-creating investments that could go to their neighbors instead – a tension that’s felt beyond the East Coast.
“We are, by the nature of the grid, connected to our neighboring states,” said Raúl Torrez, the Democratic attorney general in New Mexico. His state is next to Texas, which has 413 data centers, according to the Data Center Map, compared with New Mexico’s 22.
“I will say that it is very difficult to be right next to a state that just takes a maybe less aggressive approach in terms of protecting consumers,” Torrez said.
Thirteen states and the District of Columbia are connected to the same grid as New Jersey and Virginia. That grid, known as PJM, is the country’s largest, covering a swath of competitive political territory.
Some of the states on that grid are net producers of energy; others are net consumers. But the opening of data centers across nearly all of them is creating structural pressure on a shared system. Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility, is setto increase ratesby around 9%; in New Jersey, utility bills spiked by more than 20% this year. Communities across the region are protesting developments.
“We’re going to produce more energy and we’re going to lower energy costs. We are going to produce more energy here in Virginia and make sure that data centers pay their fair share,” Spanberger said during her victory speech.
But a review from the Virginia General Assembly last year laid out the scale of the challenge, even as it also found the data center industry contributes $9.1 billion in GDP to the state economy.
“The state could encourage or require data centers to take actions to help address their energy impacts by promoting development of renewable energy generation, participating in demand response programs, and managing energy efficiency,” the General Assembly review reads. “However, these actions would have only a marginal impact on decreasing data center energy demand.”
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a potential 2028 presidential contender, outlined the challenge — and the escalating political stakes — at an energy conference in September. Utility rates in Pennsylvaniajumped5% to 12% statewide this summer.
“Let’s face it: Change is needed to keep energy costs low, bring new energy generation onto the grid more quickly,” he said.
Data center campuses can offer a lifeline to communities eager for investment, promising jobs and tax receipts. They’re often developed in rural areas, far from traditional economic hotbeds. Microsoft, among the tech giants pouring billions into data centers, has touted itscommunity developmentin Mecklenburg, a county in the southern portion of Virginia bordering North Carolina.
Another Microsoft data center opened in the industrial area once set aside for Foxconn, the Taiwanese technology giantthat didn’t meetits initial commitment during Trump’s first term to open an electronic plant.
But that single data center requires more electricity than every home in Milwaukee, the state’s largest city, according to Mitchell Berman, a Democrat running for Congress in Wisconsin’s battleground 1st Congressional District next year.
“We don’t want to get in the way, or have too much of a regulatory burden. We need progress; that’s ultimately what drives our success in manufacturing, in AI and in the technology space,” Berman said. “But we have to do it within reason, and not at the expense of people in our communities.”
Carol Obando-Derstine, a Democrat running in Pennsylvania’s 7th District next year, said she was “hearing from a lot of people all the time, reacting to news of data centers.”
“What they are concerned about is the rising costs of utilities, what they pay for energy. When they see news of folks, these billionaire companies coming into the area, they are concerned about the impact it’ll have on their bills,” Obando-Derstine said.
Massachusetts Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, said that “one guiding principle for policy around these data centers and their effects on the economy is, there needs to be strong local input on the terms and conditions.”
“As a general rule, my view is that the tech companies need to pay for the cost spillovers, particularly power and water,” he said.
But Auchincloss, like many lawmakers, said he wants to establish a balance between limiting costs and promoting development.
“There’s a lot of granularity here, so I’m hesitant to announce one national point of view — it changes community by community, and policymakers should be humble about that,” he said.

Why Trump is speaking like a Democrat about Obamacare,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/business/obamacare-extension-trump-republicans-subsidies,"Dec 4, 2025, 5:01 AM ET","President Donald Trump ispushing for an extensionof soon-to-expire enhanced Obamacare subsidies – a key Democratic demand that Republicans fought fiercely and that was the basis for the longest-ever government shutdown.
Despite his populist campaign-trail rhetoric, Trump has for the most part governed like a typical Republican, cutting taxes and regulations that largely benefit the wealthy and big businesses. He fought against Obamacare for years, and his “One Big Beautiful Bill” act is expected to cut more than $1 trillion from health care and food stamps. That’s why his support for extending the enhanced subsidies has surprised some political observers.
But one simple fact of government pushed Trump and some congressional Republicans into backing Obamacare anyway: It’s really hard to take away government subsidies once they’ve been put into effect.
No politician wants to be the Grinch who stole subsidies. And Trump is particularly struggling to show that his policies are lowering the cost of living for millions of struggling Americans.
Roughly 22 million Americans use enhanced Obamacare subsidies. If the subsidies lapse at year-end, Americans face hundreds of dollars –and in some cases close to $1,000– in monthly premium increases for their health care. Many people would be forced into difficult choices, including abandoning health insurance altogether.
Democrats put this issue front and center in the month-and-a-half government shutdown, banging the drum about the looming expiration and slamming Republicans’ hesitation to extend the subsidies.
The subsidies help American wallets. Taking them away could hurt – a lot.
Trump campaigned in 2016 on overturning Obamacare, then a relatively nascent government-supported health care program for millions of Americans who lacked employer-sponsored health insurance – and the means to pay for insurance out of pocket. The Senate voted on a repeal in 2017, but the bill failed – famously killed by the late GOPSen. John McCain’s thumbs down.
Similarly, Democrats have largely been unable to undo Republicans’ tax cuts.
After decades of a top income tax rate of at least 70% for the wealthiest Americans, former President Ronald Reagan in 1982 knocked that down to 50% and in 1987 got it below 40%. Former President George W. Bush lowered the top bracket again to 35%.
Democrats have never come close to getting that bracket back up to the pre-Reagan era.
In 2013, former President Barack Obama raised the top bracket back to near 40%, while maintaining lower taxes for everyone else.
And the Republican party, which fiercely fought former President Lyndon Johnson’s Medicare and former President Franklin Roosevelt’s Social Security when they were introduced, has since embraced those wildly popular government subsidies.
Some Republicans have supported Medicaid, too, even as they recently added stringent work requirements that are expected to kick millions of Americans off its rolls. Trumprepeatedly instructed Republicansnot tocut a pennyfrom Medicare and Social Security benefits during his campaign for his tax and spending policy bill this spring.
“There’s a fundamental difference between policy expansion and policy retrenchment,” said Jesse Rhodes, professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “Going back to the New Deal era and the Great Society era, Republicans were opposed to significant expansions to retirement security, health care expansion, you name it. But once these policies are in place, there is a long history of bipartisan cooperation to support these policies.”
Sometimes benefits do expire, though. Former President Joe Biden’s emergency expansion of the child tax credit nearly halved the share of children living in poverty in 2021. But Congress failed to extend the measure, and America’s child poverty rate surged to 12.4% from 5.2%, according to theInstitute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
Similarly, the expiration of the pause in student loan payments last year sent delinquencies surging to nearly 8% from less than 1% before the pause expired, according to theNew York Fed.
Trump is already losing the affordability argument to Democrats. Putting tens of millions of Americans at risk for higher health care costs won’t help his case.
Trump hasn’t unveiled his policy yet, hamstrung by congressional Republicans who have balked at his subsidy extension plan. The initial White House proposal was expected to include an extension combined with reforms that limit the scope of the subsidies.
Republicans’ constituents are clamoring for a deal: Anew KFF pollshows more than 70% of Republicans with Obamacare coverage don’t want their enhanced premium subsidies to expire.
“You know, the president believes in affordable health care,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters on Wednesday. “And so he’s very, very motivated to resolve this issue, but he’s got to work with Congress to come up with something that everybody agrees to.”
Trump officials are working on an extension plan that Republicans can live with, people familiar with the matter told CNN. Some Republican members of Congress have come out in favor of a short-term extension. And Trump himself this week said he continued to support a deal.
“Something’s going to happen,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. “It’s probably not going to be easy.”"
"‘Cooperation looks different today’: WEF president on growth, technology and developing economies",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/world/wef-president-borge-brende-cooperation-growth-technology-spc,"Dec 10, 2025, 5:22 AM ET","The global economy is “undergoing one of itsmost turbulentperiods in decades,” according to a recent World Economic Forum (WEF) report, with geopolitical instability, trade realignments, and technological advancements accelerating a reconfiguration of the economic order.
It notes that almost nine in 10 of surveyed chief economists foresee growth in advanced economies depending primarily on access to technology and know-how, but they expect developing countries to continue to depend more on capital and natural resources.
Ahead of the WEF annual meeting next January, its president and CEO Børge Brende spoke to CNN at the Doha Forum, in Qatar, about the challenges facing the global economy.
The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.
CNN: What do you predict will be the priorities and global challenges that will dominate the 2026 World Economic Forum?
Børge Brende:Our theme of the meeting is the spirit of dialogue. What we need more of in this world is for people to talk to each other and try to solve common challenges.
The world isn’t looking that bad. We still have more than 3% economic growth, and we think that new technologies, especially artificial intelligence, will also increase productivity and lead to growth in the future.
Like trade was a growth engine for decades, we think new technologies can do that and then we can see more prosperity.
CNN: Do you believe that global cooperation is still possible in an era defined by fragmentation and mistrust?
Brende:Cooperation is still indispensable, but it looks different from in the past. In the past it was easier to get multilateral agreements, meaning that all countries came together and they agreed on something.
Today, we will see cooperation in a different way. Countries that have things in common will come together in so-called “plurilaterals” and then they will move. But not all the UN members will move in the same configuration.
We are seeing that organizations and countries are adapting to a new reality that (it) is a more competitive world.
CNN: How can the WEF ensure developing countries have a seat at the table rather than being the subject of the discussion?
Brende:It’s very important that we see substantial growth in the developing countries and also in emerging economies.
I’m overall optimistic when it comes to developing countries seeing substantial growth in the years to come. They have a young population; they have good dividend when it comes to human capital.
But there are of course obstacles to overcome, and that’s what we’re working on.
We want to secure a continuation of foreign direct investments to developing countries, and we have to avoid any kind of war. War and conflict kill growth and make it impossible to eradicate poverty."
Trump’s tax and spending law is a short-term win but long-term headache for Wall Street,https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/17/investing/us-stock-market-trump-bill,,"President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending legislation is providing short-term clarity for Wall Street — but fueling concerns about the long-term health of the US economy, investors say.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which Trumpsigned into lawon July 4, is a positive for investors because of the certainty it provides for markets. But the bill is set toworsen the nation’s debt burdenover time, according to forecasts, which could put the government’s finances and the economy on shakier grounds.
For Wall Street, the legislation is not expected to spur growth or provide much of a boost to markets. Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, said the law is not stimulative like Trump’s first-term tax cuts, and coupled with tariffs, it’s not expected provide a meaningful tailwind for markets,

“There are very modest tax benefits that go into some areas, but the more important components are ultimately cutbacks in support for households that are already kind of struggling,” Green said. “This is a very regressive tax program.”
The package also includes some worries for investors because it does not address America’s accumulating debt load. The law’s passing has drawn ire from economists and deficit hawks who havewarned about the debt-to-economic growth ratioand the potential for a future debt crisis.
“Markets had already priced in much of the expected fiscal and economic impact,” investors at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a July 4 note. “However, the longer-term outlook is clouded by persistent deficits.”
Investors this year have been on a roller coaster ride as markets dropped amid trade uncertainty and have soared torecord highs. As Congress deliberated Trump’s bill, it was another source of uncertainty.
Signing the bill into law resolved that uncertainty, Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, said.
“We’ve still got tariff noise, but at least we don’t have to worry about something terrible happening with the tax bill,” Hatfield said. “It’s relief. It’s more like the absence of pain than it is pleasure.”
The tax cuts from Trump’s first term were set to expire at the end of the year, which would have resulted in a massive tax hike. Passing the bill, which extends those cuts, averts that scenario, Hatfield said.
The bill also raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, giving lawmakers relief about the impending “X date,” when the government was set to hit its borrowing limit.
For the stock market, however, there isn’t much juice in the legislation, Hatfield said.
“It’s probably slightly good for investors, but not significant,” he said. “We don’t view it as being stimulative to the economy.”
Trump during his campaign proposedlowering the corporate tax ratefrom 21% to 15%. That proposal did not make it into the final legislation, which held the corporate tax rate steady at 21%.
Investors at UBS said the bill’s passage provides a “modest fiscal boost for 2026,” noting other tax cuts and spending reforms “may support earnings growth at the margin.”
Wall Street analysts haveraised concernsthis year about global investors’ appetite for holding US debt. Those nerves were exacerbated by the size of Trump’s bill.
Long-term US debt, which is usually considered the safe, risk-free corner of the market, has come under scrutiny as the legislation is setto increase federal deficits.
Higher deficits mean the government would have to issue more debt to finance its spending. An increase in the supply of government bonds coupled with a rising debt load could mean the need to offer higher rates to attract investors. Higher rates correspond to higher borrowing costs for Americans.

“We’ve been highlighting the precarious position of the US government’s indebtedness for some time now, and, if left unchecked, we view debt as the single greatest risk to the ‘special status’ of the US in financial markets,” investors at BlackRock said in a June 30 note.
Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, said he doesn’t expect significant short-term effects on the bond market, but in the long run, he expects the debt accumulation will push interest rates higher.
“If the Fed’s independence is compromised with theappointment of a new chair, I think this will exacerbate the upward impact on longer-maturity Treasury yields,” Auerbach said.
Brian Rehling, head of global fixed income strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he thinks Republicans lawmakers are hoping that thebill will spur growth, helping offset the rising debt burden. “That remains to be seen,” he said.
Similar to Auerbach, Rehling said he doesn’t think there will be an immediate effect on the demand for bonds. But he expects yields to rise in the long run to compensate investors for the worsening fiscal outlook.
“I don’t think this is a moment in time where the bond vigilantes come out and you see kind of explosive moves to the upside in yields,” Rehling said.
“This is going to lead to the Treasury issuing more debt to cover these expenses,” he said. “And as supply comes onto the market, you would expect, just simple supply and demand, all else equal, that rates are going to have to increase to bring that demand into the market.”"
Trump’s push for health care plan stalls ahead of looming subsidy expiration,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/politics/health-care-plan-trump-stall-aca,"Dec 2, 2025, 12:31 PM ET","President Donald Trump’s push for anew health care planhas stalled, amiddisagreements within the GOPover the extension of key enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, three people familiar with the matter told CNN.
The dispute has slowed the administration’s efforts to avert alooming spikein health insurance premiums, raising doubts about whether it will have any proposal ready in time for a Senate vote as early as next week on the fate of the ACA subsidies relied on by roughly 22 million people.
The White House initially expected to roll out a plan last week that paired an extension of the subsidies with a range of conservative reforms meant to limit their scope. But that was scrapped following sharp backlash from Republican lawmakers who were blindsided by the framework and deeply opposed to its core elements.
Trump officials attempting to rework the proposal are now unlikely to finalize a new plan this week, the people familiar with the matter said, raising the odds that Senate Republicans will be left without a Trump-endorsed proposal to counter Democrats’ call for passing a simple extension of the ACA subsidies before the funding expires at the end of the year.
The White House declined to comment.
Trump has continued to push aides to develop a health care plan over worries that voters will blame him for rising premiums should he fail to present an alternative, and the administration could still reach a sudden breakthrough, the people familiar with the matter cautioned.
At a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump insisted that “something’s going to happen,” though he acknowledged it was far from a sure bet.
“It’s probably not going to be easy,” he said, complaining that Democrats “don’t want to make a good deal for the people.”
Republicans in Congress, too, have been privately ramping up pressure on the administration to get behind a plan that averts steep price hikes in 2026 — a critical midterm year that could endanger their own seats.
Some GOP lawmakers, particularly moderate members of the caucus, are keenly aware that many Affordable Care Act enrollees are Republican. In fact, the enhanced subsidies helped spur a record 24 million people to sign up for 2025 coverage, many of them from red states. More than half of Obamacare enrollees live in districts represented by a Republican, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.
“I encouraged the president to continue on this path of trying to move forward with a temporary extension,” said GOP Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York, who added that Congress would still need to overhaul the underlying structure of the ACA subsidies. “We have to do our best to protect American people and consumers.”
If the Biden-era subsidies expire, the premiums people pay are expected to more than double next year, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. Plus, an estimated 2 million more people will be uninsured next year, the Congressional Budget Office found.
Still, the administration’s initial stumbles underscore the steep challenge that the White House faces in winning consensus within the GOP on any major health care proposal — much less one that has a shot at garnering enough support from Democrats to make it into law.
Senate Republicans agreed to hold a vote this month on extending the ACA subsidies as part of a deal with Democrats to fund the government  and end a record-long shutdown. Most Republican lawmakers are staunchly opposed to a simple extension.
“The bottom line is, let them expire,” GOP Rep. Keith Self of Texas said Tuesday when asked about his preferred plan for addressing the looming cliff.
Trump has similarly signaled his opposition to a simple extension, calling instead for a plan that would send federal funding directly to consumers, rather than paying it to insurance companies to subsidize health care premiums. He repeatedly criticized the ACA as an unsalvageable “disaster,” prompting a scramble among Republican lawmakers to draw up plans that fit with his mandate that “all the money go to the people, and that the people go out and buy their own health care.”
Yet within the administration, officials ultimately opted for a somewhat different approach, crafting a proposal that modified the existing ACA subsidy program rather than overhauling it in hopes of putting pressure on moderate Democrats to strike a quick deal.
The White House’s original framework would have extended the subsidies for two years, but set new income limits and required that all enrollees pay a minimum monthly premium. It also proposed incentivizing people to pick lower-tier plans by allowing them to funnel some federal aid into health savings accounts. And it would have set the stage to allow consumers to pick less expensive but less comprehensive plans outside the Affordable Care Act exchanges, which would likely undermine Obamacare.
The dissonance between Trump’s rhetoric and his plan surprised many conservatives on Capitol Hill, who rejected the idea of voting to continue part of a health care law they’ve opposed for more than a decade. That division over continuing the subsidies in any form, or allowing them to expire, has prevented the party from coalescing behind a single proposal.
Roughly 22 million people benefit from the enhanced tax credits, which polling shows are broadly popular with voters. That has raised fears among some Trump advisers and Republican lawmakers about the political ramifications of letting them run out, which would push premiums higher at a moment when much of the electorate is already unhappy with the cost of living.
“I think we need to do something,” said Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, a battleground Republican who has been a vocal supporter of preventing those health care price hikes, while working to fix what he calls a broken system.
Asked whether anything can be done before the end-of-the-year expiration of funding for the enhanced subsidies, LaLota pointed to Congress’ tendency to act only ahead of key deadlines: “Time winds up becoming a pressure cooker.”
Trump administration officials in recent days have sought to resolve lawmakers’ concerns over continuing the subsidies, the people familiar with the matter said, including exploring ways to maintain the funding through some alternate program that members might be more willing to support.
They are also grappling with demands that any plan including so-called Hyde protections prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortion — a key GOP priority, yet one that would complicate any prospect of winning Democratic support.
But with the Senate poised to vote as soon as next week, the prospect of striking a deal ahead of that deadline has grown exceedingly dim.
Some Republicans, like Malliotakis, have been in private talks with rank-and-file Democrats for weeks to find a path forward that can win support in both chambers.
“This is not a problem that Republicans created, and so Republicans on their own will not be able to resolve it,” Malliotakis said. “This needs to be a bipartisan solution.”

CNN exclusive: Colombian president says oil is ‘at the heart of’ US pressure campaign on Venezuela,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/26/americas/colombia-petro-venezuela-oil-us-latam-intl,"Nov 26, 2025, 12:01 AM ET","AsUS military activityramps up in the Caribbean and the Pacific, Colombia’s president alleged the Trump administration’s pressure campaign on Venezuela is more about accessing the South American country’s oil than fighting drug trafficking.
“(Oil) is at the heart of the matter,” Gustavo Petro told CNN in an exclusive interview, noting that Venezuela has what are considered the largest oil reserves in the world.
“So, that’s a negotiation about oil. I believe that is (US President Donald) Trump’s logic. He’s not thinking about the democratization of Venezuela, let alone the narco-trafficking,” he continued, adding that Venezuela is not considered a major drug producer and that only a relatively small portion of the global drugs trade flows through the country.
Petro has been at odds with Trump since he returned to the White House. In the past year, the Colombian leader has harshly criticized the Trump administration’s immigration policies, its support for Israel and its military activity around Latin America.
On Tuesday, he accused the US of trying to impose its will on its neighbors, comparing its actions to imperialism. “The United States cannot be considered an empire, but one of the nations among others,” the president said.
In response to Petro’s comments, a US State Department spokesperson said the Trump administration remains “firm in its counter-drug operations in the Caribbean and its commitment to protecting Americans from the (Venezuelan President Nicolás) Maduro regime’s deadly poison.”
CNN has also reached out to the White House for comment.
Asked if he had a message to the American people, Petro replied, “My message is the one they give to all members of the United States special forces: Your function, as they say in the oaths, is to fight against oppression. I repeated that on the streets in the United States, and it also cost me,” Petro said.
He appeared to be referring to the US State Departmentrevoking his visaat the conclusion of the UN General Assembly in September after he publicly called on American soldiers to disobey Trump and “not to point their rifles at humanity.”
It’s one of the many actions the Trump administration has taken against the Colombian leader in recent months.
Colombians caught in fallout of Trump-Petro feud
In October, the US Treasurysanctioned Petro, accusing him of playing a “role in the global illicit drug trade,” a claim the Colombian leader has rejected.
The sanctions were imposed days after Trump said he wouldhalt all US payments and subsidiesto Colombia, claiming Petro “does nothing to stop” the production of drugs in his country.
Petro defended his efforts to fight the drug trade, telling CNN that his government had seized more cocaine than any other in history. “So much so that in recent years, I have managed to ensure that the growth in crops, which is stagnating, is far surpassed by the growth in seizures,” he said.
Asked why Trump hadn’t acknowledged this, Petro said: “Because of pride. Because he thinks I’m a subversive thug, a terrorist, and things like that, simply because I was a member of the M-19,” a Colombian guerrilla movement active in the 1970s and 1980s.
Petro also told CNN that he believes the US is comparing him to Maduro.
His comments come a day after the US designated theCartel de los Soles, an alleged drug trafficking group that the US has claimed Maduro leads, as a foreign terrorist organization. Venezuela has denied the claims, and experts say the phrase is more a description of allegedly corrupt government officials than an organized crime group.
While Maduro has a problem with democracy, Petro said he is not that convinced about the Venezuelan president’s drug trafficking links.
“The problem of Maduro is called democracy … the lack of democracy,” Petro told CNN, adding that “no Colombian investigation … has shown us a relationship between Colombian drug trafficking and Maduro.”
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Venezuela isnot a cocaine-producing country. Of the 3,700 tons of coca produced worldwide, more than 2,500 tons come from Colombia, while Venezuela does not appear on production maps, according to the UNODC, which said: “The majority of Colombian cocaine is being trafficked north along the Pacific coast.”
Investigators from the US Drug Enforcement Agency reached similar conclusions, writing in their annual report published in March that 84% of the cocaine seized in the US comes from Colombia.
Over the weekend, Colombian news programNoticias Caracolreported alleged links between Colombian officials and dissidents of the now-defunct rebel group FARC. According to the report, senior military and intelligence officials shared sensitive intelligence with the armed groups and advised them about how to secretly acquire weapons and evade military scrutiny.
Petro has denied the allegations but acknowledged to CNN on Tuesday that ties between officials and drug traffickers have existed for years, even before he took office.
A spokesperson for the US State Department said it is aware of the recent reports and urged Petro and other Colombian institutions to “thoroughly investigate these allegations and take all appropriate actions.”
Colombia has long been Washington’s most reliable ally in South America on security and defense. In 2022, the Biden administration designated the Andean country as a “major non-NATO ally.”
Despite recent tensions at the top, US-Colombia relations remain intact.
US Secretary of StateMarco Rubiohas made clear publicly that the administration’s issues are with Petro, not the institutions in Colombia.
“Our relationships with the people of Colombia, the economic sector of Colombia, the majority of people in politics in Colombia, and their institutions, in particular their defense institutions, are strong and enduring, and they’re going to be strong and enduring long after this individual is no longer the president there,” Rubio previously said.

Trump is threatening to attack a country with more oil than Iraq,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/business/venezuela-oil-trump,"Dec 2, 2025, 4:01 AM ET","The United States appearsready for warwith Venezuela, a prospect that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro this weekend attributed to America’s desire to control the country’s vast oil reserves.
The USState Department has deniedthat oil played a central role in America’s military sending more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops to the region – or that oil is behind President Donald Trump’s warnings that land strikescould be imminentand planes shouldavoid Venezuelan air space. Instead, the Trump administration says its military threats are part of America’s effort to stop flows of undocumented migrants and illegal drugs from Venezuela.
Whatever the rationale behind the rapidly intensifying situation in the Caribbean, if regime change is coming to Venezuela, the largest proven oil reserve on Earth will play a central role in the country’s future.
Most people associate large oil stockpiles with the Middle East or Texas, but Venezuela is sitting on a massive 303 billion barrels worth of crude – about a fifth of the world’s global reserves, according to theUS Energy Information Administration. It’s the planet’s single-largest known mass of crude oil.
Venezuela’s potential far exceeds its actual output.
Venezuela produces about 1 million barrels of oil per day – no slouch, but only about 0.8% of global crude production. That’s less than half of what it produced before Maduro took control of the country in 2013 and less than a third of the 3.5 million barrels it was pumping before the Socialist regime took over in 1999.
International sanctions on the Venezuelan government and a deep economic crisis contributed to the decline of the country’s oil industry – but so did a lack of investment and maintenance, according to the EIA. Venezuela’s energy infrastructure is deteriorating, and its capacity to produce oil has been greatly diminished over the years.
That’s a particular problem, because the kind of oil Venezuela is sitting on – heavy, sour crude – requires special equipment and a high level of technical prowess to produce. International oil companies have the capability to extract and refine it, but they’ve been restricted from doing business in the country.
The US government has imposed sanctions on Venezuela since 2005, and the first Trump administration in 2019 effectively blocked all crude exports to the United States from state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela. Then-President Joe Biden in 2022 granted Chevron a permit to operate in Venezuela as part of an effort to lower gas prices – a license Trump revoked in March but later reissued on condition that no proceeds go to the Maduro government.
The United States produces more oil thanany other country in history. But it still needs to import oil – especially the kind that Venezuela produces.
That’s because the United States produces light, sweet crude, which is good for making gasoline but not much else. Heavy, sour crude like the oil from Venezuela is crucial for certain products made in the refining process, including diesel, asphalt and fuels for factories and other heavy equipment. Diesel is in tight supply around the world – in large part because of sanctions on Venezuelan oil.
The United States imported 102,000 barrels per day from Venezuela as of September, according to theEIA. That’s good for the No. 10source of imported oil to the United States – but it pales in comparison to the 254,000 barrels per day imported from Saudi Arabia and 4.1 million from Canada.
For decades, America was far more dependent on Venezuelan oil than it currently is.
Venezuela is nearby and its oil is relatively cheap – a result of its sticky sludgy texture that requires significant refining. Most US refineries were constructed to process Venezuela’s heavy oil, and they’re significantly more efficient when they’re using Venezuelan oil compared to American oil, according to Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.
Opening up Venezuelan oil to the world could benefit the United States and its allies – and, potentially, the Venezuelan economy.
The restrictions on and decimation of Venezuela’s energy industry suggest it could become a much bigger supplier of oil. That could create opportunities for Western oil companies and could serve as a new source of production. It could also keep broader prices in check, although lower prices might disincentivize some US companies from producing oil.
“If we had a legitimate government in Venezuela to run things, that would open up the world to more supply, reducing the risk of price spikes and shortages,” said Flynn. “It would be a huge thing if we could reinvigorate the Venezuelan oil market.”
Even if international access were fully restored tomorrow, it could take years and incredible expense to bring Venezuelan oil production fully back online: PDVSA says its pipelines haven’t been updated in 50 years, and the cost to update the infrastructure to return to peak production levels wouldcost $58 billion.
If a friendlier government to the West came into power in Venezuela, that enormous cost may be worth paying – not only for oil and refinery companies’ profits, but for geopolitics as well.
For example, Russian oil is similar to Venezuela’s, which is why India and China remain so dependent on it despite international sanctions designed to cripple the country’s ability to fund its war in Ukraine. Adding capacity to Venezuelan production could provide an alternative to Russian oil, weakening Russia’s economy – and its ability to wage war in Ukraine.
The sanctions have also dealt a significant blow to the Venezuelan economy: PDVSA represents the single-largest revenue source for Maduro’s government. Restoring the company to its prior capacity could pay significant dividends to Venezuela.
“It’s really a sad story, and it shows how a regime like that can hurt the Venezuelan people,” Flynn said. “They can make it great again, but they’ve got to get rid of Maduro.”
That’s why some have speculated that oil may be playing a role in the Trump administration’s decision to pressure Maduro. This weekend, Madurosent a letterto OPEC’s secretary general, claiming the Trump administration wants to seize his country’s oil reserves.
“(Oil) is at the heart of the matter,” Colombian PresidentGustavo Petro told CNNin an exclusive interview. “So, that’s a negotiation about oil. I believe that is Trump’s logic.”"
NTSB releases frame-by-frame images of engine separating during deadly UPS crash in Louisville,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/us/ups-plane-crash-ntsb-report,"Nov 20, 2025, 11:20 AM ET","A critical mount that kept the left engine attached to theUPS flight that crashedin Louisville earlier this month failed only moments after the doomed flight broke ground, according to a new report from the National Transportation Safety Board
The report includes stunning frame-by-frame photos of the left engine of three-engined McDonnell Douglas MD-11F separating from the plane and going up and over the wing and igniting a fireball seen in a sequence of six extraordinary new images obtained by investigators.
The three pilots of UPS flight 2976 and 11 people on the groundwere killedwhen the beleaguered jet sliced a half-mile long debris field across a petroleum recycling facility and UPS warehouse, setting off a massive blaze of fire and black smoke visible for miles.
The report highlights fatigue cracks found in the hardware attaching the engine to the wing and symptoms of over-stressing, but more is still to come as the agency conducts its full investigation.
The UPS freighter was a 34-year-old jet and had been in the process of being phased out by the cargo carrier.
The Federal Aviation Administration ultimatelygroundedall MD-11 and MD-11F aircraft until each underwent a thorough inspection. UPS has 26 other MD-11s in their fleet, a company spokesperson told CNN.
Investigators who combed the runway shortly after the crash said they recovered and cleaned hardware from the scene—a pair structural fittings which kept the engine pylon snug to the wing. The fittings—known as lugs—showed signs of fatigue cracking and over-stressing, evidenced by “their 2 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions,” investigators said.
The report also lays out a new timeline of the crash sequence along with new data which showed the plane failed to climb higher than 30 feet above Runway 17 Right at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport.
A witness in the control tower reported the takeoff speed appeared normal for the type of aircraft, but the climb was not. Another witness said the plane stopped climbing and began to lose altitude before rolling to the left, the preliminary report said.
The MD-11 is equipped with three engines: one on each wing and one on the tail. The plane went through some previous maintenance in San Antonio that put it out of commission for six weeks, investigators said. All service records will be reviewed.
The left and right engines of the plane are attached to the underside of pylons that are attached to each wing.
The cockpit voice recorders and the engine and pylon that fell off the airplane’s wing have also been moved to a secure facility, where they are being examined, NTSB investigators said.
The cockpit voice recorder contained two hours and four minutes of “good quality digitally recorded audio,” Inman previously said. The flight data recorder contained 63 hours of data that spanned over 24 flights, including the accident, the NTSB said.
In a rare move, the NTSB drew a parallel to a previous disaster—the 1979 crash of American Airlines Flight 191, in Chicago which killed 271 on board and two on the ground. The plane involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, the forerunner to the MD-11.
During that plane’s takeoff rotation, the left engine, pylon assembly and about three feet of the leading edge of the left wing separated from the plane and fell onto the runway. The plane rolled to the left and crashed.
Multiple specialists in varying factors were deployed to investigate including expertsin air traffic control, human performance, aircraft performance and more.
Notably, the 12-pages of new findings were published just more than two weeks since the November 4 crash, significantly faster than the NTSB’s typical 30-day timeline to put out a preliminary report.
“We appreciate the National Transportation Safety Board’s prompt release of preliminary findings and will fully support the investigation through its conclusion,” UPS said in a statement.
Boeing, which long ago merged with the planes original manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, said, “We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected.”
A final report from the NTSB is expected in 18 to 24 months detailing the probable causes of the crash. The agency does not place blame, but gives further recommendations to improve safety.
CNN’s Lauren Mascarenhas, Chris Isidore, Alaa Elassar, Devon M. Sayers and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.
Correction:This story has been updated to reflect the number of MD-11s in the UPS fleet. It is 26."
Why Costco is suing the Trump administration,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/economy/why-costco-is-suing-trump,"Dec 2, 2025, 5:02 PM ET","Costco just broke ranks with the majority of corporate America,suing the Trump administrationon Friday for allegedly overstepping its authority to impose sweeping tariffs this year — and demanding its money back if the Supreme Court ultimately strikes them down.
The case, which wasargued in the Supreme Courtlast month, revolves around whether President Donald Trump had the legal authority to impose tariffs by citing a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Trump used those powers to push import tax rates as high as 50% on key trading partners, including India and Brazil, andas high as 145%on China earlier this year. In total, the tariffs have cost US importers as much as $90 billion as of late September, according to US Customs and Border Protection figures.
Costco sues US government over tariff refunds ahead of Supreme Court ruling
If the justices find Trump lacked the authority to impose the tariffs, the question then becomes who, besides the five small businesses challenging the Trump administration in the Supreme Court case, would be eligible for a refund and how would that process work? As Justice Amy Coney Barrett pointed out during oral arguments last month, the potential refund process could be“a mess.”
In anticipation of potential refunds, many businesses have been privately requesting extensions from CBP for when their tariff payments will be considered finalized, a process that could take several months to complete because of how complicated the tariff code is. Preventing the tariff payment from settling essentially makes it easier down the road to potentially get a refund.
So why, then, is Costco taking a different, more forceful approach that is so clearly at odds with the administration’s agenda?
Costco’s lawyers wrote in the complaint filed with the Court of International Trade that the wholesale giant, along with many other importers, isn’t automatically guaranteed a refund if the Supreme Court rules against the Trump administration.
Furthermore, the filing claimed CBP denied multiple requests Costco made for finalizing tariff payments.
Trump, who referred to the case in a Truth Social post last month as “LIFE OR DEATH for our Country,” could also take measures to make it more onerous for businesses to get refunds, if it comes down to it.
“The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump’s lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CNN in a statement.
All that is pushing Costco to go the extra mile even if it means putting a target on its back with the administration as a result, said Marc Busch, a professor at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service who studies trade policy and law.
“They’re clearly not convinced that the Supreme Court is going to even speak to the hassle of companies getting a refund or the government organizing a systematic process by which that happens,” he said and fully expects more companies to follow Costco’s lead.
Costco didn’t specify in the filing how much the contested tariffs have cost the company. The wholesale retailer didn’t respond to CNN.
Costco’s strongly worded lawsuit and implied criticism of Trump’s tariffs – claiming they were imposed in a “pell-mell manner … with the markets gyrating in response” – risk putting the company in hot water with the White House.
Amazon learned this the hard way after itreportedly plannedto display how much tariffs were contributing to some items’ prices. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt labeled it a “hostile and political act,” sending shares of the company lower. After an irate Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the e-commerce giant said it would not display tariff-related price increases.
Since then, Amazon and other big-box retailers have mostly avoided actions that could invite a similar confrontation. They’ve also been sittingsilentlyon the sidelines as the tariff case plays out, even though they too have, at a minimum, tens of millions of dollars riding on the outcome of the case.
But sitting on the sidelines bears a cost, too.
If Costco didn’t sue the Trump administration, the company could “be in a position where the tariffs are ruled unlawful, but they still can’t get their money back,” said Emil Stefanutti, CEO of Gaia Dynamics, an AI-powered trade compliance platform.
“For a company their size, that could mean absorbing very high, potentially unrecoverable costs.”"
Wall Street soars on record bank profits and cooling inflation,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/15/investing/us-stocks-inflation-bank-earnings,,"US stocks surged higher Wednesday afteran encouraging inflation reportand blockbuster profits for some of America’s biggest banks.
The Dow surged 703 points, or 1.65%, to close at 43,222. The S&P 500 rose 1.83% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended the day higher by 2.45%.
The closing bell concluded a rally on Wall Street that has helped all three major indices recover losses and post overall gains since the start of 2025.
Stocks had started the day on a strong note, with the Dow almost 700 points higher immediately after the latest inflation snapshot was released. Data showed a slowdown in the core measure of the Consumer Price Index for the first time in months, rising just 0.2% from November and easing to 3.2% year over year after staying stuck at 3.3% since September 2024.
That’s an improvement despite headline consumer prices rising 2.9% year-over-year in December, edging up from 2.7% the month before, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday.
“We believe the market will be encouraged by the decrease in core inflation, which should alleviate some of the pressure on stock and bond markets, both of which have had a poor start to the year on inflation fears and concerns the Federal Reserve would not only stop cutting interest rates, but could even reverse course and begin raising them,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, in a note.
The VIX, Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell more than 13% on Wednesday as investors felt a moment of relief.
“While volatility could make it an uncomfortable journey before the S&P 500 hits our year-end target of 6,600, we expect the equity bull market to continue,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Wednesday.
Robust bank earnings for the fourth quarter are a positive signal for the wellbeing of the biggest players in US financial markets ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) posted arecord annual profit of $58.5 billion, hauling in $14 billion in net income in the fourth quarter as an environment of lower interest rates and post-election market volatility proved profitable for the bank.
“Businesses are more optimistic about the economy, and they are encouraged by expectations for a more pro-growth agenda and improved collaboration between government and business,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in a statement.
Goldman Sachs (GS) also posted strong earnings on Wednesday, recording $4.11 billion in profit in thefourth quarter, more than double its profit in thefourth quarter of 2023.
Citi (C) posted a $2.9 billion profit in thefourth quarter of 2024compared with a $1.8 billion loss in thefourth quarter of 2023. That was “primarily driven by the higher revenues, lower expenses and lower cost of credit,” according to a press release. Shares of Citigroup rose by about 6.49%.
Wells Fargo (WFC) stock rose by 6.69% Wednesday after beating expectations and recording a $5.1 billion profit in thefourth quarter of 2024, up from$3.4 billionin the same period a year prior.
“Our number one stock idea for 2025 is long investment banks due to a likely boom in both M&A and AI related IPOs,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO and CIO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, in an email.
BlackRock (BLK), the world’s largest asset management firm, reported a fourth-quarter profit of$1.67 billion, up 21% from the same period a year prior. BlackRock’s assets under management in 2024 increased to a record $11.55 trillion, up 15% from the previous year. BlackRock stock was up 5.19% Wednesday.
The 10-year Treasury yield edged lower as the bond market digested the improvement in core inflation, highlighting just how nervous some investors were about the potential for a rise in inflation.
The slide in yields is welcome news for the stock market, where investors were recently worried that rising yields would pull money out of stocks and toward bonds.
“Any further pullback in yields would be a constructive tailwind for stocks and the S&P 500,” Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, said in a note.
Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, said he suspects the bond and stock market reactions could fade. “These aren’t good numbers,” Brusuelas said of the inflation report. “The bond market is very skittish right now. And they are prone to overreaction.”
After ablowout jobs reporton Friday, Wall Street adjusted its expectations for fewer rate cuts from the Fed in 2025 than previously expected. Yet there is anything but consensus across the big banks.
Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note Wednesday that he thinks Wednesday’s inflation report is consistent with a rate cut from the Fed in March.
“Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump,” Gapen said.
Meanwhile, Bank of America Global Research maintains its view that the Fed is done cutting rates.
“Today’s CPI print reduces the risk of imminent hikes … But it doesn’t move the needle on our view that the Fed cutting cycle is over,” said Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at Bank of America Global Research, in a Wednesday note.
UBS’ Marcelli said in a Wednesday note that rate cuts from the Fed “are still on the table” as she expects inflation to continue to moderate.
The price of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, surged more than 3% to surpass $82 a barrel and hit its highest price since August 2024. Futures on WTI crude, the US benchmark, surged about 3.65% and briefly crossed $80 a barrel for the first time since August. Oil prices have increased significantly since the end of 2024, a rally that could meaningfully lift gasoline prices and raise concerns about inflation.
Late last week, President Joe Bidenimposed some of the toughest sanctions yeton Russia’s oil industry, adding to the upward pressure on energy prices.

The cracks in Trump’s base,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/06/politics/donald-trump-republicans-base-divide,"Dec 6, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","No politician in modern history has held as much sway over his base asPresident Donald Trump. And perhaps nothing has mattered more to his political career than that.
Whenever Trump’s been down – such as after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot or after he was indicted four times – he’s been able to count on his base to keep him relevant and in the game. Republicans’ fear of crossing Trump is perhaps the animating principle in the party, and it’s allowed him to plow through any number of controversies that would have sunk pretty much any other politician.
But more than ever, that’s starting to change. We’ve seen cracks in Trump’s base for a while. And they’re starting to widen.
It’s not just Rep.Marjorie Taylor Greeneof Georgia who seems to be balking at at least some of what she’s seeing.
In fact, a number of recent polls have shown 1 in 5 Republicans or more disapproving of Trump on a range of issues. Sometimes, those numbers stretch much higher, and even around majority territory.
It hasn’t pulled down his overall approval rating among Republicans much, but it suggests that the base isn’t so unflinchingly in his corner anymore.
Here are the key issues.
It’s difficult to find an issue on which Republicans have been less pleased with Trump. Few polls have shown even half of them approving. But generally speaking, they’ve chosen the neutral option.
A recentReuters-Ipsos poll, for example, showed31%of Republicans disapproved of Trump on the issue, compared to 44% who approved and 25% who chose neither option.
But when you get more people to choose, things look considerably worse. A recentMarquette University Law School pollactually showed a majority of Republicans –54%– disapproved of Trump’s handling of “information about Jeffrey Epstein.”
This is probably Trump’s most significant problem, because of how much people care about it.
His disapproval rating among Republicans in recent polls has generally been pegged around 1 in 4. It was at24%in aYahoo News-YouGov poll,25%in aCBS News-YouGov polland26%in the Reuters-Ipsos poll.
But that number spiked to﻿39%in the Marquette poll.
And there’s reason to believe these numbers might actually undersell Trump’s problem with the base here. After all, recent CBS polling showed a majority of Republicans –57%– say the administration hasn’t focused enough on lowering the cost of goods and services. That’s certainly a form of disapproval.
Also tellingly: Trump’s disapproval rating among Republicans on the broader issue of the economy has also climbed. It was as high as22%in aFox News polland32%in anAP-NORC poll.
This hasn’t gotten much attention. But it’s amazing that Democrats haven’t made more an issue of it.
GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky recently wagered that Trump spending tens of billions of dollars to bail out Argentina’s government could be a “deal-breaker” with the MAGA base. After all, it’s about the polar opposite of “America First.”
And he seems to have a point.
The Marquette poll found that a whopping69%of Republicans disapproved of Trump “providing $20-$40 billion to help stabilize Argentina’s economy.”
It’s one poll, and it’d be good to get more data. But the idea that 7 in 10 Republicans could disapprove of Trump on anything in any poll would once have been unthinkable.
Trump’s problems here are many.
For one, he promised to end the war on Day One and has decidedly failed to live up to that. For another, he’s generally catered to Russia in a way that makes hawkish Republicans uncomfortable – including with his recent ceasefire plan thatlooked as if it were written by Moscow.
His disapproval rating among Republicans on this issue has ranged from23%in a recentGallup pollall the way up to40%in the Marquette poll.
Trump’s focus on foreign matters in general seems to be a problem with some Republicans who prefer he’d turn his focus to his own country. For instance, the same Gallup poll showed22%﻿disapproved of Trump’s handling of the situation in the Middle East – this despite the recent ceasefire deal in Gaza.
This one might be surprising to some people. But it’s looking like Democrats’ efforts to focus the government shutdown debate on Obamacare subsidies has paid off.
Trump is seeingsome of his worst numbersto date on health care – about as bad as when the GOP tried to pass a very unpopular Obamacare repeal bill in 2017.
His disapproval rating among Republicans on health care has registered at19%(Reuters),21%(Gallup),26%(Fox News), and all the way up to32%in the AP-NORC poll.
This has been a sleeping giant of an issue for Trump.Pew Research Center pollingshowed the percentage of Republicans who said Trump was making the federal government work better dropped from76%in February to55%in August.
And the government shutdown doesn’t appear to have helped.
The AP-NORC poll conducted in early November showed32%of Republicans disapproved of how Trump was handling the federal government. The Marquette poll showed nearly half –48%– disapproved of Trump’s handling of the shutdown.
All of these are cracks in the base. Whether they ultimately cause Republicans to flee is another question. But it’s clear we’re seeing cracks in a way we rarely have before."
World’s top 100 cities revealed — Los Angeles and Orlando climb the rankings,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/travel/euromonitor-international-top-city-destinations-2025,"Dec 4, 2025, 1:15 PM ET","What’sla plus bellecity of all the world, enticing more than 18 million visitors in 2025 alone?
Paris has just been named the most attractive city in the world for the fifth time in a row. The French capital has once again comfortably taken No. 1 spot in the Top 100 City Destinations Index by data analytics companyEuromonitor International.
This was another boom year for visitors to the City of Light, thanks to the newly reopenedNotre Dameand the influx of soccer fans coming to see the trophy after Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) won theChampions League titlefor the first time.
The metropolis was more than prepared, thanks to its tourism policy and infrastructure, the report said.
The index looks at leading cities from around the world and ranks them on criteria including tourism, sustainability, economic performance and health and safety.
Once again, Europe dominates the 2025 rankings with six cities in the top 10. Madrid is at No. 2, Rome and Milan are at No. 4 and No. 5, Amsterdam is at No. 7 and Barcelona has climbed two places at No. 8.
London, which last year dropped out of the top 10 to No. 13, has continued its downward trajectory. It’s now at No. 18 on the list, between Hong Kong at No. 17 and Kyoto at No. 19.
While London ranked No. 4 globally for tourism infrastructure, it lagged in tourism policy, health and safety, and sustainability.
Asia-Pacific performed well, with Tokyo at No. 3, Singapore at No. 9 and Seoul climbing up to No. 10. Tokyo was also No. 3 in the world for tourism infrastructure, a position the city is cementing with big investments in its Narita International Airport. Plans include a third runway and the extension of the second, which is expected to double passenger capacity by 2039.
New York, once again ranking at No. 6, is the only American city in the top 10. Los Angeles, which has climbed five places to No. 13, is the next highest. Orlando, Florida, led the world for tourism performance, with strong domestic travel at the heart of that. This was fueled by the opening of the Epic Universe theme park at Universal Orlando Resort in May 2025, as well as big upgrades at Sea World and Disney World. Orlando also hosted six FIFA Club World Cup matches this year.
Bangkok is once again the top city for tourism policy and attractiveness and once again the No.1 city worldwide in 2025 for international arrivals. Euromonitor International estimates a whopping 30.3 million international trips there in 2025.
Hong Kong is at No. 2 for international arrivals, with 23.2 million estimated trips. London is at No. 3, with 22.7 million, and Macao (the gambling hot spot dubbed the “Chinese Vegas”) is at No. 4, with 20.4 million.
Euromonitor International notes several trends for 2025. To tackle the problem of overtourism, cities are reframing their tourism strategies to focus on value, not volume. That means targeting visitors who stay longer, spend more and engage more responsibly with the local environment and culture.
“Rising security concerns, growing tourism flows, overtourism and inflationary pressures” are behind the decision by several destinations to revise entry fees and speed up the adoption of electronic travel authorization systems, says Euromonitor International, which will influence the long-term tourism appeal of cities.
In 2025, the UK and the US both raised their charges, while the EU is preparing to introduce its European Travel Authorization System next year with abumped-up fee. Japan is also considering a suite of changes, including higher visa fees and a new electronic travel authorization system, which could launch by 2028."
Netflix’s $72 billion Hollywood bet: What you need to know,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/business/netflix-hollywood-bet-faq,"Dec 5, 2025, 3:03 PM ET","This is a David and Goliath story – with a twist. Almost exactly 15 years ago today the owner of Warner Bros. and HBO pushed back on Hollywood and Wall Street hype about a streaming upstart named Netflix.
The 2010 quote from Jeff Bewkes in The New York Times is now infamous: “It’s a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don’t think so.”
Well, as LightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield said Friday, “the Albanian army just took over the world.”
Here’s what you need to know about Netflix’s $72 billion deal for Warner Bros. and HBO.
Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN, is moving forward with its plans to split into two publicly traded companies.
Once the split takes effect, likely sometime next summer, Netflix intends to acquire the Warner half. The other half, Discovery Global, will house CNN and other channels.
Netflix, already the streaming king, says “this acquisition will improve our offering and accelerate our business for decades to come.”
But first, Netflix has to convince governments around the world to OK to deal. The regulatory review process is going to take a long time – in the US, EU and elsewhere.
Most people who have the HBO Max streaming service also have Netflix. It is unclear what will happen to HBO Max, but history suggests that it will be folded into Netflix’s service in one way or another.
Netflix says that “by adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.”
Some lawmakers and regulatory experts are already expressing concern that Netflix will pass along higher costs to consumers.
Warner Bros. Discovery put itself up for sale a couple of months ago after Paramount made unsolicited bids for the entire company. Then Netflix and Comcast emerged as rival bidders for the studio and streaming assets.
Paramount was thought to be the frontrunner in the auction. Paramount CEO David Ellison’s allies exuded confidence about their merger proposal – and their mutually beneficial relationship with President Donald Trump. But things clearly changed in recent days.
Paramount’s December 3 letter to the WBD board expressing “grave concerns” about the auction process was a possible precursor to a hostile-takeover play.
Officially, Paramount is not commenting on the Netflix deal. Unofficially, Paramount is plotting how to fight back.
Every mega-deal like this gets closely scrutinized. This one probably more so.
On Friday CNBC quoted an anonymous senior administration official saying the Trump administration is viewing the deal with “heavy skepticism.”
Netflix’s plans could be held up for months, and even years, in Washington, DC, either by Trump loyalists carrying out his wishes or by bureaucrats with genuine objections to media consolidation.
Trump can make the process more painful, but he does not get a literal veto. Remember when the Justice Department in 2017 sued to stop AT&T’s acquisition of the aforementioned Time Warner? The companies fought the case in court and prevailed.
Netflix seems willing to stomach a similar legal battle. Or, at the very least, willing to go through the motions – and keep Warner Bros. out of Paramount’s and Comcast’s hands for a long while.
Indeed, the Trump administration intervention in 2017 had the effect of slowing down HBO at a time when it desperately needed to speed up its competition with Netflix.
Also: The US is just one of many markets that will take a close look at the transaction. European regulators also will have a lot to say.
Netflix will argue that it’s really not a Goliath at all, not in a Big Tech environment comprised of players like Google and Amazon.
Netflix views Google’s YouTube as a primary rival for attention now, and for good reason, given that YouTube viewership has been growing by leaps and bounds.
“With Google increasingly entering the market, this deal may serve as a strategic blocking and tackling maneuver,” Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, pointed out.
Netflix will also claim that it is creating “more opportunities for the creative community,” though many in Hollywood won’t buy that.
More practically, people on Netflix’s side might say that further industry consolidation is inevitable, given changing consumer habits and shifting business models for old-line media companies.
WBD is moving ahead with its breakup plan, which means that CNN will become part of a newly formed company called Discovery Global next year.
Channels like TNT, Discovery and free-to-air channels across Europe will also be part of Discovery Global. And they’ll operate separately from Warner Bros., which is the side of the house that Netflix intends to buy.
“We’ll continue to work with future Discovery Global CEO Gunnar Wiedenfels and the rest of his team to make sure that the new company gets off to a flying start,” CNN CEO Mark Thompson said in a memo on Friday.
Thompson said both WBD CEO David Zaslav and Wiedenfels “are firm backers” of CNN’s strategy, including the recent rollout of theCNN All Accesssubscription service. “We’ve already agreed to a 2026 budget which includes increased investment for the plan,” Thompson said."

"Hollywood, already on shaky economic ground, shudders at the prospect of a mega-Netflix",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/business/hollywood-netflix-warner-bros-deal,"Dec 5, 2025, 4:38 PM ET","The business of Hollywood was in trouble long before theearth-rattling newsthat Netflix had inked a $72 billion takeover of Warner Bros. And while the deal is widely seen as a coup by Netflix, once a scrappy startup that had to fight to be taken seriously, it also threatens to further shrink the industry and raise prices for consumers.
Producers, actors, writers and theater owners are not thrilled about the prospect of a mega-Netflix dominating show business, with major unions and trade groups expressing deep concern about the potential impact on jobs and communities.
“The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the Writers Guild of America, the union representing Hollywood writers,saidFriday. “The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers.”
Netflix triumphed over Paramount and Comcast late Thursday in a bidding war for Warner Bros., surprising many in the industry who saw Paramount as a shoo-in.
“Holy f—k. Netflix got WBD,” one Paramount staffer said in a text to CNN on Thursday night.
Netflix announces deal to buy Warner Bros. and HBO
David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN’s parent company, attributed the decision to “the realities of an industry undergoing generational change.”
The entertainment industry has experienced a series of upheavals in recent years. Studio consolidation accelerated in the late 2010s, leading to fewer projects being greenlit for production. The Covid-19 pandemic halted production for months, pushing studios to delay or cancel projects, leaving thousands out of work. Movie theaters faced an existential crisis during lockdowns, and have yet to reach pre-Covid audience levels. At the same time, TV and film productions have been increasingly moved out of the United States entirely to take advantage of lower labor costs and tax incentives.
All of that has rapidly shrunk the entertainment economy. Now, many worry the proposed Netflix deal will further erode their job security.
“Producers are rightfully concerned” about the potential deal, the Producers Guild of America said in a statement. “Our legacy studios are more than content libraries — within their vaults are the character and culture of our nation.”
SAG-AFTRA, Hollywood’s biggest actors union, also expressed concern about the potential deal, saying it raises “many serious questions” about the future of the entertainment industry, “especially the human creative talent whose livelihoods and careers depend on it.”
Theater owners, in particular, dread the idea of negotiating future film releases with the company that built its business partly on bypassing theaters to bring original content directly to viewers. The big screen would face “an unprecedented threat,” according to Cinema United, a trade association that represents more than 30,000 movie screens in the United States.
“Netflix’s stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition,” Cinema United President and CEO Michael O’Leary said in astatement. “In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.”
Netflix has been pushing back on that argument.
“We’ve released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it’s not like we have this opposition to movies in theaters,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a call with Wall Street analysts Friday. “My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long, exclusive windows, which we don’t really think are that consumer-friendly.”
He added: “Right now, you should count on everything that is planned on going to the theater through Warner Bros. will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros.”
Netflix only occasionally releases its films to theaters to meet the criteria for Oscar nominations. Its business model has always been based on maintaining a giant library of movies and TV shows that viewers can access anywhere, anytime.
By acquiring Warner Bros., Netflix would gain access to some of Hollywood’s most beloved and lucrative titles, including “Batman” and “Harry Potter,” as well as a deep, 100-year-old library of Hollywood classics like “Casablanca” and “The Wizard of Oz.” At the same time, it would control decades’ worth of network TV shows like “Friends” along with all of HBO’s prestige programming, such as “Game of Thrones.”
On top of all that, the deal would effectively allow Netflix, the streaming king, to wipe out its second-largest competitor after Disney: HBO Max.
“This is not a win for consumers,” Ross Benes, a senior analyst at eMarketer, told CNN. “Netflix has already aggressively raised prices, increased ad load, and stopped people from sharing passwords. Absorbing a competitor with strong content will only lead to its service becoming more expensive and give consumers less choice.”
It could also be bad news for the tens of thousands of workers employed by the film and TV industry. Benes said the deal would likely lead to layoffs and reduce the number of companies willing to spend heavily on TV and movies.
“This contracts the industry,” he said, while noting that the deal is far from done.
On Thursday,as news emergedthat Netflix was the top bidder for Warner Bros., an anonymous group of “concerned feature film producers” sent an open letter to Congress, warning of a potential economic and institutional “meltdown in Hollywood” if Netflix were to succeed, according toVariety.
The filmmakers argued that Netflix would “effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace.”
Paramount, on the other hand, took a different approach in its bid for Warner Bros., wooing talent with a theater-forward strategy.
Despite changes in the entertainment landscape, creative talent both in front of and behind the camera are eager for audiences to experience their work in theaters — not from the couch. It’s one of the reasons why Netflix’s top creators, the Duffer Brothers — best known for writing and producing the series “Stranger Things” — are jumping shipfrom Netflix to Paramount.
Paramount has also inked deals with some of the biggest names in movies over the past few months, including Tom Cruise, Will Smith, “Wicked” director John M. Chu and director James Mangold."

India air travel chaos eases but IndiGo crisis still leaves hundreds stranded,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/asia/indigo-india-air-travel-mumbai-intl-hnk,"Dec 5, 2025, 9:21 PM ET","Crowds at Indian airports eased on Saturday but hundreds of passengers were still gathering outside Bengaluru and Mumbai airports as 385 IndiGo flights were canceled, in the fifth day of a crisis that has hit the country’s biggest airline.
Air travel across India has been in turmoil this week after IndiGo canceled thousands of flights, prompting the government to announce special relief for the carrier and operate some trains to help clear the backlog.
It is the biggest crisis ever for the 20-year-old airline, which long prided itself on on-time performance and lured passengers with low-cost fares.
IndiGo has admitted it failed to plan properly ahead of a November 1 deadline to implement stricter rules for pilots around night flying and weekly rest, which ultimately led to problems around roster planning this week.
On Friday, more than 1,000 IndiGo flights were canceled. The Delhi airport in a post on X said flight operations are steadily resuming, but some IndiGo flights continue to be affected.
Everyone agrees drunk plane passengers are a problem. Nobody agrees on how to fix it
Airport sources told Reuters 124 IndiGo flights in Bengaluru have been canceled on Saturday, 109 in Mumbai, 86 in New Delhi and 66 in Hyderabad.
India’s government has made special relaxations to the rules for the airline, and IndiGo has said it could return to normalcy between December 10-15.
Still, hundreds of passengers gathered outside Bengaluru and Mumbai airports on Saturday, with some clueless about their cancellations, according to Reuters photographers present at the scene.
Satish Konde had to catch a connecting flight to go to the city of Nagpur from Mumbai, and was checked in, but was told later it was canceled.
“I am waiting for my luggage to be returned,” he told Reuters at the airport.
Other major Indian airlines, including Air India and Akasa, have not had to cancel flights due to the new rules."
"How Trump’s AI push, energy prices and angry neighbors are colliding in the Arizona desert",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/politics/data-center-arizona-kyrsten-sinema-trump,"Dec 10, 2025, 6:01 AM ET","Andy and Carrie Hoefer knew little about data centers until a notice arrived informing them that one might be built across the street from their condominium complex.
Only then did they make a startling discovery: Ten data centers already operate in the area around their home.
“Do we really need 11?” Andy Hoefer asked.
The city of Chandler has spent years wrestling with that question, just as communities around the country debate the economic and environmental trade-offs of these hulking, resource-intensive warehouses of servers and other IT equipment that power everything from streaming services to online banking
In battleground Arizona and beyond, thepolitics of data centersare unsettled, not falling neatly along partisan lines. And President Donald Trump has injected himself into the fights, throwing thefull weightof his administration behindwinning the artificial intelligence raceby whatever means possible — including fast-tracking data centers.
Chandler, for its part, decided three years ago it didn’t need another data center. After a decade of noise complaints and rising worries about dwindling water supplies and surging electric bills, Chandler became one of the first cities in the country to adopt restrictions designed to make opening data centers far more difficult. The ordinance sent a clear signal to certain technology companies to rethink expansion in the fast-growing Phoenix suburb.
Now, a developer has proposed a facility that is expected to be more powerful than any data center already operating in Chandler. The company argues the project — a $2.5 billion technology park anchored by a data center as long as a football field and seven stories high — would position the city at the forefront of an artificial intelligence boom, attracting new businesses and bringing renewed prestige to one of the state’s most dynamic technological engines.
Chandler city staff have recommended against it, warning data centers historically bring few jobs and many complications. The developer, however, has enlisted a high-profile advocate: former Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, aDemocrat-turned-independentwho is closely aligned with Trump’s AI offensive. Sinema recently cautioned city officials that the Trump administration might someday force a data center on them if they block this one. The City Council is scheduled to vote on the measure Thursday.
Residents are pushing back. Emails opposing the new data center outnumber supporters by more than 20-to-1, according to a City Council memo. Andy Hoefer, a 65-year-old financial planner, designed and sent more than 2,000 post cards to neighbors to raise awareness, while Carrie, a 63-year-old registered nurse, knocked on hundreds of doors to rally opposition.
“I’m not against AI; I think it’s great,” she said. “But I don’t want to become a subject in a future study on what it’s like to live in such close proximity to so many data centers.”
Chandler didn’t set out to become a data center hub. Once covered in cattle, cotton and ostrich farms, the valley city’s population exploded after Intel opened a production facility in 1980. Other blue-chip businesses, such as Wells Fargo, Northrop Grumman and Microchip Technology, followed. Chandler is now a key cog in the rise of Arizona’s Silicon Desert.
Then, a developer’s post-Great Recession plan to turn an old Motorola facility into a 152-acre technology park didn’t materialize. The initial proposal called for just one data center, former City Councilmember Rick Heumann said, but when tenants didn’t arrive, more data centers filled the empty land. By 2023, when the city’s new rules on data centers went into effect, 10 had set up in Chandler’s main corporate corridor.
“There’s like no jobs to speak of,” Heumann said, bristling at the fortified structures as he drove by on a recent Thursday morning.
The city estimates that the tech park employs fewer than 100 people and that data centers in general bring “extremely low employment per square foot” compared with other industries, Chandler staff wrote in one presentation.
Cepand Alizadeh, the government relations director for the pro-data center Arizona Technology Council, argued that these facilities create thousands of construction jobs and that the full-time positions offer competitive salaries and attractive benefits.
“For every one job at a data center, six other jobs are created in a local ecosystem,” Alizadeh said.
For years, residents complained of droning sounds coming from the facilities. Abatement efforts have lessened the burden, but locals still chime in on neighborhood Facebook groups when these facilities loudly test their backup generators. The local electric utility, Salt River Project, built additional substations and utility lines nearby just to service the data centers. Concerns about water used to cool these buildings habitually arose in the desert community.
But Adam Baugh, an Arizona attorney representing the project, says it’s unfair to compare their proposal for an artificial intelligence data center to those already operating in the city. This one, they contend, will attract companies eager to set up shop next to their cutting-edge technology, and they’ve promised to build five additional structures to house future tenants.
“Calling this a data center is like comparing a Walkman and an iPhone and saying they’re both musical devices,” Baugh recently told the city. He did not respond to emails from CNN.
The developer of the new project, Jeff Zygler of ActiveInfrastructure, did not respond to a request for comment.
Already this year, the data center debate has echoed through statehouses and shaped key races. Georgia voters last month ousted two Republicans from the state utility board in response to soaring electric rates blamed in part on data centers. That same night, Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger vowed to “make sure that data centers pay their fair share” in her victory speech.
Both parties anticipate the issue will surface in the midterm elections as Democrats sharpen their message on rising power bills and other affordability challenges and as Republicans brace for an electorate increasingly attuned to the costs of Trump’s AI agenda.
The politics around data centers are “still emerging,” in part because hyperscalers are so new and developers are rushing to build them in so many places, said Harvard University sociology professor Jason Beckfield, who is studying data centers.
“A lot of people feel like these things drop from the sky,” Beckfield told CNN. “The developers are under huge pressure to get these things done as fast as humanly possible.”
Data centers like the one proposed in Chandler are a key pillar of Trump’s plan to beat China and become the leading AI superpower. Under an AI action plan released in July, the White House recommended easing federal rules and expediting permits to construct data centers.
Against that backdrop, Sinema recently raised eyebrows by suggesting Chandler’s choices in the future may be limited.
“Federal preemption is coming,” she said at the city’s October zoning meeting. “Chandler right now has the opportunity to determine how and when these new, innovative AI data centers will be built. When federal preemption comes, you will no longer have that privilege.”
Sinema introduced herself as the co-chair of the newly formed AI Infrastructure Coalition, an industry group she founded shortly after leaving Congress. She told CNN she has a contract with the company building the Chandler project, a fact she didn’t share during her public remarks. Emails obtained by CNN through a public records request show Sinema meeting with city leaders to discuss the data center since midsummer.
The former Arizona senator told the board she works “hand in glove with the Trump administration,” and her remarks were widely interpreted as a threat from Washington. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Her appearance attracted local news coverage and seemed to intensify opposition. In emails sent to City Hall after the zoning meeting, residents repeatedly referenced Sinema’s statements and some told CNN they weren’t aware of the data center project before her involvement became publicized.
“It wasn’t a threat, it was a promise,” said Councilmember OD Harris. “People are fired up over this now, and they’re fired up because of Sen. Sinema. She shouldn’t have come.”
Cities are increasingly concerned that Sinema foreshadowed a looming fight. Trump’s allies are already laying the groundwork for his administration to overrule local rules to build the infrastructure supporting AI expansion, said Angelina Panettieri, who tracks technology legislation for the National League of Cities. In pushing ahead with Trump’s AI action plan, the Federal Communications Commission, for example, has discussed whether cities and counties have regulations that “could inhibit U.S. leadership in evolving technologies like artificial intelligence.”
In an interview this week, Sinema said her remarks have been misconstrued.
“I believe in local control,” she said.
Tech companies’ race to dominate artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming communities across the nation.
Virginia has the biggest data center cluster in not just the US, but the entire world. Texas and Ohio are becoming major hubs, too. But tech companies are looking west — increasingly, toward Arizona.
The state’s desert landscape, although punishingly hot, is relatively flat and not prone to disasters like hurricanes, floods or earthquakes. It’s also financially attractive: A generous state tax credit exempts companies from paying state or local taxes on their computer equipment inside the buildings.
But local officials are growing increasingly uncomfortable with the energy and resource demands from data centers. Arizona is a water-scarce state whose share of the Colorado River is dwindling at the same time farms are pumpingvast amounts of groundwaterto grow vegetables and forage crops in the desert.
Some data centers use water to cool their stacks of overheating computer servers, but companies — including the builder behind the Chandler project — are more likely to propose “dry cooling,” essentially using air conditioning instead of water. That may be good news for water resources, but it means data centers need even more electricity to keep cool.
Trump has publicly suggested that US energy production will have to double to meet the demands to win America’s AI race against other nations. A2024 report by the US Department of Energy estimated that data centers would consume between 6.7% and 12% of the nation’s electricity by 2028.
The two major utilities serving Arizona acknowledged receiving eye-popping electricity requests from data centers. As demand has increased, so too have Arizona’s electricity prices. One utility, Arizona Public Service, this summer asked the Arizona Corporation Commission to approve a 16% rate hike.
There is mounting consumer frustration that price spikes are connected to the data centers. Arizona Public Service spokesperson Ann Porter said the requested rate hike “doesn’t include costs of infrastructure that might be needed to be built in the future to serve data center customers.” Industry groups have contended electric prices are rising everywhere, even in places without data centers.
Still, utilities are now charging tech companies up-front for the massive amounts of electricity they want to use to ensure residents aren’t stuck with the bill. For the proposed data center in Chandler, the Salt River Project, the local utility, is requiring the developer to pay $242 million to cover the costs to build additional capacity.
The amount of electricity data centers are requesting is nearly equivalent to the Salt River Project’s current power capacity, said utility spokesperson Jennifer Schuricht — and it will take building new power plants and infrastructure to satisfy it.
Forecasting how much energy to plan for is an inexact science — especially when the estimates from data centers appear to be wildly inflated, said Kelly Barr, associate vice president at Arizona State University’s Global Futures Laboratory and a former executive at the Salt River Project. And in Arizona, where air conditioners are the difference between life and death during summer months, the consequences of guessing wrong are dire.
Ensuring the grid runs reliably is utilities’ “top priority,” Barr said.
“If that means data centers are served a bit later, then that’s simply what has to happen,” she added.
A 6-foot wall is all that separates Patrick Griffith’s backyard from his city’s explosive growth.
Through triple-pane windows, the 61-year-old retired insurance adjuster can still hear the traffic from a road leading to an ever-expanding Intel plant. His ficus tree can’t fully hide the power lines that send electricity across the desert into power-hungry tech hubs. Some nights, the stench from a nearby water treatment plant spoils plans to dine on his patio.
But it’s the data center planned for across the street from his wall that may finally push him out of his two-story home after three decades.
“My wife has been ready to go for some time,” Griffith said. “If they build this, I may give in.”
While outnumbered, advocates for the project are quietly hoping for success. Chris Tiller, a local real estate agent, is worried the city is too committed to an aging model dependent on large corporations building massive offices on vacant land.
“It’s 2026. Adapt or die,” Tiller said at a recent City Hall listening session on data centers.
Zygler, the developer, has not in public remarks identified prospective users of the data center or the companies that might move next door. Zygler also could not point to a similar project operating in the state, though he said two are under construction. That worries some city officials who remember the last decade all too well.
“I’ve asked them: ‘Can you tell me this is not a ‘Field of Dreams’ scenario where you build it and hope they come?’” said Councilmember Matt Orlando. “If they want a vote from me, they need to give me some answers.”"
Images of Trump appearing to close his eyes during Oval Office event spread across social media,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/08/politics/trump-oval-office-event,"Nov 8, 2025, 8:24 PM ET","Images of Donald Trump appearing to close his eyes at an Oval Office announcement this week rocketed around social media this weekend, with the president’s opponents seizing on the footage to raise questions about Trump’s on-the-job performance.
Trump was participating in an announcement Thursdayabout cutting pricesfor popular weight-loss drugs, speaking from behind the Resolute Desk alongside other officials.
At moments, Trump’s eyes appeared closed, and at others he seemed to struggle to keep them open. He rubbed his eyes at points.
The images drew swift criticism from Trump’s critics. The press office for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the president’s top foils, posted images from the event and wrote: “DOZY DON IS BACK.”
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CNN that “the President was not sleeping; in fact, he spoke throughout and took many questions from the press during this announcement which represents a historic reduction in prices for Americans on two drugs that help Americans struggling with diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other conditions. This announcement by President Trump will save a significant amount of money and countless American lives, and yet the failing, liberal media want to push a garbage narrative instead of covering it.”
Trump appears in public regularly and participates in lengthy question-and-answer sessions with reporters. Aides and Cabinet members routinely praise his stamina and describe receiving phone calls or messages from him at all hours.
A day before Thursday’s event, Trump traveled to Miami for an economic speech that lasted more than an hour. He also completed a three-nation swing through Asia at the end of last month.
Still, questions about Trump’s health have persisted since he took office as the oldest man ever inaugurated to the job. The 79-year-old president said last month thathe received an MRIduring a physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center without saying why.
Over the summer, the White House announced that doctors examined Trump for swelling in his legs anddiagnosed himwith chronic venous insufficiency. It’s a condition in which valves inside certain veins don’t work the way they should, which can allow blood to pool or collect in the veins.
All presidents, at moments, have appeared tired in public. Even a much younger president like Barack Obama would occasionally rub fatigued eyes during long summits.
Trump has harshly criticized former President Joe Biden for a lack of vigor, labeling him “Sleepy Joe” in last year’s election and continuing to use the moniker. Biden, the oldest president in history, was also seen at moments closing his eyes during public events."

​​Does scandal sell? Not for Olivia Nuzzi’s book so far,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/us/olivia-nuzzi-american-canto-release-cec,"Dec 3, 2025, 11:50 AM ET","The news that Olivia Nuzzi had a book coming out was, in political and journalistic circles, the sensation of the fall season.
In October of 2024, Nuzzi hadlost her postat New York Magazine, where she’d been a star profiler of politicians, when it turned out she had been having an affair (passionate, but purportedly never physically consummated) with one of her profile subjects: the independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Afterward, Kennedy went on to become the secretary of Health and Human Services for Donald Trump, while Nuzzi went into what journalistic cliche and short attention spans decided to call “exile.”
Eleven months later, she was back: announced by Vanity Fair as the magazine’s new West Coast editor. Less than a month after that, she was inThe New York Times, on the receiving end of a celebrity profile, complete with romantic, black-and-white visuals of her driving through California in a convertible, blonde hair blowing in the wind — and with the word that she had turned her career-upending romance into a memoir, “American Canto,” coming soon.
Then came an excerpt of the book inVanity Fair, followed by a furious serialized barrage of Substack blogging from her scorned ex-fiancé and fellow political reporter,Ryan Lizza, accusing her of even more journalistic and sexual transgressions, all of which was met with the anticipation and discourse once reserved for Sunday night prestige cable programming. (Lizza was previously an on-air contributor to CNN.)
On Tuesday, the book arrived in stores. At lunchtime, in the Midtown Manhattan nexus of media and publishing, interest in Nuzzi’s story seemed more muted. The Barnes and Noble on Fifth Avenue had seven copies tucked into a “New & Notable” rack next to the escalator, below Malala Yousafzai’s “Finding My Way.” Not many had sold so far, a store employee said.
A few blocks uptown, at a branch of the local independent chain McNally Jackson Books, a few volumes lay on a table of new and noteworthy nonfiction near the front of the store. No one was lining up to get them, or even browsing. Bookseller Alex Howe told CNN around 3 p.m. that though the store had procured “several dozen” copies, not a single one had yet sold — a figure he said was surprising, considering how many people in media and publishing work in the area.
“We ordered a lot and so far, people have not been beating down the door,” Howe said. “I’m not sure where we’re gonna put them because right now, supply is outpacing demand.” (A manager at McNally Jackson noted that Howe was speaking only in a personal capacity, not as a representative of the store.)
Political memoirs have seen mixed success at the bookstore this year. While Kamala Harris’ “107 Days” was displayed on a shelf with other bestsellers, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman’s “Unfettered” had been a “flop,” per store staff.
In fairness, it was a slow day. The release of “American Canto” coincided with a major winter storm in the Northeast, which was forecast to bring heavy snow and sleet at midday, though all Manhattan saw was cold rain. Still, it may have prompted otherwise eager readers to stay home.
Online sales haven’t been particularly frenzied either, though. By Wednesday morning, the hardcover edition of “American Canto” ranked No. 6,709 on Amazon’s bestseller list, and commentators on social mediadeemedearly numbers disappointing. After a brief Tuesday morning appearance at No. 1 in Amazon’s narrowcast “Journalist Biographies” category, it slipped to No. 3 the following day, behind Cameron Crowe’s “The Uncool: A Memoir” and Margaret Atwood’s “Book of Lives.”
As of this writing, there were 33 people total waiting for the four electronic copies in circulation at the Brooklyn Public Library. As with Lizza’s paywalled installments of his side of the story, which circulated widely via pdf and email among journalists reluctant to invest subscription money in the scandal, there appeared to be a gap between how ready people were to read the story and how ready they were to pay to read it.
Despite the apparent lack of shopper interest, the Nuzzi saga was an animating subject for McNally staff, who were discussing her new release among themselves before this reporter approached them. One employee mentioned she had been heavily invested in the drama, dissecting the turn of events with everyone from her friends to her uncle.
Howe said he had also followed Nuzzi’s writing and reporting over the years and likened his fascination with the latest salacious scandal involving RFK Jr. to “a car crash on the highway where I feel curious and also bad for them.” Though he said he probably won’t read “American Canto,” he wished her well.
“If it turns out to be something that didn’t work out, she at least tried something that’s really hard for any author, regardless of whether you’re a reporter or whatever else,” he said, adding, “It can be hard to compete with the likes of Britney Spears and Emily Henry for attention and sales.”"
Trump administration lets Southwest Airlines off the hook with a multimillion dollar waiver for 2022 holiday travel meltdown,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/06/us/southwest-airlines-meltdown-last-fine-waived,"Dec 6, 2025, 9:37 PM ET","The Trump administration has let Southwest Airlines off the hook for paying the remainder of a fine for the airline’s 2022 holiday travel meltdown – a service disruption that left more than 2 million passengers stranded.
An order by the Department of Transportation issued late Friday said Southwest would not have to pay the last $11 million installment of the$140 million fineleveled against the airline by the Biden administration in 2023.
Southwest’s historic, 10-day schedule meltdown, resulted in 17,000 canceled flights over the very end of 2022 and start of 2023. The cancellations made up nearly half of the airline’s flight schedule during the buzzing holiday season.
How Southwest failed the holidays: Four charts explaining the cancellations
While the exact cause of the travel catastrophe is unclear, Southwest’s CEO, Bob Jordan, told employees they were “suffering from a lack of tools” along with “a lot of issues in the operation” at the time.
Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary said, “Their system really has completely melted down,” after speaking with Jordan.
A spokesperson for the airline blamed a winter storm for the thousands of canceled and delayed flights.
Nevertheless, no reason was enough to atone for the ruined holiday plans of the millions of passengers. Southwest paid $600 million in refunds and reimbursements to passengers who were affected by the travel nightmare, the transportation department said at the time.
Piling on customer compensation, the airline faced additional labor costs and lost revenue that continued into February. On an after-tax basis, it reported the service meltdown cost $914 million.
The $140 million fine from the federal government followed almost a year after the holiday meltdown.
The fine was set to create a new $90 million fund to compensate “future Southwest passengers affected by cancellations or significant delays caused by the airline,” and $35 million was to be paid to the US Treasury, according to the transportation department.
The last installment was due by the end of January, before the Trump administration extended the $11 million waiver.
Insiders at Southwest reveal how the airline’s service imploded
The department says it made its decision because Southwest has made worthwhile investments in its operations control center and “the Department is of the view that it is more beneficial for the flying public to give Southwest credit for significantly improving its on-time performance and completion factor.”
In a statement, Southwest Airlines said it is “grateful to Secretary Duffy and the DOT Team for recognizing Southwest’s significant investments in modernizing our operations.”
“During the last two years, Southwest successfully completed an operational turnaround that directly benefits our Customers with industry leading on-time performance and percentage of completed flights without cancellations,” the airline said."
Taiwan bans popular Chinese social media app amid growing number of fraud cases,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/tech/taiwan-ban-china-xiaohongshu-intl-hnk,"Dec 5, 2025, 2:49 AM ET","Taiwan’s government has ordered a one-year block of a popular, Chinese-owned social media app following its failure to cooperate with authorities over fraud-related concerns.
Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote, has surged in popularity among young Taiwanese in recent years, amassing 3 million users in the self-ruled democracy of 23 million. But the Instagram-like platform has also stoked concerns among officials that it could be used in pro-Beijing propaganda or disinformation campaigns, which Taiwan says it has been battling for years.
China’s Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to annex it by force if necessary.
Taiwan’s Ministry of the Interior on Thursday cited Xiaohongshu’s refusal to cooperate with authorities as the basis for the ban, claiming that the platform has been linked to more than 1,700 fraud-related cases that resulted in financial losses of 247.7 million Taiwanese dollars ($7.9 million).
“Due to the inability to obtain necessary data in accordance with the law, law enforcement authorities have encountered significant obstacles in investigations, creating a de facto legal vacuum,” the ministry said in a statement.
CNN has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment. It is unclear when the ban will take effect. Users in Taiwan could still access the app on Friday afternoon.
The ban comes amid growing alarm among governments worldwide over cybersecurity vulnerabilities and disinformation campaigns associated with Chinese apps like Xiaohongshu and TikTok that have gained global popularity.
Chinese regulations require companies to store data domestically and allow the government access to that data. Beijing also actively surveils and censors content it deems unfavorable, a practice experts say can sway public opinion.
US Congress passed a law last year that forced TikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the platform to an American owner or face a ban, which caused the app togo dark for several hoursearlier this year. President Donald Trump later sought to salvage the platform andnegotiated a deal with China, though a final agreement has yet to be inked.
India blockedTikTok and dozens of other Chinese appsover similar concerns in 2020.
Several Western countries, including theUS, theUnited Kingdom, andEuropean Union nations, have banned TikTok on government devices on national security grounds since 2023. The US state of Texas has also added Xiaohongshu to its ban, pertaining to government-issued devices.
As early as 2019, Taiwan banned Xiaohongshu, TikTok, and its sister app in China Douyin from official devices.
Earlier this week, Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairsflagged five appsas posing “significant cybersecurity risks,” including Xiaohongshu, TikTok, X-like Weibo, and China’s everything app WeChat. These apps could collect sensitive data and share with third parties without consent, it said. A cybersecurity assessment conducted by the National Security Bureau also found that Xiaohongshu failed all of its evaluations.
However, the ban has already sparked some backlash from users and opposition parties, who described it as an infringement on freedom of speech.
“We once mocked people in China for needing VPNs to access information,” Lai Shyh-bao, a legislator of the main opposition party Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China, said on Facebook. “Internet freedom in Taiwan is heading toward a day when people will need VPNs.”
Major international platforms such as Facebook, Google, LINE, and TikTok have all appointed legal representatives in Taiwan, complied with local regulations, and fulfilled their legal obligations, the Ministry of the Interior said.
Taiwan authorities have requested that Shanghai-based Xiaohongshu submit concrete remedial plans, but the company has yet to respond, the ministry added.
“This is not a problem unique to Taiwan. It exists around the world, and even within China itself this platform has repeatedly violated regulations…From our perspective, it is a malicious platform — one that is beyond legal oversight and operates with unclear intentions,” said Ma Shih-yuan, deputy minister of the interior, at a Thursday presser."
Fact check: Trump delivers long list of false claims at Cabinet meeting,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/politics/fact-check-trump-cabinet-meeting,"Dec 2, 2025, 2:14 PM ET","Asusual, President Donald Trump made numerous false claims in his televised Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. And, as usual, most of them had previously been debunked.
Trump repeated familiar false claims about consumer prices, investment in the US, foreign affairs, public safety, the 2020 election, and his signature domestic policy legislation, among other topics.
Here is a fact check of 13 of his inaccurate assertions, plus one more that needs context.
Grocery prices:Trump repeated his false claim that “grocery prices are down.”They’re up. The most recent availableConsumer Price Index figures, for September, show average grocery prices were up about 2.7% from September 2024; about 1.4% from January 2025, the month Trump returned to office; and about 0.3% from August to September.
Prescription drug prices:Trump repeated his false claim that an executive order he issued on prescription drug prices will “slash drug prices by 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%,” adding, “Nobody’s ever heard of it before”; later in the meeting, he used a “900%” figure. Nobody has heard of such reductions because they are mathematically impossible; if the president magically got the companies to reduce the prices of all of their drugs to $0, that would be a 100% cut. You can read a longer fact checkhere.
Inflation under Trump:Trump falsely claimed, “Since last January, we’ve stopped inflation in its tracks.” That’s a vague phrase, but it’s not true by any reasonable definition of “stopped in its tracks.” Inflation hasn’t been stopped at all; the year-over-yearinflation ratein September,3.0%, was the same asthe rate in January– in fact, if you go to multiple decimal places, the September rate was a tiny bit higher – and September was the fifth consecutive month the year-over-year rate had increased. (In fairness, Trump did add Tuesday: “And there’s still more to do, there’s always more to do, but we have it down to a very good level.”)
Inflation under President Joe Biden:Trump repeated his false claim that “I inherited the worst inflation in history.” He added, “They say it’s the worst inflation that we’ve had in 48 years, I say ever.” Again, Trump inherited a 3.0% inflation rate, same as the most recent rate. He could have fairly said the year-over-year US inflationrate hit a 40-year high under Biden in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to theall-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920. Trump was also wrong if he was claiming there was record cumulative inflation over the course of Biden’s presidency; it was much higher during the Jimmy Carter administration.
Investment in the US:After referring to “new investments in the United States,” Trump repeated his false claim that “we’ve secured commitments of over $18 trillion.” This figure is fiction. At the time he spoke on Tuesday, the White House’sown websitesaid the figure was “$9.6 trillion,” and even that is a major exaggeration; a detailed CNN review in October found the White House was counting trillions of dollars in vague investment pledges, pledges that were about “bilateral trade” or “economic exchange” rather than investment in the US, or vague statements that didn’t even rise to the level of pledges.

Gas prices:Talking about gas prices, Trump claimed, “We’re now at about $2.50 a gallon.” This claim isn’t false, since AAAfoundseven states had Tuesday average gas prices below $2.60 per gallon (and Oklahoma was under $2.50, at about $2.40 per gallon), but it’s worth noting that the national average remains well above $2.50 per gallon – almost exactly $3.00 per gallon,according to AAA.
US aid to Ukraine:Trump repeated his false claim that “Biden gave away $350 billion” in aid to Ukraine, adding, “That’s a massive amount of money.” Trump’s figure isn’t close to accurate. The US government inspector general overseeing the federal Ukraine responsesaysthe US had disbursed about $94 billion as of the end of June 2025 (and had appropriated about $93 billion more), including money that was spent in the US and in broader Europe rather than Ukraine itself. And a German think tank that has closelytrackedwartime aid to Ukraine says the US allocated about $133 billion to Ukraine (and had committed about $5 billion more) through August, at current exchange rates.
Trump and wars:Trump repeated his false claim that “we ended eight wars” and “I’ve settled eight wars.” While Trump has played a role in resolving some conflicts (at least temporarily), the “eight” figure is aclear exaggeration.
Trump hasexplainedthat his list of supposed wars settled includes a war between Egypt and Ethiopia, but that wasn’t actually a war; it is a long-running diplomatic dispute about amajor Ethiopian dam projecton a tributary of the Nile River, a dispute that is unresolved. Trump’s list includesanother supposed war that didn’t actually occurduring his presidency, between Serbia and Kosovo. (He has sometimesclaimedto have prevented the eruption of a new war between those two entities, providing few details about what he meant, but that is different than settling an actual war.) And his list includes a supposed success in ending a war involving the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, but that warhas continueddespite a peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration this year – which was never signed by the leading rebel coalition doing the fighting.
One can debate the importance of Trump’s role in having ended the other conflicts on his list, or fairly question whether some of them have truly ended. For example, killingcontinuedin Gaza in November after the October ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Regardless, Trump’s “eight” figure is too big.
Strikes on alleged drug boats:Defending his military strikes on alleged drug boats in international waters, Trump repeated his false claim that “every boat that you see get blown up, we save 25,000 – on average – lives; 25,000 lives.”
Aside from the fact that the Trump administration has not presented public proof for his repeated claims that the boats carried deadly fentanyl – the Caribbean, where most of the strikes have occurred, isnot knownto be a significant fentanyl-smuggling route – his “25,000” number does not make sense. Thetotalnumber of US overdose deaths from all drugs in 2024 was about 82,000, according to provisionalfederal data.
The president’s figure is “absurd,” Carl Latkin, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University school of public health with a joint appointment at its medical school, said in October. You can read a longer fact checkhere.
China and gasoline:Talking about energy and the environment, Trump claimed, “We have so much gasoline. You know, China doesn’t have gasoline; we do.” It’s not true that China simply “doesn’t have gasoline.” China produced more than four million barrels per day of crude oil in 2024,according to the US Energy Information Administration(EIA). Trump could have accurately said that China’s production was much less than US production (more than 13 million barrels per dayin 2024, per the EIA) or that China didn’t produce nearly enough to meet domestic demand (Chinese refinersprocessed more than 14 million barrels per dayin 2024) – but “China doesn’t have gasoline” went too far.
Biden and electric cars:Trump falsely claimed, “By 2030, everybody had to own an electric car under the Biden stupidity.” While Biden did have policies aiming to push automakers to manufacture electric cars rather than gas-powered cars, he hadno policythat would have required Americans to own an electric car (or get rid of their gas-powered cars). Rather, theemissions rulesfor automakers that were unveiled by the Biden administration in 2024 aimed to have electric vehicles make up 35% to 56% of new passenger vehicles sold in 2032.
The 2020 election:Trump repeated his lies that the 2020 election was “a fake election” and “a rigged election.” Trump legitimately lost a free and fair election to Biden.
Crime in Washington, DC:Trump falsely claimed that Washington, DC, now has “no murders,” though he also discussedlast week’s deadly attackon National Guard troops. Even before that attack, there continued to be homicides in Washington after Trump deployed the Guard there in August;herearesomeexamplesfrom November alone. Trump made a similar remark last week, falselyclaimingthe capital hadn’t had a single murder “in six months.”
Trump’s bill and Social Security:Trump repeated his false claim that the big domestic policy bill he signed earlier this year includes “no tax on Social Security.” The legislation did create an additional, temporary $6,000-per-year tax deduction for individuals age 65 and older (with a smaller deduction for individuals earning $75,000 per year or more), but the White House itself has implicitlyacknowledgedthat millions of Social Security recipients age 65 and older will continue to pay taxes on their benefits – and that new deduction, which expires in 2028, doesn’t even apply to the Social Securityrecipients who are younger than 65."
CDC’s annual abortion report delayed amid agency turmoil,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/health/abortion-trends-cdc-delay-wecount-report,"Dec 9, 2025, 7:00 AM ET","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been tracking abortion trends for decades, but this year’s report — including some of the earliest federal data reflecting the effect of significant changes to abortion access nationwide – has been pushed back until spring amid turmoil at the federal agency.
Each year, states and jurisdictions voluntarily report data that they’ve collected to the CDC for a national analysis, a process that has been happening in some form since 1969. The CDC compiles that information into a report that’s typically published in late November.
The US Department of Health and Human Services blames former CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Debra Houry for the delay of this year’s abortion surveillance report, saying in a statement that Houry “directed staff to return state-submitted abortion data rather than analyze it.”
Houry denies this claim, instead saying that major layoffs at HHS this year left the CDC without the staff it needed to do the work.
Afterthousands of people were laid off​from HHS in April, Houry says, she helped lead a transition management team that developed agency-wide approaches to manage the effects of the layoffs, including coordinated communication. At that time, she says, the agency had also implemented a policy in which all external communication — including to partners at state and local health departments — had to be approved by a communications office led by politically appointed staff during the initial weeks after the layoffs.
“The policy that was proposed by the agency to us — that we signed off on — was that there’s no funding, no staff, and not statutorily required [so] the program can’t do the work,” she told CNN. “The politicals were all aware, back in April, that this was one of the programs that couldn’t continue, along with many others.”
An HHS official told CNN that Houry did not follow this process of checking with political appointees or other agency leadership before shutting down the abortion surveillance data project, but HHS didn’t respond to a request for details about how or when it heard about the supposed action by Houry.
Houry was one of several high-level veteran agency officials whoresignedin protest in August after CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez was fired just weeks after she had been sworn in to the position. The exiting leaders described censorship, communication failures and the weaponization of public health by HHS in resignation letters, social media posts and statements from attorneys.
The delayed CDC abortion surveillance report is expected to include data through 2023, the first full year after the US Supreme Court Dobbs decision that revoked the federal right to an abortion.
Researchers outside the federal government have also started tracking abortion trends in the US in the past few years, and a new#WeCount reportsponsored by the Society of Family Planning shows that the number of abortions provided in the US has continued to increase post-Dobbs.
There were an average of nearly 99,000 abortions each month in the first half of 2025, up about 4% from the monthly average last year, according to the report, which was published Tuesday.
Most abortions in the US still happen in person, but the latest #WeCount data shows that medication abortions provided through telehealth account for all of the increase so far this year.
In the first half of 2025, 27% of all abortions within the US health care system were provided via telehealth, up from less than 10% in the first half of 2023.
More than half of the telehealth abortions in the US are now provided under shield laws, which offer some legal protections for providers who practice in some states where abortion remains legal to prescribe medication abortion drugs via telehealth to people living in states with bans or restrictions. In June, nearly 15,000 abortions were provided under shield laws in the US, #WeCount data shows.
“Abortion bans don’t stop people from needing and pursuing essential abortion care,” Dr. Alison Norris, co-chair of the #WeCount research project and professor at The Ohio State University’s College of Public Health, said in a statement. “Telehealth is helping people in states with bans to access abortion care – and yet it isn’t the answer for everyone. Abortion bans are causing harm, and all too often, your access to healthcare depends on where you live and how much money you have.”
Although abortion surveillance data from the CDC is a bit older than data reported by #WeCount and other research organizations like theGuttmacher Institute, experts say it still adds critical pieces to the overall picture.
“I thought the CDC data set was helpful because it came from health departments, it was anonymized, and it used the same questions year after year, so it’s able to track trends over a long period of time,” Houry said.
But layoffs left the department without the subject-matter experts who understand the nuances of the project.
“It’s really hard to replace people,” she said. “This is the thing that’s happening for any programs that don’t have funding or staff, because I don’t know how you do work if you don’t have funding or staff.”"
Michael and Susan Dell donate $6.25 billion to fund ‘Trump Accounts’ for millions of American kids,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/business/michael-susan-dell-donation-trump-accounts,"Dec 2, 2025, 9:04 AM ET","Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday announced that they are donating $6.25 billion to fund investment accounts for at least 25 million American children.
The enormous pledge will go toward helping fund “Trump Accounts,” a new initiative that offersinvestment accountsfor children. The “Trump Accounts” were established as part of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and are set to launch in 2026.
The Treasury Department is set to deposit $1,000 into the account of every eligible US citizen child born from January 2025 through December 31, 2028.
The Dells’ charitable gift will go toward children ages 10 and under who were born before the cut-off for the Treasury’s funding. The Dells’ donation will fund $250 deposits for investment accounts for at least 25 million children, resulting in a total gift of $6.25 billion.
It’s one of the largest private investments in American children in history, according to Invest America, a nonprofit organization helping spearhead the initiative to develop these accounts.
“We feel super excited to be able to make a difference in millions of children’s futures and create opportunity, hope and prosperity for them,” Michael Dell, CEO at Dell Technologies, told CNN in a phone interview.
“If you think about the power of compounding and what these accounts are likely to become over 10, 20, 30 years, that’s super significant,” Dell said.
How the $1,000-per-baby ‘Trump accounts’ would work and who would benefit most
Dell, who founded his tech company in 1984, is the world’s 11th richest individual, with a net worth of $148 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
The Dells had donated $2.9 billion to charitable causes to date, according to the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, making this $6.25 billion pledge more than double the entirety of their previous giving.
“When we heard about this idea, we were thrilled, because this allows us to reach such a huge number of children with this program,” Susan Dell told CNN in a phone interview. “Investing in children and their future is really investing in all of our futures. Children are the future. So we couldn’t be more excited about this program.”
At a White House event with the Dells on Tuesday afternoon, Trump said the accounts will allow “family members, employers, corporations [and] generous donors to contribute money that will be invested and grow over the course of a child’s life to be used for their benefit after they turn 18.”
“Trump Accounts” are tax-deferred investment accounts intended to help American children grow their savings.
Parents and guardians will be able to file a new form with the IRS (Form 4547) to establish a “Trump Account” for their child. Starting in May 2026, the Treasury Department will follow up with those who filed to complete the process of opening an account.
Sign-ups for accounts will also be availableonlinestarting in mid-2026. The site is expected to be updated with additional information on how to set up accounts, according to a new “Trump Accounts”profileon X.
Private contributions will first be able to be made on July 4, 2026.  The accounts will allow for private contributions of up to $5,000 a year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 of that amount.
The accounts will be invested in mutual funds or index funds tracking the S&P 500 or other benchmark indexes.
Any child aged 18 or under with a Social Security number will be eligible to have an account. The Treasury Department will only fund $1,000 for children born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028.
The Dells’ gift will fund $250 for children ages 10 and under who were born before January 2025, expanding the number of children receiving funding to start an account. If there are additional funds remaining after initial sign-ups, children older than 10 may be eligible. The Dells’ funds will be distributed to individual accounts by the Treasury Department.
The investment account will be locked for withdrawals until the child turns 18.
At that point, the account will be treated as a traditional individual retirement account.
Funds can be used toward expenses including education, down payments on a first home, or money to start a business, subject to general withdrawal rules associated with IRAs.
While parents may welcome the prospect of “free money,” as a savings vehicle, the “Trump Accounts” add yet more complexity to an already complex web of savings accounts options for families — each with their own eligibility and withdrawal rules, contribution limits and tax treatment.
“For parents looking to set up an account for their children’s education, a 529 account offers more flexibility and tax benefits,” the Tax Foundation said in a statement. “If the federal government really wanted to make saving more accessible for taxpayers, it would replace the complicated mess of savings accounts currently available with universal savings accounts.”
The backstory begins with Brad Gerstner, CEO of Altimeter Capital, and a friend of the Dells.
In 2021, Gerstner founded Invest America, the nonprofit helping advocate for these savings accounts.
Michael Dell said after learning about the idea from Gerstner, he was very excited about the prospect of it and had talked to the Biden administration, but nothing came to fruition until this year when he spoke to Trump.
“I had an opportunity to explain it to the president earlier this year,” Dell told CNN.
Dell appeared at the White House in June alongside other business executives when Trumppromoted the ideaof the “Trump Accounts.”
“We believe that the smartest investment we can make is the one that we make in children,” Dell told CNN. “We’ve also talked with a number of other philanthropists, and we feel confident there’ll be other significant gifts that get announced.”
Dell said the $250 deposits will be focused on children in zip codes where the median income is less than $150,000. The gift is expected to reach children across 75% of US zip codes, according to Invest America.
“What we really hope is that children will see that there’s a future worth saving for, and if every child sees that there is a future worth saving for, then we’ll have been a part of helping build that hope and opportunity and prosperity for generations to come,” Susan Dell told CNN."
Parkinson’s disease is on the rise. 5 expert tips to reduce your risk of developing it,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/health/parkinson-risk-reduction-wellness,"Dec 9, 2025, 11:01 AM ET","EDITOR’S NOTE:The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodeshere.
The “Shaking Palsy.”
Those are the words Dr. James Parkinson used inan essaymore than 200 years ago to group together symptoms and describe a mysterious infirmity afflicting six individuals in London. The British physician was thefirst to identifyand document the condition now known as Parkinson’s disease, a progressive movement disorder. Its hallmark is damage to the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain that can lead to muscle stiffness, slowness, balance issues and a host of other problems.
Dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitterinvolved in our brain’s reward system. The chemical plays a central role in motivation, as well asexecutive function(which includes attention, decision-making, multitasking and planning), movement and emotional regulation.
By 2021, public health researchers  reported there werealmost 12 million casesworldwide. And the number of people living with Parkinson’s is projected totop 25 millionby 2050. The disease not onlysubstantially burdensthe individual, but also their family, their community and society as a whole.
“We’re now growing as a neurodegenerative disease faster than Alzheimer’s disease — that should grab everybody’s attention,” neurologist Dr. Michael Okun told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
Parkinson’s disease is so much more than just a shaking palsy, as scientists have come to learn since 1817, but there is still quite a ways to go in identifying its root causes, understanding more fully the progression of the disease, and even developing a foolproof diagnostic test.
Parkinson’s disease prevention may ‘begin at the dinner table’
“It becomes obvious, just absolutely obvious, when you see the folks with disease that this isn’t just a disease of dopamine; it isn’t just a disease of the brain. We see it in the gut. We see it in the skin. We see it in multiple organs,” said Okun, who cofounded and codirects the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and is the medical director and medical adviser for the Parkinson’s Foundation. “So, it is super important that we ask the why: Why does it start? Why does it progress? Why does it spread?”
Geneticsplays a key role in between 10% and 15% of cases. For many others, Okun said, the underlying cause of the disease might be more mundane and insidious:environmental toxins— via the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat andthe chemicalswith which we regularly come in contact.
“We have such an opportunity now to understand, hey, we don’t have to live in a world where we think it’s inevitable to get Parkinson’s,” Okun said. His latest book on the disease, “The Parkinson’s Plan: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment,” cowritten with Dr. Ray Dorsey, in part explores the associations between the disease and a host of chemicals thatquietly assailour bodies.
﻿You can listen to the full episodehere.
What can you do to reduce your chances of getting Parkinson’s? Okun has a list of 25 tips in his book, and these are his five favorites.
Invest in acarbon water filterfor your kitchen sink, Okun said via email.
“A simple carbon filter can reduce theinvisible toxicantsthatsneak into drinking waterand may stress vulnerable brain systems,” he said. “Clean water lowers the everyday chemical load your gut and brain must handle.”
These filters can reduce exposure to pesticides and chemicals liketrichlorethylene, or TCE, a common chemical used to dry-clean clothes, decaffeinate coffee and degrease metal, as well as other impurities. (In December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency announced an almostcomplete ban of TCE, but lawsuits have so farstayed therule’s effective start date under certain circumstances.)
Use air purifiersboth at home and work.
“Removingfine particulate matterfrom indoor air protects the nose-to-brain pathway that may seed Parkinson’s,” Okun said. “Cleaner air means fewer triggers entering through the brain’s front door.”
Make sure to use an air purifier with a carbon filter designed to remove volatile organic chemicals, or VOCs, such as TCE.Volatile organic compounds are gasesthat can be emitted from solid or liquid products, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These chemicals can cause problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation and damage to the liver, kidney and central nervous system, the federal agency said.
Thousands of cleaning supplies may contain substances linked to health problems
Take the time to wash your fruits and vegetables, even if they are organic.
“Rinsing and scrubbing your produce … helps remove pesticide residues that can quietly injure mitochondria over time,” Okun noted. “This simple daily habit lowers the exposure load your brain and nervous system must manage.”
And just as you would when washing your hands, you should rinse them for more than 20 seconds, Okun added.
Exercise every day. Regular movement is thought to prevent or delay the onset of Parkinson’s disease — and it is also crucial for people who already live with the disorder.
“Exercise every day, using four 20-minute walks (~7000 steps), or an equivalent routine that keeps you moving throughout the day,” Okun said via email. “Movement wakes up natural dopamine circuits, improves mobility, and may possibly slow symptom progression.”
For those who feel unsteady on their feet, Okun noted that a recumbent stationary bike is a safe and effective alternative.

Prioritize  consistent, high-quality sleep to give your brain a chance to recover every night.
“Deep sleep activates thebrain’s built-in cleaning system, flushing toxins and helping symptoms improve the following day,” Okun said. “Protecting sleep is protecting brain health, especially when living with or aiming to prevent Parkinson’s.”
Then, when you get up in the morning, enjoy a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea. Research has consistently associated caffeine consumption with a lower risk of Parkinson’s Disease ; it is believed to protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from damage caused by environmental toxins.

"Michael Jordan testifies in NASCAR antitrust trial, says he had no choice but to sue",https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/sport/motorsports-nascar-michael-jordan-testifies-antitrust-trial,"Dec 5, 2025, 4:46 PM ET","Retired NBA great Michael Jordan took the stand at the landmark NASCARantitrust caseand testified Friday that he has been a fan of thestock car seriessince he was a child but felt he had little choice but to sue to force changes in a business model he sees shortchanging teams and drivers risking their lives to keep the sport going.
Jordan testified before a packed courtroom for an hour. His celebrity drew quips from the judge and even a defense attorney as he outlined why the team he co-owns, 23XI, had joined Front Row Motorsports in going to court against the top auto racing series in the United States.
“Someone had to step forward and challenge the entity,” the soft-spoken Jordan told the jury. “I sat in those meetings with longtime owners who were brow-beaten for so many years trying to make change. I was a new person, I wasn’t afraid. I felt I could challenge NASCAR as a whole. I felt as far as the sport, it needed to be looked at from a different view.”
Jordan’s highly anticipated appearance followed dramatic testimony from Heather Gibbs, the daughter-in-law of race team owner Joe Gibbs, about the chaotic six-hour period in which teams had to sign an extension or forfeit the charters that guarantee revenue week to week throughout NASCAR’s 38-race season.
“The document was something in business you would never sign,” said Heather Gibbs, who is also a licensed real estate agent. “It was like a gun to your head: if you don’t sign, you have nothing.”
Charters are the equivalent of the franchise model used in other sports and in NASCAR it guarantees every chartered car a spot in every race, plus a defined payout from the series. The system was created in 2016, and during the two-plus years of bitter negotiations on an extension, teams begged for the renewable charters to be made permanent for revenue stability.
When NASCAR refused to make them permanent and gave the teams six hours in September 2024 to sign the 112-page extension, 23XI and Front Row Motorsports were the only two organizations out of 15 to refuse. They instead filed the antitrust suit and the trial opened Monday to hear their allegations that NASCAR is a monopolistic bully. 23XI is co-owned by Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row is owned by fast food franchiser Bob Jenkins.
Jordan testified that 23XI bought a third charter late in 2024 for $28 million even with all the uncertainty.
“I’m pretty sure they know I love to win,” the six-time NBA champion said. “Denny convinced me getting a third driver improved our chances to win, so I dove in.”
Like other witnesses this week, Jordan described a NASCAR that refused to discuss options or potential changes to the charter system, which he supports. He was asked why 23XI didn’t sign the extensions last fall.
“One, I didn’t think it was economically viable. Two, it said you could not sue NASCAR, that was an antitrust violation, I felt. Three, they gave us an ultimatum I didn’t think was fair to 23XI,” Jordan said, adding: “I wanted a partnership and permanent charters wasn’t even a consideration. The pillars that the teams wanted, no one on the NASCAR side even negotiated or compromised. They were not even open-minded to welcome those conversations, so this is where we ended up.”
Jordan referred to the NBA business model, which shares approximately half its revenue with players, far more than NASCAR.
“The revenue split was far less than any business I’ve ever been a part of. We didn’t think we’d ever get to what basketball was getting but we wanted to move in that direction,” he said. “The thing I see in NASCAR that I think is absent is a shared responsibility of growth as well as loss.”
Jordan said he owns 60% of 23XI and has invested $35 million to $40 million in the team. Jenkins testified earlier this week that he has never turned a profit since launching his NASCAR team in the early 2000s and estimates he’s lost $100 million even while winning the Daytona 500 in 2021.
Heather Gibbs earlier told the jury how she became co-owner of Joe Gibbs Racing the day after her husband, Coy, unexpectedly died in his sleep the same night their son, Ty, won NASCAR’s second-tier Xfinity Series championship in 2022. Coy Gibbs had moved into a leadership role with JGR following the death of his older brother, J.D., in 2019.
Because Gibbs had lost both his sons and had built the team as a legacy for his family, his daughter-in-law took an active role in the organization and personally participated in negotiations for the charter extensions. When NASCAR made its final offer at 6 p.m. on a Friday night with just hours to sign, the agreement did not include permanent charters. Gibbs testified the organization was devastated.
“Everything was going so fast, the legacy of Coy, the legacy of J.D., everyone at JGR was very upset,” she told the jury. She said her father-in-law called NASCAR chairman Jim France pleading for a resolution.
“Joe said, ‘Jim, you can’t do this,’” she said. “And Jim was done with the conversation.”
Heather Gibbs said she had to leave to take her son to a baseball game in Chapel Hill and left worried about her father-in-law, who was 84 at the time.
“I left him sitting in the dark, listening to his blood sugar monitors going off,” she testified. “We decided we had to sign. We can’t lose everything. I did not think it was a fair deal to the teams.”
Katherine Legge never set out to be a role model, but now she says she has a point to prove in NASCAR
Joe Gibbs is both a Hall of Fame NASCAR owner and NFL Hall of Fame coach. He led the Washington football team to three Super Bowl titles and JGR has won five Cup Series championships. JGR has 450 employees, charters for four Cup cars and relies solely on outside sponsorship and investors to keep the team afloat. The team will mark its 35th season next year and Gibbs told the jury that JGR needs permanent charters to protect its investment in NASCAR.
“It’s the most important point, a permanent place in their history books,” she testified. “It is absolutely vital to the teams for us to know we have security, it can’t be taken away, to know what we’ve invested in is ours.”"

Sur Finanzas said ina statementlast week that all the services it provides are carried out in compliance with current regulations and referred to the accusations as “unfounded.”
Video taken by CNN and affiliate TN on Tuesday shows uniformed federal police moving in and out of the Argentine Football Associationbuilding in Buenos Aires.
CNN contacted the AFA for comment and is still awaiting a response.
A source familiar with the case told CNN that the investigation began following suspicions of irregularities in Sur Finanzas’ contract with Club Atlético Banfield, one of the most historic teams in Argentina’s top soccer division.
Banfield said in astatementthat the club will cooperate with the investigation.
The same source said that after authorities initially raided Banfield and Sur Finanzas, documents were found that allegedly linked the company to other clubs in different divisions. As a result, more than 30 raids were approved on Tuesday to verify whether there are irregularities in other contracts.

In a complaint filed Friday in the US Court of International Trade in Manhattan, Costco (COST) said Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs left it uncertain whether businesses can recoup sums they should not have paid.
Based in Issaquah, Washington, Costco joined dozens of companies suing to safeguard potential refunds. It is also among the largest, with $275.2 billion of revenue in its fiscal year ending August 31.
The nation’s largest warehouse club operator said US Customs and Border Protection denied its request for more time to make final calculations of tariffs owed, threatening its right to complete refunds even if the Supreme Court rules against Trump.
Customs and Border Protection had no immediate comment. Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other companies that have sued to preserve refunds include Bumble Bee Foods, Ray-Ban eyeglass maker EssilorLuxottica, Kawasaki Motors, Revlon and Yokohama Tire, court records show.
During oral arguments on November 5, Supreme Court justices from both sides of the political spectrum asked skeptical questions about whether Trump legally used the 1977 emergency powers law to impose tariffs.
The justices took the case on an accelerated basis, but have not said when they will rule.
Costco has taken multiple steps to address tariffs, including by reducing the number of suppliers, and relying more on local sourcing and its in-house Kirkland brand."
Trump’s threats bring war with Venezuela closer as contradictions and legal fears mount,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/01/politics/trump-venezuela-threats-pressure,"Dec 1, 2025, 12:00 AM ET","Intensifying US threats against Venezuela are raising expectations of imminent military action as President Donald Trumpheaps pressureon the Caracas regime and flexes power in the Western Hemisphere.
Every public sign and warning by the president raises the risk that the US is on an inexorable path toward a military confrontation that would represent a big political gamble given the public’s antipathy toward new foreign wars.
Trump plans to hold a meeting at the White House Monday evening about next steps on Venezuela, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected to attend, as well as White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.
Controversy is also mounting because of new concerns about the legality of any potential action against Venezuela and warnings that the administration’slethal strikesagainst alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean have infringed the laws of war. Congressional committees are pledging vigorous, bipartisan oversight of the attacks — a rare occurrence in Trump’s second term.
And in an extraordinary move over the Thanksgiving holiday, Trump appeared to undercut the rationale that he’s fighting regional cartels with theoffer of a pardonto a former Honduran president jailed last year in the US for funneling cocaine into the country.
Trump fueled expectations of looming warfare in Venezuela by warning on Thanksgiving Day that the US will “very soon” start taking action to stop alleged drug-trafficking networks on land. On Saturday,he declaredthe impoverished, oil-rich country’s airspace should be considered closed. An armada of US ships is stationed in the Caribbean Sea off Venezuela, led by the world’s mightiest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford. Administration officials have meanwhile spent weeks crafting legal arguments for action against regional drug traffickers that critics warn fall short of legal and constitutional stipulations.
Yet, with the US potentially on the edge of a new war, the administration is yet to provide the public with evidence-based and legally detailed rationales for sending American sons and daughters into action.
This raises the possibility that the buildup and threats are part of a psychological pressure campaign to force President Nicolás Maduro to step down or to encourage officials or generals to topple him. Or a possible military showdown with Venezuela could simply be a new sign this administration sees few political, moral, legal or constitutional curbs on acting exactly how Trump wants.
And even if this is all a bluff to trigger regime change peacefully, officials must soon consider what to do if it fails. Trump’s authority will suffer a huge blow if he draws down US forces with Maduro still in office.
Trumpon Sunday confirmedfor the first time that he’d spoken over the phone to Maduro recently but did not say when or what he discussed. “I don’t want to comment on it; the answer is yes,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “I wouldn’t say it went well or badly. It was a phone call.”
A new US war or concentrated military action abroad would contradict one of the president’s core foreign policy principles — the avoidance of new overseas conflicts. And multiple polls show Americans are opposed to a strike on Venezuela. ACBS News surveylast month found 76% didn’t believe that Trump had explained his position there and only 13% saw the country as a major threat to US security.
In the past, some US administrations have made strenuous efforts ahead of military engagement to prepare the public for action and to rally support behind the president — as was the case before the invasion of Iraq in 2003. But apart from vague comments about fighting drug cartels — some of which may overstate Venezuela’s place in the narcotics trade — senior officials have offered few explanations to the public.
Still, millions of Venezuelans would not miss Maduro if he’s toppled after years of repression that has impoverished a country with huge economic potential and led to the flight of millions of refugees, including to the US. There are some scenarios in which Maduro’s departure might benefit US foreign policy and the region — although administration officials have offered little clarity on whether they’ve planned for the day after any military action. The failure to do so in Iraq and Afghanistan led to foreign policy disasters.Some analysts fearregime change could trigger chaos and bloodshed in a nation as fractured as Venezuela, possibly sending even more refugees into neighboring countries and the US.
Sen. Markwayne Mullin, however, defended Trump’s approach. He said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday the president gave Maduro an invitation to leave and that he’s protecting the US from drug traffickers. “He’s made it very clear we’re not going to put troops into Venezuela,” the Oklahoma Republican told Dana Bash, though Trump hasn’t publicly ruled out that possibility.
Controversy over the administration’s intentions in the region has been fueled further by what people familiar with the incidentdescribed to CNN’s Natasha Bertrandas a follow-up US military attack on a suspected drug vessel on September 2 after an initial attack did not kill everyone aboard. Experts andsome lawmakershave expressed concern that the so-called double-tap strike would violate the laws of armed conflict, which prohibit the execution of an enemy combatant who is taken out of the fight due to injury or surrender.
Details of the strikes were first reported byThe InterceptandThe Washington Post. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists all strikes on alleged drugs boats are lawful under US and international law, partly because traffickers have been designated terrorists by the US government. But Trump’s critics argue the president is waging war without acquiring the authorization of Congress as is required by the Constitution and is infringing the victims’ rights to due process.
Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and fighter jet pilot, said on “State of the Union” that from what he knew about the attack, he would not have carried out the order to conduct a second strike. “If what has been reported is accurate, I have got serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over. We are not Russia. We’re not Iraq,” Kelly said. “They have tied themselves in knots trying to explain to us on the Armed Services Committee how this is legal, not sharing all of the information either, which is really troubling. But going after survivors in the water, that is clearly not lawful.”
Kelly has beenwarned by the Pentagonthat he could be called back into uniform for court-martial over a video he filmed with other Democratic lawmakers reminding military personnel they were not obligated to carry out illegal orders. The lawmakers have said Trump jeopardized their safety after he accused them of “seditious behavior, punishable by death.” He has since denied he was “threatening death” against the group.
The House and Senate armed services committees have pledged to carry out rigorous oversight of the administration’s operations in the Caribbean.
Disquiet about the Trump administration’s motives in Latin America is also being fed by an extraordinary announcement by the president that heplans to pardonformer Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, only a year into a45-year federal prison sentencefor drug trafficking. Hernández was found guilty of conspiring with cartels as they moved 400 tons of cocaine through Honduras to the US and of protecting and enriching drug traffickers in his inner circle.
The president’s pardoning of a leader who operated his country as a narco-state would severely undercut his rationale for using military force against Maduro — whom he accuses of the same offense.
“He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in US courts. And less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narco-trafficking,” Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “If he doesn’t care about narco-trafficking … then what is this Venezuela thing really about?”
The president insisted to reporters Sunday that the conviction was a “Biden setup” and implied that no one who had served as a president should face justice for transgressions in office. “You take any country you want — if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn’t mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life,” he said.
Mullin said on “State of the Union” there was “probably a good-faith” gesture in the president’s pardon offer, and that he trusted his “natural” approach to foreign affairs.
The comparison of the due process previously offered by the United States to Hernández, who was convicted by a jury, to the fate of drug traffickers blown out of the Caribbean Sea, without officials apparently knowing their identities, is striking.
The timing of Trump’s pardon move suggests an alternative explanation, as it came just before Honduransvoted in a presidential electionon Sunday. On Friday, Trump endorsed the populist outsider candidacy of Nasry “Tito” Asfura, who comes from the same conservative National Party as Hernández. His double intervention looks like an attempt to influence the elections, since he threatened in a Truth Social post that the US would not work with any other president but Asfura.
This is far from the first time that Trump has tried to use his power and clout to support MAGA-like leaders in the Western Hemisphere. He slapped a 50% tariff on Brazil afterit prosecutedhis friend and former President Jair Bolsonaro for trying to overthrow an election. He offered a $40 billion bailout to Argentina,conditional on voterssupporting the party of another ally, President Javier Milei, in the midterm elections. Trump has alsoallied himselfwith President Nayib Bukele, the leader of El Salvador, who accepted into a notorious prison deportees from the Trump administration’s purge, and who bills himself as “the world’s coolest dictator.” Hehas feuded withColombia’s leftist leader, President Gustavo Petro.
There are legitimate foreign policy reasons why the United States might seek closer relations with Latin American leaders, especially as it aims to curtail influence-building efforts in the region by Russia and China. The question now preoccupying Latin America is whether Trump is willing to use the sword, not just executive power and taxpayer cash, to get the regime he wants in Venezuela.

Former high-ranking DEA agent accused of conspiring to traffic drugs and launder millions of dollars for a Mexican cartel,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/politics/former-dea-accused-conspiring-traffic-drugs,"Dec 5, 2025, 3:03 PM ET","A former high-level Drug Enforcement Agency agent was indicted on and federal charges of conspiring to traffic drugs and launder millions of dollars for a Mexican cartel.
Paul Campo, who was a DEA agent for nearly 25 years, and his associate Robert Sensi, are accused in a new indictment unsealed Friday of converting cash into cryptocurrency to buy 220 kilograms of cocaine, worth $5 million, and launder $750,000 in proceeds from drug sales for the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, or CJNG. The State Department designated CJNG as a foreign terrorist organization earlier this year.
Campo pleaded not guilty to the charges Friday and was detained.
Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York allege the men agreed to launder at least $12 million for the cartel.
CNN has attempted to reach Campo, who doesn’t have a attorney identified in court records, for comment.
Authorities allege he and Sensi met with a confidential source working at the direction of US law enforcement posing as a member of the cartel. During a meeting in March at a restaurant in New York, according to the indictment, the men discussed how to move money from the US to Mexico, including by investing in real estate and smuggling cash in bulk.
Campo allegedly told the government source that he had other projects where he helped clients “get their money back,” according to the indictment. Campo allegedly flashed his DEA badge to the confidential source in the meeting, telling him he retired from the DEA years ago.
Campo rose to deputy chief of the DEA’s Office of Financial Operations, putting him in charge of the agency’s money laundering operations, according tohis bio at Global Financial Consultants, a company he founded after leaving the agency. He retired from the DEA in 2016. A call and email to the company was not immediately returned Friday. Sensi could not immediately be reached.
Prosecutors allege Campo and others agreed at a meeting in Tampa, Florida, in March to launder up to $12 million in drug trafficking proceeds. They agreed to start small with an initial transaction of $200,000, according to the indictment. After the first drop in Charlotte, North Carolina, the confidential source said to Sensi, “Welcome to the fucking cartel,” according to the indictment.
By October, authorities allege, the confidential source approached the men about participating in a drug deal. He directed Sensi to send over $200,000 in cryptocurrency to the seller for 220 kilograms of cocaine. The government-directed confidential source said he would sell the drugs for $5 million and give Campo and Sensi a 30% cut.
Campo and others sent more than $200,000 in cryptocurrency to a wallet they believed was controlled by the seller, but was really controlled by the Internal Revenue Service. The confidential source confirmed receipt, according to the indictment, and sent an encrypted message to Campo and Sensi saying, “Wow brothers!! Taking possession of the product NOW!!!.”
Campo and Sensi have been charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, conspiracy to distribute narcotics, conspiracy to provide material support to CJNG, and money laundering conspiracy.

The real estate industry is pressuring Zillow and other sites to nix extreme weather risk data buyers have come to rely on,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/climate/zillow-climate-data-extreme-weather-first-street-redfin,"Dec 2, 2025, 12:32 PM ET","Zillow, the nation’s largest real estate listing website, has removed extreme weatherrisk data meant to help buyers figure out if the biggest purchase of their life is particularly susceptible to floods, high winds or wildfires.
Now, other major real estate listing websites are facing pressure to do the same.
That pressure is coming from the California Regional Multiple Listing Service, which operates one of the largest private databases of home listings in the country — essential to Zillow’s business model.
Out of concern that it has impacted home sales, the California group is questioning the accuracy of some climate change-related data compiled by risk modeling company First Street. That company creates current and future risk scores for climate change-fueled disasters like wildfires, coastal and rainstorm flooding, high winds, extreme heat and air quality, which are displayed on real estate websites including Redfin, Realtor.com and, until recently, Zillow.
Art Carter, the CEO of the California Regional Multiple Listing Service, said in a statement that First Street’s “future predictions ended up being very wrong” on flooding in California.
The group became suspicious after seeing  home listings with a high projected chance of near-future flooding “despite having no flood activity for decades,” Carter said. In addition to Zillow, Carter’s group has also asked Realtor.com, Redfin, and Homes.com to remove First Street’s predictive numbers and flood layer maps from their listings.
“The display of a probability of a specific home flooding this year, or in the next five years, can have a significant impact on the perceived desirability to purchase that property,” he added.
There’s evidence the information is impacting home sales. Zillow’s analysis of its own data found thathomes listed in June 2024 with a high flood risk were less likely to sellby March 2025 than those with a low flood risk. Just 52% of the high-risk homes sold compared to 71% of the low-risk homes.
And First Street says its data is more accurate than limited federal data like FEMA flood maps.
First Street founder and CEO Matthew Eby said his company’s maps outperformed California’s state maps during January’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires, identifying more than 90% of the homes that ultimately burned in the Eaton Fire as being at “severe” or “extreme” risk to wildfire. California’s own analysis put just 21% of the same homes in a “very high” fire hazard zone. The statehas initiated changes to those mapsas a result.
“We take accuracy very seriously, and the data speaks for itself,” Eby told CNN in an email. “When buyers lack access to clear climate-risk information, they make the biggest financial decision of their lives while flying blind.”
A Zillow spokesperson said the site “updated our climate risk product experience to adhere to varying MLS requirements and maintain a consistent experience for all consumers.”  The spokesperson added the company made the policy across the country for “a consistent experience on our site.”
The Zillow spokesperson said First Street data is still linked to its listings, although far less visibly than the data displayed on Redfin and Realtor.com. But each company may take different actions.
“Redfin will continue to provide the best possible estimates of the risks of fires, floods, and storms,” Redfin spokesperson Angela Cherry told CNN in a statement. “Every home is different and no model is perfect, so if sellers believe the information is inaccurate for their listing, they can ask Redfin to remove it.”
Realtor.com spokesperson Sara Wiskerchen said “we are working with CRMLS and our data providers to look into the issues surfaced.”
There’s no easy answer because First Street, and similar groups doing data and modeling for climate risk, are private companies, said Oriana Chegwidden, a research scientist at the nonprofit CarbonPlan.
Even though Eby told CNN that his company’s models “are built on transparent, peer-reviewed science,” independent scientists say it’s hard to verify the accuracy of a private company whose data is not available to the public. First Street has built its public image by sharing maps and modeling results with journalists, including those at CNN. But the company’s business model is based on selling that data to banks, corporations, asset managers and real estate companies. To make the business work, it — and other companies like it — keep a tight lid on how their models function.
And while models that predict climate change on a global level have largely been consistent and accurate, Chegwidden conducted a study in 2024 that found risk modeling can have wide-ranging variations at an individual property level. Many in the climate risk industry also didn’t want to open their models to inspection; of nine companies she and other researchers contacted, only two agreed to participate in the study. (First Street did not participate.)
That makes it hard to determine exactly how accurate the modeling — and climate risk predictions — actually are.
“Yes, it’s hard to predict the future. Yes, people are doing it,” Chegwidden said. “It’s so important for that science to be transparent, because that science is going to influence whether or not someone can get insurance (or) whether or not someone can sell their home.”
But such a public database does not yet exist, and Eby said having the private data accessible to homebuyers is “essential to protecting consumers and preventing lifelong financial consequences.”
The pressure from real estate groups to remove the data “didn’t arise when housing markets were roaring and inventory was plentiful,” Eby said. “It’s happening now, during one of the toughest real-estate environments in decades. All of that adds pressure to close sales however possible. Climate risk data didn’t suddenly become inconvenient; it became harder to ignore in a stressed market.”"
