Kathy Hochul\u2019s decision to rewrite his bill.\nJust before PresidentDonald Trumpsigned an executive order aimed at undercutting state-level AI regulations, news broke that Hochul had severely watered down a state-level bill targeting some of the industry's biggest players, attempting to force them to implement stricter safety measures.\nHer amendments reportedly mirrored a California measure more favorable to major AI firms.\nIn response to Bores' work on the bill, the RAISE Act, the progressive state lawmaker who is running for Congress to replace Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., says he has been the target of a $100 million ad campaign bankrolled by some of the biggest leaders in the AI industry, such as OpenAI President Greg Brockman and the major AI venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\nTRUMP SAYS EVERY AI PLANT BEING BUILT IN US WILL BE SELF-SUSTAINING WITH THEIR OWN ELECTRICITY\n\"My reaction was, \u2018Oh, this is a message to the governor\u2019 \u2014 this is not just about defeating me,\" Bores told Rolling Stone after Hochul amended his bill. \"They want the governor to be intimidated by the idea they might target her next.\"\nNew York State Assemblyman Alex Bores (left) during a hearing questioning witnesses on artificial intelligence Sept. 20, 2024, at the Legislative Office Building in Albany, N.Y.(Will Waldron\/Albany Times Union via Getty Images)\n\"NY can be a leader on critical AI safety, or we can cave to the pressure of the same Big Tech and VC bullies pushing Trump\u2019s AI safety ban,\" New York State Sen.

The Department of Energy oversees the reserve.\nBURGUM CALLS CALIFORNIA A \u2018NATIONAL SECURITY RISK\u2019 AS ENERGY CHIEF WARNS BLUE STATES ARE SKEWING COST AVERAGES\nThe Trump White House said that the administration is gradually refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after it was partially drained under the Biden administration.(Brandon Bell\/Getty Images)\nA Trump official explained that the administration is working to \"gradually\" refill the stash of oil, while citing significant \"damage\" left to the reserve following the Biden administration releasing millions of barrels of oil in 2021 and 2022.\n\"Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous green energy policies sent gas prices soaring across the country, making the past four years painfully unaffordable for Americans filling their gas tanks to commute to work, take their children to school, and travel during the summer and holiday seasons,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital.\n\"In a desperate attempt to provide an illusion of relief during his 2024 campaign, Joe Biden irresponsibly depleted our Strategic Petroleum Reserve \u2014 shamelessly jeopardizing our economic and national security. President Trump\u2019s energy dominance agenda has already brought gas prices down across the country, while gradually replenishing the SPR, and they will continue to drop as we unleash American energy.\"\nBiden released 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2021 to lower gas prices and address the nation's supply chain issues, citing the move was needed after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a \"near economic standstill.\"\nHe upped the ante on draining the SPR in March 2022, announcing that his administration would release one million barrels of oil per day from the SPR for six months to combat rising gas prices. The announcement followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with the U.S. and other allies imposing steep sanctions on oil-rich Russia in response. Biden released roughly 300 million barrels of oil across his four years.\nThe U.S. uses about 20.2 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to theEnergy Information Administration, so the roughly 400 million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve would cover only about 20 days of demand if it were the country\u2019s sole source of crude.\nTRUMP COMPARES REAL WAGES UNDER HIS ADMIN VERSUS BIDEN'S DURING SPEECH CALLING OUT DEM AFFORDABILITY 'HOAX'\nBiden holds the top spot among presidents for releasing the most oil from the SPR, with his administration acknowledging at the time that it was \"unprecedented\" but needed to lower energy prices. SPR levels dropped to a 40-year low of 347 million barrels in July 2023 after the drawdowns in 2021 and 2022, compared to its record high at 727 million barrels under the Obama administration in 2009.\n\"The scale of this release is unprecedented: the world has never had a release of oil reserves at this 1 million per day rate for this length of time,\" the Biden administration said in astatement at the time, pinning blame for the prices on Russia. \"This record release will provide a historic amount of supply to serve as bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up.\"\nOther presidents have released oil from the reserve, including the President George H.W. Bush administration releasing 17.3 million barrels in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm, and the President George W. Bush administration ordering an 11 million barrel drawdown in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina rocked the Gulf Coast.\nPresident Biden in 2021 announced the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve of the Department of Energy to combat high energy prices which are at a seven-year high across the nation prior to the holiday travel season.(Alex Wong\/Getty Images)\nA Trump administration official told Fox Digital that the \"repercussions of this damaging decision\" to release roughly 300 million barrels of oil \"persist.\"\nThe official said that releasing the oil under the Biden administration sparked $280 million incosts, delayed critical infrastructure maintenance, and put \"unprecedented\" wear and tear on storage and injection facilities.\nThe SPR currently holds just more than 400 million barrels, with a capacity of roughly 700 million barrels, Fox Digital learned. Refiling the reserve could cost up to $20 billion, according to the administration official, who underscored that the \"damage the Biden administration did to America\u2019s SPR and national security cannot be overstated.\"\nThe SPR notched its lowest levels in modern history under the Biden administration, though the reserve only held just a few million barrels of oil in the late 1970s and early 1980s as officials worked tofill the reserve.\nFox News Digital reached out to Biden's office for comment on the SPR and Trump administration's comments but did not immediately receive a reply.\nAfter Biden\u2019s record 2022 emergency drawdown, the Biden\u2013Harris administration directed the Energy Department to start repurchasing crude for the SPR at prices well below the roughly $95 per barrel it sold forin 2022.\nCongress needs to appropriate funds in order to refill the reserves. Currently, the Department of Energy has refill authority and funds granted under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" which appropriated $218 million for maintenance and repairs to the storage facilities and $171 million to refill the SPR.\nAppetite amongRepublicansto refill the SPR was apparent earlier in 2025, when House GOP lawmakers unveiled a budget proposal in May that included more than $1.5 billion to replenish and maintain the SPR. The funding was whittled down amid negotiations on the funding bill.\nArmed security stands near an oil pipe at the Bryan Mound facility of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.(Brett Coomer\/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images)\nThe Trump administration told Fox Digital that the Energy Department and Trump are working to gradually refill the reserve and remain committed to their previous pledges to do so, while awaiting additional funding from Congress.\nThe Department of Energy began refilling the SPR in October, Fox Digital learned, in October with a notice of intent to purchase a million barrels of oil, which was followed by the department awarding contracts to begin refilling the reserve. The Department of Energy expects that oil to be delivered to the reserves by the end of 2025.\n'PRICES ARE COMING DOWN': TRUMP HAILS HIS ECONOMY, BLAMES BIDEN AS VOTERS SAY COSTS STILL STING\nThe administration said it is examining other avenues to refill the reserves as it awaits further funding action from Congress, including exchanging 1 million barrels to ExxonMobil in July to address a temporary supply disruption at its Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery. Exxon will return the oil, plus an additional amount\u00a0that will be returned under a negotiated schedule by the third quarter of fiscal year 2026.\nTrump railed against Biden's plan and subsequent release of the oil in his interim between his first and second administration, including in 2021 when he told the New York Post that the reserve should only be tapped during \"serious emergencies, like war, and nothing else.\"\n\"Now I understand that Joe Biden will be announcing an \u2018attack\u2019 on the newly brimming Strategic Oil Reserves so that he could get the close to record-setting high oil prices artificially lowered,\"\u00a0Trump told the outlet at the time.\u00a0\"We were energy independent one year ago, now we are at the mercy of OPEC, gasoline is selling for $7 in parts of California, going up all over the Country, and they are taking oil from our Strategic Reserves.

The report serves as a nationwide barometer of housing stress and shows whether the availability of affordable housing is improving or worsening, and who may be being hurt by the current conditions, which Congress can then use to craft policy.\nPolicymakers use it to gauge gaps in the supply of low-cost rentals, target federal housing programs, and understand trends in who is being left behind. In short, it\u2019s HUD\u2019s way of tracking the renters in the greatest need \u2014 and how the U.S. housing system is failing to meet them.\nTRUMP\u2019S HOUSING CHIEF RIPS POWELL FOR BLOWING MILLIONS ON FED FACELIFT DURING HOUSING CRISIS HE PERPETUATES\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner said his agency will move to an English-only model following President Donald Trump's executive order designating English as the official language of the U.S.(Getty Images)\nTurner told Fox News Digital there are damning findings in this year\u2019s assessment that he places right on the policies of former PresidentJoe Biden\u2019s immigration crisis.\n\"The unchecked illegal immigration and open borders policies allowed by the Biden administration continue to put significant strain on housing, pricing out American families,\" Turner said.\n\"These policies have plagued America\u2019s housing market, but in President Trump, Americans finally have a leader fighting to restore sanity to American immigration policy.\"\nTRUMP'S DHS TOUTS MASSIVE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DEPORTED AS DEMS LASH OUT AT ICE\nBut Jenna Stauffer, Global Real Estate Advisor at Sotheby's International Realty of Key West, told Fox News Digital she didn't think immigration was the primary driver of the \"housing mess we are in.\"\n\"Housing affordability has been unraveling for years, and the problems we\u2019re dealing with go way beyond any one factor,\" she said.\n\"We\u2019ve really been under building for almost two decades. After the Great Recession, construction basically stalled, and it took years to recover. By some estimates, the U.S. is short four to seven million homes, and that long-term shortage is the core issue behind today\u2019s affordability challenges.\"\nHUD's 2025 report found that increased immigration has driven up housing prices, and that the \"unrestricted\" nature of the influx has both strained the housing market and priced-out many American families. The report found that an estimated 15 millionillegal immigrantsconstitute 30% of all foreign-born residents.\nTurner added in separate comments to Fox Business that HUD took away Federal Housing Authority-backed mortgages from illegal immigrants offered during the Biden administration, saying the former president \"turned a blind eye\" to the issue.\nIn California and New York, immigrants have accounted for 100% of all rental growth and over one-half of all growth in owner-occupied housing in recent years, the report found \u2013 while nationally, theforeign-born populationaccounted for more than 60% of the growth in rental demand.\nKRISTI NOEM SAYS BIDEN USED DHS 'TO INVADE THE COUNTRY WITH TERRORISTS'\nNationwide, the foreign-born population accounted for two-thirds of rental demand growth.\nHUD\u2019s report contrasted that figure with the 13% growth attributed to noncitizens in 2019 and 2023\u2019s lookbacks.\n\"This further demonstrates that non-citizen households are playing an increasing role in the household growth that is straining the affordable housing supply,\" the 109-page report said.\nNEW GOP BILL WOULD CUT OFF HOUSING FUNDS TO SANCTUARY CITIES DEFYING TRUMP DHS\nThe agency found that without the migrant surge, housing inventory pressures would have been far lower and prices would not have climbed as sharply, noting roughly 784,000 fewer households would have formed over that period.\nNet additions to the housing market from 2015 onward have not kept up with \"household formation among citizens\" and non-citizen population growth has also inordinately affectedrental markets.\nWorst-case housing reports have been released regularly since 1991, but the 2025 findings mark a sharper warning about the illegal immigration crisis\u2019 impact on the numbers.\nBIPARTISAN PLAN AIMS TO MAKE THE AMERICAN DREAM AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR MILLIONS OF FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS\nIn August, Turnerordered an audit of everypublic housing authority, seeking data on verifiable citizenship of those living in subsidized housing.\n\"No longer will illegal aliens be able to leave citizenship boxes blank or take advantage of HUD-funded housing, riding the coattails of hardworking American citizens,\" Turner said.\n\"Currently, HUD only serves one out of four eligible families due, in part, to the lack of enforcement of prohibition against federally funded assistance to illegal aliens,\" he continued.\nTRUMP'S BORDER MIRACLE: FROM BIDEN'S CHAOTIC IMMIGRATION CRISIS TO 'ALL QUIET' IN RECORD TIME\nVice PresidentJD Vancehighlighted a recent comment from Turner \u2013 who had been responding to a CNBC report that rents have dropped for four straight months.\n\"Six months of zero illegals released into our country. Two million illegals removed. Rents dropped for the fourth straight month. Coincidence? I think not,\" Turner said.\nVance echoed what the agency ultimately would find in its report, remarking that the \"connection between illegal immigration and skyrocketing housing costs is as clear as day.\"\nSEC SCOTT TURNER: BLAME DRUGS AND MENTAL ILLNESS, NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR THE CHAOS GRIPPING OUR STREETS\nHUD\u2019s findings, as expressed by Turner and others prior to the official report, also had other critics.\nHarvard Joint Center For Housing Studies senior research analyst Riordan Frost previously wrote that while the \"surge in immigration\" has affected the market, other factors like the coronavirus pandemic contributed to increases in housing costs during that time in history.\n\"Immigrants play a role in household growth, sometimes to a substantial degree, but housing demand during the pandemic has been primarily shaped by native-born household growth in a time of constrained housing supply,\"Frost said.\nBOMBSHELL REPORT ALLEGES BIDEN TEAM FORCED AIRPORTS TO HOUSE MIGRANTS, RISKING SAFETY\nRep.

McDaniel called on the mayor-elect to fire Khan, President Joe Biden's former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair, who Mamdani appointed as co-chair of his transition team.\nMcDaniel said that if the NYC mayor-elect is really going to be true to his word about lowering costs for New Yorkers, he cannot have someone like Khan in his administration who \"is not only a flashback to the dreaded Biden days that 77 million Americans rejected by re-electing President Trump,\" but also holds a history of \"policy prescriptions [that] have failed before and will again.\"\nMAMDANI ECONOMIC ADVISOR IS REPARATIONS ACTIVIST WHO SAYS 'DEVALUATION OF BLACK LIVES' INGRAINED IN US SYSTEM\nZohran Mamdani's transition co-chair Lina Khan speaks at a press conference Wednesday afternoon in Queens.(Alexi J.

McDaniel's letter said that \"early reports\" from the business community in New York have indicated they are prepared for a \"rehash\" of the playbook Khan ran at the FTC under Biden.\nOne example cited in the letter was Khan's alleged opposition to a proposed merger between Amazon and the Massachusetts-based company iRobot, designer of the popular self-cleaning vacuum called Roomba. According to McDaniel's letter, Khan's opposition contributed to the company's subsequent bankruptcy, and resulted in 350 iRobot employees losing their jobs amid a 31% cut to the company's workforce.

That's why you see the government grows every single year. That's why you see taxes go up most every year as well.\"\nWithe, a critic of both public- and private-sector unions, said private-sector unions at least have an incentive structure based on a company's or industry's bottom line, but public-sector unions, Withe argued, are incentivized by raising taxes and growing government.\n\"When you look at union spending in politics, you have to remember that their goal \u2014 their primary purpose is a business \u2014 so they're there to grow revenue. They're there to gain more revenue than the year previously,\" Withe pointed out. \"The difference with the government union is that that revenue comes from public employees. And the way that you hire more public employees is by raising taxes on the private sector so that you can hire more bureaucrats.\"\nDavid Osborne, senior director of labor policy for the Commonwealth Foundation and co-author of the report, said \"the big question\" from his report is whether rank-and-file union members are aware of how their money is actually being spent.\n\"Years ago, [union members] could expect union executives to use dues to drive member services, including contract negotiations and grievance processing,\" Osborne said. \"Now, union members are unwittingly propping up left-leaning candidates and progressive causes like abortion, critical race theory and defunding the police.\"\nMY TEACHERS UNION CALLS IT REPRESENTATION.

Collectively, the unions spent around $755 million on federal elections and national progressive politics, while their state-level affiliates combined to spend another $160 million on state races and ideological causes. Of that spending, $650 million, or 86%, originated from union membership dues, according to the Commonwealth Foundation.\nThe report notes the unions also collect voluntary political action committee (PAC) deductions from members and their families, which allows the unions to collect money that can then godirectly to candidates,something that is not supposed to be done with members' dues money.

He has led the largest deregulatory initiative in Department of Energy history, cut billions in wasteful green subsidies, and restored a clear path to American energy dominance,\" Jason Isaac, CEO of one of the groups that signed on to the published list of Trump administration energy sector wins, wrote.\n\"He halted dozens of harmful appliance rules, streamlined NEPA, canceled politically driven wind, solar, and carbon-capture spending, reignited U.S. LNG and nuclear development, and used emergency authority to keep critical coal capacity online, so the grid stays stable when it matters most,\" he continued. \"This is what it looks like when Washington finally puts consumers, reliability, and American workers first.\"\nTRUMP ADMIN ANNOUNCES BIG STEP TOWARD \u2018ENERGY DOMINANCE\u2019 WITH MASSIVE ALASKA LNG PROJECT ALLIANCE\nVice President JD Vance, left, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, right, in Greenland while honoring the 55th anniversary of Earth Day 2025.(Reuters)\nGroups from the letter include the Heartland Institute, the Energy and Environmental Legal Institute, Truth In Energy and Climate, the American Energy Institute and others.\nSeveral of the \"wins\" they touted focused on deregulation, such as the rescission or blocking of 47 specific regulations and standards for a variety of consumer appliances, reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) aimed at reducing permitting delays for energy infrastructure, the cancellation of \"billions of dollars\" in funding for wind and solar projects, the fast-tracking of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects that the coalition says were \"stymied\" under the Biden administration and an initiative to critically review the impact of greenhouse gasses on the U.S. climate, among a list of other reforms.\nHowever, environmental groups who spoke to Fox News Digital about the conservative coalition's victory lap argued the recent reforms actually serve to help big businesses and not the average person. They noted that the viewpoint that PresidentDonald Trump'senvironmental agenda is making the country stronger is also a facade.\n\"These policies might be good for Trump and Wright's rich corporate buddies, but they are downright evil for working people,\" Tim Donaghy, Greenpeace USA's research director, told Fox News Digital. \"The decisions made\u00a0in the last nine months are literally sucking money out of Americans' wallets and putting it into oil industry bank accounts, while pretending they're making the country stronger.\"\nDonaghy said that President Trump's plan to increase energy exports, for example, \"will increase\" costs for American families and exacerbate climate change, which he argued was another driver of increased housing insurance costs for families.\nCCP-LINKED FIRMS QUIETLY HOLD STAKES IN US SOLAR COMPANIES FUELING DEM'S GREEN PUSH\n\"The sad thing is that the Trump\u00a0administration's policies are creating more pollution that will make Americans sick.

These \u2018wins\u2019 all but guarantee it will go up,\" Donaghy concluded.\nThe \"wins\" touted by the \"American Energy Dominance Coalition\" did not exclusively include deregulation efforts in theenergy sector,but also featured increased investments in nuclear energy production. The list also praised Secretary Wright for launching a critical review earlier this summer looking into the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the U.S. climate, as well as a study focused on identifying pipeline needs and potential permitting reforms that could be used to help speed up oil and gas production.\nSome of the additional deregulation \"wins\" listed by the coalition include the termination of $3.7 billion in carbon-capture and decarbonization grants, the cancellation of \"hundreds-of-millions\" in electric-vehicle and battery manufacturing grants and a push towards rescinding energy-efficiency standards for federal billions, which the conservative coalition argued could lead to saving millions of dollars in \"unnecessary upgrades.\"\n\"Chris Wright has done an amazing job of actually prioritizing American energy development and affordability rather than globalist misguided climate agendas,\" Heartland Institute President James Taylor said. \"American energy policy must continue to bolster affordable and reliable domestic energy sources rather than the agendas of foreign nations that are often hostile to American interests.\"\nMeanwhile, Sal Nuzzo, executive director of Consumers Defense, also praised Secretary Wright and his administration's \"most sweeping de-regulatory initiative in U.S. history,\" for overturning \"burdensome regulations\" that Nuzzo says hurt both consumers and businesses.\nNuzzo also pointed out that the Trump administration has taken a stand against \"politically motivated\" environmental, social, governance (ESG) \"schemes,\" which he said have been inflating energy costs and weakening U.S. independence while also undermining the free market system.\nBut the Environmental Working Group's (EWG) Bernadette Del Chiaro, who is EWG's senior vice president for its California-based operations, dismissed that the policy \"wins\" touted by these conservative groups were actually \"wins\" for the American people.

{"title":"A solution to the housing affordability problem: Marriage","date":1764547200000,"body":"Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway and former Democratic Pennsylvania congressman Patrick Murphy discuss the White House\u2019s focus on affordability ahead of Thanksgiving on \u2018The Story with Martha MacCallum.\u2019\nA key aspect of the suddenly trendy \"affordability\" problem is that young adults are said to be priced out of thehousing market. The statistics appear to be compelling. Per the National Association of Realtors, \"Today's young adults continue to face delays in homeownership compared to past generations at the same age. Not only is the homeownership rate lower for those under 35 today compared to past generations, but the first-time buyer share is lower, and the age of first-time buyers is older than seen historically.\"\nThe most obvious approach to helping Gen Zers buy homes is to lower costs by increasing available supply. To be sure, this supply-side solution has its place. But here\u2019s something else to consider: marriage.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that high housing costs coincide with another socioeconomic trend:low marriage rates. Per the Institute of Family Studies, \"only about 60% of 35-year-old men are ever married today, down from 90% in 1980.\" And, \"just 20% of 25-year-old women and 23% of 25-year-old men have ever married today. These are close to the lowest levels ever observed for marriage rates.\"\nThe decline in marriage has several important implications for housing costs.\nTRUMP\u2019S\u00a050-YEAR\u00a0MORTGAGE JUST INTRODUCES A NEW KIND OF DEBT\nOne way to defeat the affordability crunch is the most traditional way \u2014 marriage.(iStock)\nThe most obvious, of course, is the fact that two incomes are better than one when it comes to saving for a down payment andpaying monthly mortgage costs. Affordability that arises from pooling income \u2014 and aspirations \u2014 reflects an assumption about marriage that has faded.\nBrad Wilcox of the Institute of Family Studies calls it \"cornerstone marriage\" \u2014 the idea of starting out poor and working together to improve a shared lot. He distinguishes between that and \"capstone marriage\" \u2014 wedding once one (or two) have become affluent enough to afford a destination wedding and a house. In other words, it\u2019s not just the marriage rate that has declined, it\u2019s the idea of the role of marriage, that has.\nThen there\u2019s the less obvious but crucial side effect of a low marriage rate: the establishment of more small, often single-person households creates a need for more housing for which young adults must compete when supply lags. This is not a marginal demographic change. Marriage rates among young adults have fallen sharply over time, meaning fewer couples, more single adults, and therefore more households competing for limited units.\nOn this point, census data is clear. The average household size has steadily decreased, from 3.3 persons per household in 1960 to just 2.4 in 2024. At the same time, the number of overall households has steadily climbed, from 117 million in 2010 to 132 million in 2024. It\u2019s an increase disproportionate to the increase in population, as measured by the number of households per million Americans, which increased during the same period from 380,744 to 390,171. That same figure increased from 295,090 in 1960.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThat increase, moreover, is driven by the fact that more of us live alone. Between 2010 and 2024, the number of single-person households increased from 31 million to 38 million, while the number of three-person households barely increased, from 18 million to 19 million. Even that figure may not reflect an increase of married couples with a child; many Gen Z members live with their parents into their 30s. In 1960, just 11% of men and 7% of women ages 25 to 34 lived with their parents, whereas in 2022, 19% of men and 12% of women were living in their parents\u2019 homes.\nIt should be no surprise that Americans are said to be enduring anepidemic of loneliness: many of us are literally alone at home.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe increase in single-person households reflects more than thedeclining marriage rate, of course. Women live longer than men and thus elderly women tend to live alone. Men age 75 and older are nearly twice as likely (67%) as women (35%) to live with a spouse. Government housing policy adds to the problem.\u00a0Public housing authorities give priority to those of lowest incomes for public housing or housing vouchers. Those inevitably turn out to be single mothers with children or older women without spouses. Only 3% of public or subsidized housing households are two adults with children.\nIt\u2019s self-evident, though, that marriage can serve to ameliorate the housing affordability challenge in two ways: by serving to pool incomes and by reducing the demand for standalone households.

Richard Hudson says 2025 elections \"wake up call\" to conservatives to \"show up and vote\" in midterms.\nIn the wake of last year's tumultuous presidential election, which exhausted many Americans, it was expected to be quiet on the 2025 campaign trail.\nBut with PresidentDonald Trumpback in the White House and Democrats itching to rebound after last year's ballot box setbacks, 2025's off-year elections were anything but sedate.\nHere are five of the biggest moments that shaped the campaign trail.\nJust eight days into Trump's second term in the White House, demoralized Democrats had something to cheer about.\nSETTING THE STAGE: WHAT THE 2025 ELECTIONS SIGNAL FOR NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERM SHOWDOWNS\nPresident Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second term in the White House on Jan. 20, 2025, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C.(Morray Gash\/AFP via Getty Images)\nDemocrat Mike Zimmer defeated Republican Katie Whittington in a special state Senate election in Iowa, flipping a Republican-controlled vacant seat in a district that Trump had carried by 21 points less than three months earlier.\nZimmer's victory triggered a wave of Democrats overperforming in special elections and regularly scheduled off-year ballot box contests.\nIn Iowa, Democrats in August flipped another Republican-held seat in a state Senate special election, breaking the GOP's supermajority in the upper chamber for the first time in three years.\n\"Since the president was inaugurated back in January, there's been 45 elections on the ballot. Democrats have overperformed in all of them to the tune of about 16 percentage points on average,\" Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin touted in a Fox News Digital interview days ahead of the2025 elections.\nIt was the issue that boosted Trump and Republicans in the 2024 elections, as they won back the White House and Senate majority and kept control of the House.\nBut a year later, the economy, and everyday expenses in particular, are working against the president and his party in the 2025 elections.\nFOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SAY WHITE HOUSE IS DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD ON ECONOMY\nDemocrats, with an across-the-board focus on affordability, enjoyed sweeping success at the ballot box earlier this month, with double-digit victories in the gubernatorial showdowns in blue-leaning but competitive New Jersey and Virginia, as well as major victories in high-profile contests in battlegrounds Georgia and Pennsylvania and solidly blue New York City and California.\nDemocratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill votes on Election Day, in Montclair, New Jersey, on Nov. 4, 2025.(Paul Steinhauser\/Fox News)\n\"Voters are remarkably consistent in their priorities: the economy, the economy, the economy,\" noted Wayne Lesperance, a veteran political scientist and president of New England College.\n\"When you win an election, voters expect you are going to do something to address those concerns and the reality is that the questions of affordability remain unchanged in their importance to the everyday voter.\"\nVirginia Democrats were cruising toward convincing victories in the commonwealth's statewide elections when a scandal sent shockwaves up and down the ballot.\nDemocratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones instantly went into crisis mode after controversial texts were first reported earlier by the National Review in early October.\nJay Jones addresses supporters after winning the Democratic nomination for Virginia attorney general as wife Mavis Jones looks on in Norfolk, on June 17, 2025.(Trevor Metcalfe\/The Virginian-Pilot\/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)\nJones acknowledged and apologized for texts he sent in 2022, when he compared then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert to mass murderers Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, adding that if he was given two bullets, he would use both against the GOP lawmaker to shoot him in the head.\nBut Jones faced a chorus of calls from Republicans to drop out of the race.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE 2025 ELECTIONS\nAnd the GOP leveraged the explosive revelations up the ballot, forcing Democratic Party nominee, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, back on defense in a campaign where she was seen as the frontrunner against Republican rival Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\nEarle-Sears didn't waste an opportunity to link Spanberger to Jones. And during last month's chaotic and only gubernatorial debate, where Earle-Sears repeatedly interrupted Spanberger, the GOP gubernatorial nominee called on her Democratic rival to tell Jones to end his attorney general bid.\n\"The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent,\" Spanberger said at the debate. But she neither affirmed nor pulled back her support of Jones.\nWhile the scandal grabbed national headlines, in the end it didn't slow down the Democrats, as Spanberger crushed Earle-Sears by 15 points. Democrats won the separate election for lieutenant governor by 11 points and Jones even pulled off a 6-point victory over Republican incumbent Jason Miyares.\nAiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections, Trump in June first floated the idea of rare but not unheard of mid-decade congressional redistricting.\nThe mission was simple: redraw congressional district maps in red states to pad the GOP's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\nTrump's first target: Texas.\nA month later, when asked by reporters about his plan to add Republican-leaning House seats across the country, the president said, \"Texas will be the biggest one. And that\u2019ll be five.\"\nThe push by Trump and his political team triggered a high-stakes redistricting showdown with Democrats to shape the 2026 midterm landscape in the fight for the House majority.\nRepublican Gov.Greg Abbottof Texas called a special session of the GOP-dominated state legislature to pass the new map.\nELECTION REFLECTION: 'DEMOCRATS FLIPPED THE SCRIPT' ON AFFORDABILITY IN BALLOT BOX SHOWDOWNS\nBut Democratic state lawmakers, who broke quorum for two weeks as they fled Texas in a bid to delay the passage of the redistricting bill, energized Democrats across the country.\nAmong those leading the fight against Trump's redistricting was Democratic Gov.Gavin Newsomof California.\nGov. Gavin Newsom speaks during an election night press conference at a California Democratic Party office on Nov. 4, 2025, in Sacramento.(Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez\/AP Photo)\nCalifornia voters earlier this month overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack the left-leaning state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democratic-dominated legislature.\nThat is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which aimed to counter the move by Texas to redraw their maps.\nMeanwhile, an opinion by two federal judges in Texas this month delivered a blow to Trump and Republicans, by ruling that the state can't use the newly drawn map in next year's elections. Texas Republicans say they'll appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.\nBut the fight has spread beyond Texas and California.\nRight-tilting Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. And red-leaning Indiana, Florida and Kansas are also mulling redrawing their maps.\n\"We must keep the Majority at all costs,\" Trump wrote on social media this month.\nIllinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are also taking steps or seriously considering redistricting.\nAnd in a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge\u00a0this month rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nZohran Mamdani's convincing June 24 victory in New York City's Democratic Party mayoral primary was the political earthquake that rocked the nation's most populous city and sent powerful shockwaves across the country.\nThe capturing of the Democratic nomination by the now-34-year-old socialist state lawmaker over frontrunner former Gov.Andrew Cuomoand nine other candidates propelled Mamdani to this month's general election victory.\nZohran Mamdani speaks to supporters during a primary election night gathering on June 24, 2025, in the Queens borough of New York City.(Michael M. Santiago\/Getty Images)\nWhile Mamdani's 9-point general election victory is a shot in the arm for the rise of the socialist movement as it battles moderate Democrats for the future of the party, it also appears to be the political gift that keeps on giving for Republicans, as they aim to paint all Democrats as far-left radicals.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) was one of the first out of the gate to capitalize on the leftward lurch, firing off an email release minutes after Mamdani's primary victory, arguing that \"every vulnerable House Democrat will own him, and every Democrat running in a primary will fear him.\"\nAnd this month, immediately after Mamdani became mayor-elect, the NRCC claimed \"the new face of the Democrat Party just dropped, and it's straight out of a socialist nightmare.\"\nPresident Donald Trump met with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, in the Oval Office at the White House, on Nov. 21, 2025.(Jim Watson\/AFP via Getty Images)\nBut Trump's very chummy meeting with Mamdani recently at the White House seemed to undercut the GOP strategy to use the mayor-elect as a human cudgel.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nDemocrats insist that the effort to link Mamdani is a distraction from Republicans' inability to deal with the affordability issue.\n\"Republican operatives in D.C. know they can\u2019t win on the issues, so we\u2019re seeing them melt down in real time, resorting to ineffective boogeyman attacks.

{"title":"BROADCAST BIAS: Maybe Nancy Pelosi could get on the Mount Rushmore of House speakers","date":1764374400000,"body":"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nFormer House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, D-Calif., finally announced what everyone expected, that she would not run for office again now that she\u2019s 85. It\u2019s the end of an era, an era of broadcast TV flattery and shamelessness. Pelosi has wielded great power over her members, and also great power over the national media. She viciously attacks any reporter that asks her a question she doesn\u2019t want to answer. In recent years, the big networks have been putty in her hands.\nThis starts with the issue of her husband Paul\u2019s aggressive financial trading, and her quiet opposition to any attempt to restrict members of Congress from trading stocks, which is on the agenda again. Back in 2011, CBS\u2019s \"60 Minutes\" cooperated with conservative author Peter Schweizer when his book \"Throw Them All Out\" was published. Since then, the issue has largely vanished.\nA New York Post analysisrevealed that before first taking office in 1987, Pelosi and her husband reported between $610,000 and $785,000 in stocks in their portfolio \u2014 worth $133.7 million today, according to the latest estimates from Quiver Quantitative. That means that Nancy Pelosi grew her little nest egg by 16,930%.\nIn the last four years, the gush from the press has been remarkably excessive. Stock trading didn\u2019t come up in 2022 in a George Stephanopoulos interview on ABC\u2019s \"This Week.\" Stephanopoulos asked then-Speaker Pelosi: \"the [Biden] White House is warning of an imminent invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainians seem to think that\u2019s all hype. Do you believe that Putin is poised to invade?\" Stephanopoulos even asked Pelosi if \"Congress [is] doing everything you can to prevent an invasion?\" Most laughably, he asked her what \"should President Putin know from you, the speaker of the House, about the consequences of invasion?\"\nFIVE TIMES NANCY PELOSI LOST HER COOL WITH THE MEDIA\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi being interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025.(Screenshot\/CNN)\nWhen Democrats lost the House in the midterms, Pelosi relinquished her post as Democrat leader, but the encomiums never stopped. On CBS\u2019s \"Sunday Morning\" in early 2024, substitute host Tracy Smith announced, \"House Speaker Emerita that has a new book out, \u2018The Art of Power\u2019 \u2014 an art which Nancy Pelosi is something of a master.\"\nPelosi also gushed, proclaiming PresidentJoe Bidenwas at the \"top of his game. Such a consequential president of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of president of the United States.\" Lesley Stahl asked if she was serious: \"Lincoln and Joe Biden?\" Pelosi underlined it: \"You got Teddy Roosevelt up there, and he\u2019s wonderful. I don\u2019t say take him down, but you can add Biden.\"\nStahl just had to follow up that comedy with flattery: \"If there were a Mount Rushmore for speakers of the House, Nancy Pelosi would certainly be up there, commemorating her 20 years as acommanding leader in Congress.\" If there's a stellar achievement on Pelosi's r\u00e9sum\u00e9, it has to be how impressively she and her husband have enriched themselves while she was in \"public service.\"\nNANCY PELOSI'S CRITICS CELEBRATE RETIREMENT ANNOUNCEMENT\nTwo weeks before the 2024 election, CNN and PBS host Christiane Amanpour read a virulently anti-Trump passage from Pelosi\u2019s book. It was about his \"repeatedly stomping out of meetings, his foul mouth, his pounding on tables, his temper tantrums, his disrespect for our nation\u2019s patriots, and his total separation from reality and actual events.\" Then Amanpour asked: \"How did you deal with that? And do you think this country, your country, can survive another term?\" What would America do without Pelosi?\nOn the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 riot, \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Lester Holt was a soft touch. He walked through the hallways of the Capitol with her and noted they \"desecrated your office\" and one rioter wrote he wanted to \"shoot her in her freaking brain.\" Pelosi said the memory \"breaks your heart. It\u2019s like somebody in the White House dropped a bomb on the Congress.\"\nHolt concluded with the devout Catholic angle: \"You\u2019ve been very vocal in the past about praying for your adversaries.\" She said, \"I always do,\" but the current Republican Party \"melted down into a cult.\"\nPerhaps the most servile interviewer was \"PBS NewsHour\" co-anchor Geoff Bennett, who interviewed Pelosi in front of a PBS crowd in California in May. He began by gushing to the crowd that Pelosi, who did the interview remotely from Boston, is \"known for herpolitical leadership, her sharp insights and her real singular ability to keep Democrats united.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nBizarrely, Bennett expressed shock that the Democrats weren\u2019t getting credit for the economy: \"Having coveredDemocratic policies, you can say objectively that Democrats did have policies that benefited the middle class! And Joe Biden spent a lot of political capital passing them into law and yet it didn\u2019t seem to resonate, didn\u2019t connect with the American people in this last election.\"\nStahl just had to follow up that comedy with flattery: \"If there were a Mount Rushmore for speakers of the House, Nancy Pelosi would certainly be up there, commemorating her 20 years as a commanding leader in Congress.\"\nPelosi generously said the stupid voters shouldn\u2019t be blamed: \"When somebody doesn't get a message, it's not because of them.

{"title":"Trump is making life affordable again for every American, and here's how","date":1764288000000,"body":"National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to weigh in on the potential economic fallout if Trump\u2019s tariffs are struck down in the Supreme Court and rising tensions over China\u2019s rare-earth minerals.\nDemocrats\u2019 favorite word lately is \"affordability.\" They have painted the false narrative that the election of socialist Mayor Zohran\u00a0Mamdani in solidly blue New York City or Democrat Gov. Abigail Spanberger in solidly blue Virginia were somehow referenda on President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. This fallacy not only ignores the recent past but also misses the facts immediately in front of us that Trump\u2019s policies are making America affordable again.\nPrices soared during the Biden administration. Inflation rose at a near 5% annualized rate during his term. Such a disaster is second only to the severe Carter-led inflation of the 1970s, which collapsed U.S. living standards. Contrast this with Trump\u2019s first term, when inflation rose at less than a 2% annualized rate.\nThe memory of low inflation and strongeconomic growthduring Trump\u2019s first term inspired Americans to re-elect him for a second term. Voters put their trust in Trump\u2019s stewardship after a disastrous four years of economic hardship under Biden.\u00a0Immediately after taking office, Trump began laying the groundwork for a Golden Age economy. While there is still much work ahead to help Americans out of the hole created by the Biden administration, we are making progress.\nThe first step was passing theOne Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), which will help Make America Affordable Again. There are three key provisions in the OBBB that will boost take-home worker pay.\nTRUMP FLIPS DEMS' 'AFFORDABILITY' SCRIPT, TURNING BUZZWORD INTO MAGA MATERIAL AS MAMDANI VISIT LOOMS\nPresident Donald Trump meets with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani (L) in the Oval Office of the White House on Nov. 21, 2025, in Washington, DC.(Andrew Harnick\/Getty Images)\nFirst is permanent full expensing ofbusiness investment, or what is commonly referred to as capital expenditures (or \"capex\"). Thanks to this bold tax incentive, companies can now write off the full cost of purchasing computers, industrial machinery, software and any other equipment. When firms raise their capex, productivity increases, since workers have additional capital to produce the goods and services businesses and consumers want. Greater productivity, in turn, raises household living standards by providing companies the ability to pay their workers more. Economic history is replete with examples when surging productivity produced large increases in worker wages.\nThe second provision in the OBBB dovetails with the capex incentive but may be even more powerful. Companies can now deduct the entire cost ofbuilding a manufacturing plantor agricultural structure in the first year of construction.\nIn the past, companies had to wait nearly 40 years to depreciate the full cost of factories and farm structure. But not anymore. This novel tax incentive will lead to a massive increase in industrial building and support reshoring of our supply chains. With that will comehigh-paying construction jobs. And when the project is done, there will be high-paying jobs inside those structures, where workers will be using the newest technologies thanks to the capex incentives. The effect will be an industrial boom.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIn tandem, a capex and industrial construction boom will increase the economy\u2019s underlying productive capacity, which in the past has always been disinflationary. This means that inflation is poised to fall much further, thereby giving workers an added lift. This is a one-two punch in restoring worker purchasing power because nominal wages will be rising at the same time inflation will be falling. The upshot is a powerful historical gain in real wages, similar but even bigger than Trump\u2019s first term.\nThe third provision that will improve affordability is notax on tips or overtime pay. By eliminating these taxes, working Americans will get to keep more of their hard-earned income. This is critical to restoring household finances to lower- and middle-class families, who suffered disproportionately under the prior administration. Real after-tax wages for blue collar workers are poised to soar thanks to Trump\u2019s policies and economic vision.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nFrom higher take-home pay for hardworking families totax incentivesthat will drive a disinflationary boom, the One Big Beautiful Bill was engineered to Make America Affordable Again.

{"title":"This Black Friday, don\u2019t let \u2018Swipeflation\u2019 swipe $1,400 of your holiday cash","date":1764115200000,"body":"Fox News correspondent Alexis McAdams reports on retailers bracing for the holiday shopping season on 'Your World.'\nBlack Fridayis the\u00a0busiest\u00a0shopping day of the year, and most of us approach it with a plan. We hunt for deals, compare prices and try to stretch our dollars a little further. What few people think about is the cost that gets added at the very moment we tap or insert a credit card. It\u2019s called a swipe fee, and it hurts consumers and small businesses alike.\nEvery time you pay with a credit card, the bank and the card network take a percentage of the purchase. For each $100 spent, anywhere from $2 to $4 goes to them even before the store gets the rest. Most shoppers never notice. And with razor-thin profits in retail and food industries, that 2% to 4% can be as much or more than the small business\u00a0makes\u00a0on the sale.\nIn 2024, these swipe fees added a\u00a0record $187 billion total, or about $1,400 in extra costs for every household. Swipeflation is real. That helps explain why more stores now add credit card fees or offer discounts for paying with cash. A recent WalletHub\u00a0survey\u00a0found that 80% of consumers reported paying a surcharge on a credit card purchase in the past year.\nKURT 'THE CYBER GUY' KNUTSSON'S TIPS FOR SAFE HOLIDAY SHOPPING\nShop owners and restaurateurs are not trying to nickel-and-dime customers. They\u2019re just trying to entice customers to use lower-cost forms of payment like cash or debit, which don\u2019t come with the same high swipe fees that credit card companies charge. After years of inflation, higher rent, increased labor costs and rising supply prices, they are just trying to stay in business. About 92% of small business owners say their\u00a0costs\u00a0have increased since 2020, and rising costs still top their list of\u00a0concerns\u00a0in 2025.\nThis holiday season, be careful how you pay for your gifts to avoid \"swipeflation.\"(iStock)\nThe irony is that inflation is a boon for credit card company profits. As restaurants, groceries and household goods get more expensive, card companies collect more money without offering anything additional in return. Picture your local caf\u00e9 after a day of shopping. The cost of a basic meal has climbed about 40% since 2019 due toinflation in food and labor costs. What used to be a $15 burger, fries, and drink now costs $21. Families pay more at the counter, and credit card companies come out ahead because they collect a percentage of every sale.\nPROTECT YOUR DATA BEFORE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SCAMS STRIKE\nMany consumers stick with credit cards because they want the rewards. Airline miles, hotel points or cash back can feel like a perk. But research\u00a0shows\u00a0that the credit card rewards game only works out well for the very highest earners. When you factor in how built-in swipe fees increase the cost of almost everything consumers buy, most of us actually lose between $300 to $500 each year, even after counting credit card rewards.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThere is good news. Consumers have more control over these costs than they might think, which could come in handy during the biggest shopping season of the year. A few small changes can help youprotect your walletand support the local businesses you care about.\nFirst, take a moment to read the merchant\u2019s policy on credit card fees. Sometimes it\u2019s on a sign at check-out; sometimes it\u2019s at the bottom of the bill. Consider taking advantage of discounts merchants offer when paying with cash or debit. If the business doesn\u2019t offer a discount, you might ask them to consider that option in the future. Otherwise, they are probably building in the swipe fee into the cost of everything, even if you pay with cash.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nYou can also apply these tips onGiving Tuesday. The same 2% to 4% swipe fees apply to online donations made with credit cards as well. Using a debit card or sending money directly from a bank account helps your donation go further.\nMillions of Americans will swipe their cards without a second thought this Black Friday. Be an informed consumer and know before you swipe. Choosing how to pay can be just as important as choosing where to shop. Behind every one of those transactions is a small business trying to keep its doors open and keep prices reasonable for shoppers. Understanding swipeflation, and adjusting how you pay, can make a real difference for both your budget and your community.\nKaren Harned is a small business advocate and former executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Legal Center.

But rare earths are only a small window into the power that China could have over the U.S. economy as we start adopting tomorrow\u2019s technologies.\nThree technologies stand out as especially critical to America\u2019s national security as we look out over the next decade:artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology. Much like China can exert leverage over U.S. manufacturing through rare earths today, we are at risk of significant and growing Chinese leverage in these foundational technologies.\nIn fact, American dependence on Chinese supply chains is already becoming evident.American leadership in AIhinges on U.S. data centers maintaining access to specialized chemicals, printed circuit boards and networking equipment from China. China controls critical inputs for quantum computing, including cooling equipment, precision lasers and several essential minerals.\nCHINA WEAPONIZED SCIENCE AGAINST THE US. WE'VE FIGURED OUT A KEY ELEMENT THEY MISSED\nPerhaps most concerning, China is the sole supplier of at least one critical ingredient for more than a third of nearly 2,000 U.S.-approved medicines, including amoxicillin, one of the most widely prescribed antibiotics, according to a recent study.\nShipping containers at the container terminal of the port of Oakland, California, Oct. 28, 2021. (Reuters\/Carlos Barria)\nThe United States still holds powerful cards to play. The U.S.private sector leadsthe world in spending on research and development, and U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world, capable of financing ambitious projects. The talented American workforce, from machinists to STEM researchers, is well-positioned to build and benefit from the return of critical supply chains.\nBut creative incentives are needed to unleash these advantages. Our newreportdetails how to do it. The United States must act now and bear the costs to de-risk critical supply chains, or it may pay a much higher price later if tensions escalate. Building on the Trump administration\u2019s progress in rare earths, the U.S. government should incentivize domestic production of several dozen critical inputs for semiconductors and data centers, including various chemicals and hardware components, as well as essential materials for quantum computing and biotechnology, like cooling equipment and drug inputs.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nGovernment action is also needed to mobilizeprivate investmenttoward quantum computing and biotechnology. The Department of Defense should use its procurement power, along with contracting milestones, to create demand and competition for the delivery of a viable quantum computer that is powerful and reliable enough to solve real-world problems faster than today\u2019s best supercomputers. Incentivizing private investment into biomanufacturing hubs nationwide would help smaller firms bring new technologies to market by co-funding shared manufacturing infrastructure and easing regulations for expansion.\nWhile economic security begins at home, America is not alone in this race. The European Union, Japan and South Korea have pledged investments that could help strengthen U.S. manufacturing and critical supply chains. When the U.S. government stockpiles essential drug ingredients or critical minerals, it should look to trusted markets. Several allies have capabilities that could help accelerate and expand new sources of critical minerals, as illustrated by the recent framework struck by the United States and Australia.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nWe know from firsthand experience that the U.S. government can utilize its full toolkit for today\u2019s era of economic warfare and position itself to compete in the technologies that have yet to arrive. U.S. agencies and departments are often too siloed to have a full view of today\u2019s vulnerabilities or those risks just beginning to emerge. Establishing an Economic Security Center would strengthen government coordination, upgrade technical expertise and deepen partnerships with the private sector.\nThere is strong bipartisan support for strengthening critical supply chains and significant progress upon which to build.

The Baby Bonds would be given a certain amount of seed funding depending upon determined need, and would grow until the kids become adults and can use the money.\nHamilton has argued that one-time reparations payments do not go far enough and steps, such as the Baby Bonds proposal, should be taken to help Black folks garner ownership of \"means of production in American society.\" Meanwhile, Hamilton has been criticized for allegedly wanting to add Black immigrants to reparations policies, as opposed to making them exclusively for the descendants of slavery.\nYvette Carnell, a prominent activist and co-founder of the American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS) movement, has also called Hamilton\"clueless\"and accused the scholar of kowtowing to whichever politician is in power.\nDarrick Hamilton, professor at the New School (right) speaks during the Bloomberg Equality Summit in New York, March 22, 2022.(Jeenah Moon\/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\"The racial wealth gap is such that the typical Black family has about 10 cents on the dollar as a typical white family,\" Hamilton said during a 2020 podcast episode on Freakonomics Radio. \"That history of racial disparity, as it relates to wealth-building, certainly didn\u2019t end with slavery,\" Hamilton added. \"There was the Homestead Act.

Ranchers and agricultural economists alike say rebuilding will take years andbeef pricesaren\u2019t likely to ease anytime soon.\n\"The biggest thing has been drought,\" said Eric Belasco, head of the agricultural economics department at Montana State University.\nBEEF PRICES ARE CLOSE TO RECORD HIGHS \u2014 BUT AMERICANS AREN\u2019T CUTTING BACK\nHe said years of dry weather have wiped out grasslands across the West and Plains, leaving ranchers without enough feed or water to sustain their herds. Many have been forced to sell cattle early, even the cows needed to produce the next generation of calves, making it hard to rebuild.\n\"It\u2019s not going to be a quick fix, you\u2019re not going to solve it overnight,\" Belasco told Fox News Digital.\nRanchers have sold off many of their cattle in order to cope with rising prices.(Melissa Phillip\/Houston Chronicle\/Getty Images)\nBelasco said the aftereffects of years of drought are still being felt and until ranchers can rebuild their herds, consumers will keep paying the price.\n\"The primary reason you see prices so high is because we haven\u2019t seen any kind of inventory rebuilding,\" he said. \"Until you see that rebuild, you probably won\u2019t see prices coming back down again.\"\nThat slow rebuilding is a challenge for the cattle industry, according to Derrell Peel, a professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University.\n\"The fact of the matter is there\u2019s really nothing anybody can do to change this very quickly,\" Peel said. \"We\u2019re in a tight supply situation that took several years to develop, and it\u2019ll take several years to get out of it.\"\nPeel, who specializes in livestock marketing, said there\u2019s no quick way to ease pressure on beef prices, since it takes roughly two years to bring animals to market and several years to rebuild herds.\nTRUMP'S BEEF IMPORT PLAN IGNORES KEY ISSUE SQUEEZING AMERICAN CATTLE RANCHERS\nEven as ranchers wait for herds to recover, parched conditions are working against them, turning pastures to dust and feed into a luxury.\nResearch from the Kansas City Federal Reserve found that with each step up in drought severity, cattle-producing regions see about a 12% drop in hay production, a 5% rise in hay prices, a 1% reduction in herd size and a 4% decrease in farm income.\nTo cope, many ranchers are shrinking their herds. A 2022 Farm Bureau survey found that about two in three ranchers have sold animals off, leaving them with roughly one-third fewer cattle than before.\nRanchers and agricultural economists alike say rebuilding the cattle inventory will take years.(Ricky Carioti\/The Washington Post\/Getty Images)\nFew people see the challenges of ranching more clearly than Cole Bolton, owner of K&C Cattle Company, whose pastures stretch along the soft edge of the Texas Hill Country.\n\"I think it's going to take a while to fix this crisis that we're in with the cattle shortage. My message to consumers is simple, folks, be patient. We've got to build back our herds,\" Bolton told Fox News Digital.\nBolton said the region, known for its red dirt and family-run ranches, has gone nearly three months without rain. While showers were finally arriving, he noted that the cattle industry has weathered one setback after another, from market turmoil to extreme conditions, over the past five years.\nThe growing strain highlights how persistent drought is reshaping the ranching industry and tightening the nation\u2019s livestock supply.\nThat pressure is being felt not just on ranches but also at thegrocery store.\nAccording to USDA data, the average retail price of beef rose from about $8.51 a pound in August 2024 to $9.85 a pound a year later, a gain of roughly 16%.\nThe \"5-market steer price\" represents what ranchers earn for live cattle before they\u2019re processed into meat. The \"farm-to-retail\" spread reflects everything that happens after that \u2013 the costs and profits tied to slaughtering, processing, packaging, shipping and selling beef in stores.\nMuch of that work \u2014 and the profits it generates \u2014 are concentrated among the industry\u2019s \"big four\"meatpackers: Tyson Foods, JBS, Cargill and National Beef.\nTogether, these data points show that while ranchers are earning slightly more for their cattle than they were a few years ago, the biggestpriceincreases are happening well after the animals leave the pasture.\nDespite the markups between the ranch and the grocery store, demand hasn\u2019t wavered. Americans are still buying beef more than ever.\nAmericans are still buying beef even as prices climb to nearly $10 a pound.(Jim Watson\/AFP\/Getty Images)\nBeef remains the dominant player in the fresh-meat aisle, with $44.3 billion in sales over the past year, a 12% increase that outpaced chicken, pork and turkey, according to Beef Research, a contractor to the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nGlynn Tonsor, a professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University, told Fox News Digital that strong consumer demand will continue to drivebeef priceshigher.\n\"There\u2019s nothing that forces me or you or anybody else when we go into the grocery store to pay more for beef. People are choosing to,\" he said. \"The consumer desire for beef is strong and, regardless of the supply-side situation, that has the effect of pulling prices up.\"\nAmanda covers the intersection of business and geopolitics for Fox News Digital.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/americas-smallest-cattle-herd-70-years-means-rebuilding-take-years-beef-prices-could-stay-high","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":0,"topic_stocks":1,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":0,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

There\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s been a tough time for America\u2019s farmers and ranchers, which is why I\u2019m working to get them the assistance they need.\nEarlier this year, I was proud to support the major farm bill reforms led by my fellow Arkansan and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Republican Sen. John Boozman; this legislation was part of our Working Families Tax Cut. Unlike previous farm bills, which didn\u2019t have nearly enough \"farm\" in them, the Working Families Tax Cut contained provisions to directly assist farmers and free up additional funding by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse.\nYet, these measures won\u2019t kick in until 2026. Furthermore, many farmers have already booked this year\u2019s crop, meaning they won\u2019t benefit from any recent increases in commodity pricing.\nFARMAGEDDON: TRUMP\u2019S TRADE WAR AND SHUTDOWN ARE CRUSHING THE HEARTLAND\nNash Farms is a fourth-generation dairy farm located in Tennessee.(Fox News Digital)\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: America\u2019s farmers need help \u2014 now.\nIn myhome state of Arkansas, for instance, our farmers are set to lose hundreds of dollars per acre on their soybean, corn, cotton and long-grain rice crops this year alone. The situation has gotten so bad that Arkansas cash crop receipts are now projected to fall by $617 million in 2025.\nAdding to these challenges for Arkansas farmers, the contrast between the steep cost of inputs (such as seed, fertilizer and diesel) and the commodity prices that farmers receive for their crops is at its highest level in 25 years. Put differently, input costs are too high and revenues are too low for many farmers to turn a profit, or at the very least, keep their businesses afloat. Unfortunately, the costs have caught up with too many Arkansas farmers; in the last year, among all southern region Chapter 12 bankruptcies (a classification specific to family farms and fishermen), one in four were filed in Arkansas.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAmerica\u2019s farmers also play a critical role in our consumer economy, which is essential to the security of our homeland. After all,food security is national security. Our adversaries would love nothing more than to see generations of farmers wiped out by economic hardship.\nIn recent months, soybean farmers have been unfairly targeted bycommunist China. This is particularly difficult for Arkansans, given that soybeans are grown in 41 of Arkansas\u2019 75 counties on thousands of farms across some 3.3 million acres in our state. While I welcome the announcement that communist China intends to purchase 12 million metric tons of soybeans this year \u2014 and 25 million metric tons every year for the next three years \u2014 we ought to keep in mind President Ronald Reagan\u2019s old Cold War approach: trust, but verify.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nI have spoken with PresidentDonald Trumpdirectly about the difficulties and hardships that farmers and ranchers in Arkansas and across America are facing.\u00a0Without a doubt, Trump keeps them at the top of his mind and close to his heart.

Pain with prices. Unsure about Trump administration policies. It adds up to high disapproval among the president\u2019s loyal constituencies.\nHere are six takeaways from the latest Fox News national survey.\n\u2014 Some 76% of voters view the economy negatively. That\u2019s worse than the 67% who felt that way in July and the 70% who said the same at the end of former President Biden\u2019s term.\n\u2014 Large numbers, overall and among Republicans, say their costs for groceries, utilities, healthcare and housing have gone up this year.\nFOX NEWS VOTER POLL \u2013 CHANGE CANDIDATE MAMDANI DEFEATS LEGACY POLITICAL FIGURES\n\u2014 Voters blame the president. About twice as many say President Donald Trump, rather than Biden, is responsible for the current economy. And three times as many say Trump\u2019s economic policies have hurt them (they said the same about Biden\u2019s last year). Plus, approval of how Trump is handling the economy hit a new low, and disapproval of his overall job performance hit record highs among core supporters.\n\u2014 After the government shutdown, the GOP and the Democratic Party have lower favorable ratings, and roughly 6 in 10 say the president and lawmakers on both sides don\u2019t care about people like them.\n\u2014 Voters think Republicans have a better plan for border security, immigration and crime, while Democrats are seen as better on affordability, wages, healthcare and climate.\n\u2014 Views are divided on Trump\u2019s peace deals making the world safer and the administration\u2019s strategy for dealing with alleged drug-traffickers.\nHere are the numbers behind those findings.\nTrump\u2019sjob performance drew career-high disapproval among men, White voters and those without a college degree.\nEighty-six percent of Republicans approve, down from 92% in March.\nAmong all voters, 41% approve of the job Trump is doing, while 58% disapprove. Only once have his ratings been lower and that was during his first term, 38-57% in October 2017. Two months ago, it was 46-54%.\nFor comparison,Biden\u2019smarks were a bit better at the same point in his presidency: 44% approved and 54% disapproved in November 2021.\nForty percent of voters rate their personal finances as excellent\/good, while 60% say only fair\/poor, which is about where things stood a year ago. Ratings are notably bad (roughly 70% negative), among non-college voters, Hispanics, Blacks, independents and those under age 45. For those with household income below $50,000, fully 79% rate their finances negatively.\nFOX NEWS VOTER POLL: NEW JERSEY GOVERNORSHIP REMAINS DEMOCRATIC WITH SHERRILL WIN\nWhen it comes to the national economy versus personal finances, evaluations are also negative. Most say conditions are only fair\/poor (76%), and fewer than one in five think inflation is completely\/mostly under control (18%).\nCompared to a year ago, voters say costs have increased for utilities (78%), healthcare (67%), housing (66%) and gasoline (54%). And 85% their grocery prices went up this year, including 60% who say costs increased \"a lot.\" Majorities of Republicans agree with majorities of Democrats and independents that costs have gone up on each of these items except gas.\nFOX NEWS VOTER POLL: CALIFORNIA VOTERS OK CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING PLAN\nAt the end of Biden\u2019s term, voters said by a wide 30-point margin that his economic policies had done more to hurt than help their families, driven by three-quarters of Republicans saying they had been harmed. The new survey shows almost identical results, as voters say by a 31-point margin that Trump\u2019s economic policies have hurt rather than helped them, driven by the three-quarters of Democrats saying they have been harmed. In December 2018, during his first term, only 21% overall said they had been hurt by Trump\u2019s policies, including just one-third of Democrats.\nBy a nearly 2-to-1 margin, voters say Trump is more responsible for the current economy than Biden (62% vs. 32%). Unsurprisingly, there\u2019s a large partisan gap, as Democrats are nearly 40 percentage points more likely than Republicans to blame Trump. Somewhat surprisingly though, 42% of Republicans blame him, while a 53% majority says Biden is responsible. Among independents, 62% say Trump and 29% Biden.\nA larger share believes the Republicans have a better plan for securing the border, dealing with illegal immigrants, reducing crime and reducing the federal budget deficit.\u00a0Democrats are preferred for addressing climate change, reducing the cost of healthcare, raising wages and making things more affordable. The parties are about equal on the issue of job creation.\nCongressional Democrats said the shutdown was about extending subsidies for Obamacare. The 2010 healthcare law remains popular, as 54% have a favorable opinion of it. Although much of that comes from nearly 9 in 10 Democrats viewing it positively.\u00a0Not only do voters think Democrats have a better plan for reducing healthcare costs, but Trump received his lowest approval on the issue of healthcare.\n\"The situation isn\u2019t complicated,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps run the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"People are struggling to afford necessities and blaming those in charge. What\u2019s interesting is watching Democrats gain politically from a problem they arguably caused \u2014 and that crushed them in 2024. But that\u2019s politics.\"\nWhile many families say thegovernment shutdowncaused them severe (10%) or moderate hardship (35%), more than half say it was not a hardship at all (54%).\nThe shutdown wasn\u2019t a political winner for anyone. Nearly two-thirds disapprove of how Trump (62%), congressional Republicans (63%) and congressional Democrats (64%) handled it.\nA record low 39% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party, down from 42% in July. Another 39% have positive views of the GOP, down from 44% this summer. For Trump, it\u2019s 40% positive, down from 43% in September and 50% in January.\nBut it\u2019s Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumerwhose marks have deteriorated the most. A record low 22% view him favorably versus 54% unfavorably, for a net rating of minus-32 points. His ratings were underwater by 16 points in January. Among Democrats, positive views of Schumer went from 51% in January to 38% today.\nThe overall marks for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took a smaller hit (from minus-2 to minus-10), as did Speaker of the House Mike Johnson\u2019s (from minus-9 to minus-15) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune\u2019s (from minus-10 to minus-12). Many are unable to evaluate Thune (54%), Jeffries (38%) and Johnson (31%).\nVoters also think their political leaders don\u2019t care about people like them, as roughly 6 in 10 say Democrats (59%) and Republicans (65%) in Congress and Trump (63%) don\u2019t care.\nTrump\u2019s job ratings onforeign policyare underwater: 43% approve, while 55% disapprove. Yet views are more evenly divided on whether his recent peace deals will make the world safer or less safe (37% apiece), with one quarter saying not much difference.\u00a0And 49% favor the U.S. military using deadly force against presumed drug trafficking boats departing from Venezuela, while 47% oppose those efforts.\nThe president receives his top marks on border security (53% approve). Nearly half approve of his handling of immigration (46%), while a new low approves on the economy (38%), and about one-third approve on tariffs (35%) and healthcare (34%).\nPoll-pourri\nThe electorate believes the different branches of government are failing to live up to their constitutional obligations. Two-thirds are concerned about Congress (64%) and the Supreme Court (63%) not doing the checks and balances that they should and are giving too much of their constitutional authority to the president. At the same time, about half (47%) are concerned the judicial branch is obstructing Trump\u2019s constitutional authority to carry out his agenda.\nCLICK HERE FORCROSSTABSANDTOPLINE\nConducted November 14-17, 2025, under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,005 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file.

If the city of Columbus, Nebraska, gets $2.5 million from the Home Partnership program, the city can go in and expand stormwater and sewer and maybe even pavement and streets,\" he explained.\n\"And suddenly, instead of being a $50,000 lot, it's a $20,000 lot. Instead of being a $300,000 home, you know, it's a $270,000 home because the cost of that was ultimately given to the city, and the city used it to build city infrastructure, not making the developer do that.\"\nRep.

{"title":"Biden\u2019s green energy fiasco, not Trump's reforms, is jacking up your electric bill","date":1763510400000,"body":"Interior Secretary Doug Burgum discusses 'delivering prosperity at home' and 'peace abroad' on 'America Reports.'\nThere\u2019s a battle to define a narrative about what\u2019s to blame for rising electricity prices. Some claim higher electricity prices are due to PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s \"one big beautiful bill,\" which curtailed subsidies for \"cheap\" wind and solar installations. Others blame AI\u2019s rapidly expanding appetite for electricity, while some blame inflation. None of these charges hold up under scrutiny.\nBut shifting blame, usually with the help of a complicit media, helps with the only thing that matters to most politicians: seizing political power.\nThis is readily seen in California Democrat Gov.Gavin Newsom\u2019s trip to Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, to rub elbows with the global elite at the U.N.\u2019s COP30 global climate conference on Nov. 11. Newsom, an all-but-declared candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 2028, slammed the Trump administration for not attending the confab, accusing the president of \"handing the future to China,\" presumably in the category of selling solar panels embedded with secret kill switches.\nNewsom went on to say that \"We\u2019re not turning backwards to the failed policies of the past \u2014California is fighting for a clean-energy future, even as\u00a0President Trump bends the knee to his Gulf-State patrons and takes a nap as the world burns.\" Newsom also claimed that California is now operating its grid on \"two-thirds clean energy,\" with California operating on 100% non-fossil-fuel energy for at least part of the day nine out of 10 days this year.\nNEWSOM CLAIMS TRUMP IS \u2018HANDING THE FUTURE TO CHINA\u2019 AT BRAZILIAN CLIMATE CONFAB THAT WH SKIPPED\nSolar power energy microgrid in California, as part of that state's green energy push.(Photo by SANDY HUFFAKER\/AFP via Getty Images)\nBut California now has thenation\u2019s second-highest electricity prices, only behind Hawaii, with the Golden State\u2019s electricity prices rising the most of any state since 2010: 127%, according to a new report from Jonathan A. Lesser, Ph.D., a senior fellow with the National Center for Energy Analytics.\nThe truth that Newsom doesn\u2019t want Californians \u2014 or Democratic primary voters \u2014 to know is that \"green\" energy is expensive energy. That\u2019s because, \"60% of the time, (wind and solar) works every time\" to borrow from the much-memed comedy \"Anchorman.\" And, it\u2019s very costly to make sure the power is on when wind and solar aren\u2019t producing.\nThis, Lesser notes, is one of the main culprits in rising electricity costs.\nLIZ PEEK: TRUMP WHITE HOUSE FIRED UP ABOUT KING COAL\u2019S RETURN TO POWER\nThe Biden-Harris administration\u2019sreckless push for subsidized wind and solar \u2014and California\u2019s before that and since \u2014 has destabilized our grid and forced consumers to foot the bill for fortifying unreliable \"green\" energy with reliable gas power and expensive batteries \u2014 the latter of limited utility.\nFrom the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2025, average residential electricity rates across the U.S. surged by about 63%, according to\u00a0Energy Information Administration (EIA)\u00a0data. But the pain isn\u2019t evenly distributed.States like Massachusettsand California not only endured the steepest hikes, but now boast two of the nation's highest rates \u2014 over 30 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases.\nCritics peddle all sorts of excuses for these increases. One target is data centers, those power-hungry hubs fueling AI and cloud computing. Sure, they consume a lot of power \u2014 Virginia, a data center hotspot, has seen demand rise. But Virginia\u2019s rates? Below-average increases and still under the national norm. If data centers are the villain, why isn\u2019t the Old Dominion suffering like California?\nTRUMP'S UN SPEECH REVEALS INCONVENIENT TRUTH OF MASSIVE GREEN ENERGY COSTS\nA recent International Renewable Energy Agency report touts falling costs for renewables. But as Lesser\u2019s analysis shows, that\u2019s a half-truth at best. Subsidies like the federal production tax credit \u2014 now $27.50 per megawatt-hour \u2014 let wind and solar operators undercut the market with negative bids, distorting wholesale prices and squeezing out reliable baseload plants \u2014 which end up not being built.\nHere\u2019s the missing link the green advocates ignore: the shift in our generating mix. Between 2010 and 2024, U.S. electricity capacity grew 16% to 1,325 gigawatts, outpacing a mere 5% rise in retail sales. Sounds good, right? Wrong. Dispatchable sources \u2014 coal, gas and nuclear, which can ramp up on demand \u2014 plummeted by 80 gigawatts. Intermittent wind and solar ballooned seven-fold, to 278 gigawatts.\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom traveled to Brazil for the COP30 World Climate Conference, touting his state's energy policies while the Trump administration skipped the event.(Larissa Schwedes\/picture alliance via Getty Images)\nThis trend accelerated in 2025: More than 1,900 megawatts of fossil fuel retired by July, with another 12,600 megawatts slated for shutdown by year\u2019s end and into 2026. What's replacing them? Moresubsidized wind, solar, and pricey batteries.\nTRUMP'S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS\nIt\u2019s policy malpractice. States like New Jersey and New York forcedpremature closures of reliable power plantssuch as Oyster Creek nuclear in 2018 and Indian Point in 2021, which powered a quarter of New York City\u2019s needs.\nBiden-era EPA rules, now being rolled back under Trump, would have shuttered most coal plants by 2032. Mandates for cars to have \"zero-emissions\" by 2035 in places like California ignore reality. Where will they get the electricity? Wind and solar can\u2019t provide inertia or reactive power, essential for grid stability.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe fallout?

Not because they are wrong about AI's risks, but because they have failed to offer Americans a vision for the economic transformation ahead. While they focus on managing problems, others are defining what comes next. One side is talking about building the future, the other about constraining it.\nIn November, at Nvidia's GTC conference in Washington, hundreds of technologists and business leaders celebrated a great American success story: Jensen Huang and the company he co-founded. \u00a0The speakers praised PresidentDonald Trumpfor his administration's approach to AI. Many in the audience saw an administration that's for removing barriers, enabling scale and improving American competitiveness.\nThis should be a wake-up call for Democrats, who have failed to seize the opportunity so far to speak not only to AI's risks, but to its potential for broad economic transformation.Democrats haveasked plenty of questions about AI\u2019s safety, its biases and its effect on the job market.\nBut so far, Democrats have treated these as separate problems to manage rather than as pieces of a larger question: how do we shape this transformation so it creates opportunity for everyone, not just profits for a few? That's the conversation Americans deserve.\nTHE NEW ARMS RACE IS FOR COMPUTE \u2014 AND AMERICA CAN\u2019T AFFORD TO FALL BEHIND\nD.C. Democrats need to reclaim the issue of AI from Republicans.(iStock)\nTheelite consensus in Washingtonfocuses on one goal: optimize America's AI capabilities as a whole. A recent Foreign Affairs\u00a0essay\u00a0by former Biden administration officials captures the \"grand bargain\" between government and industry: more infrastructure and capacity for big companies. Workers, communities and startups beyond the frontier are afterthoughts.\u00a0Build first, assume prosperity trickles down later. It's a familiar strategy that hasn't delivered before.\u00a0Republicans mostly embrace this framework as well, but Republican populists smartly recognize its shortcomings.\nWhat this means going forward: Large companies positioned to capture trillions. Worker displacement a problem to solve later. Communities provide land, energy, and water without guarantees they'll share in prosperity. The Biden administration's 2023 executive order was comprehensive on safety testing but said little about prosperity, workers or communities.\nPast waves of automation left communities hollowed out and workers without pathways forward. Innovation rarely distributes opportunity without deliberate efforts to strengthen workers, communities and local economies.\nRecent polling in swing states shows AI sentiment declining as workers connect the technology to job insecurity. We all lose. Not to China, but to ourselves. The skepticism crosses ideological lines. On the far right, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon warned earlier this year that entry-level jobs will be destroyed. On the far left, Democratic Socialists see AI as another vehicle for corporate power. Both responses cede the possibility that AI could distribute opportunity rather than concentrate wealth.\nTRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA\nAn alternative vision would optimize for the flourishing of American Davids: our workers, families and innovative startups.\u00a0Large companies' long-term success depends on this foundation too. It's not about slowing down. The capital is moving fast regardless. The question is whether we structure that rapid deployment to create broadly shared prosperity or concentrated extraction. Aimless speed creates the political backlash that actually threatens progress. Speed with a plan creates sustainable advancement.\nWe've done this before.

This moment calls for a national project worthy of American ingenuity.\nDemocrats have a long history with this thinking. Rural electrification and railroad policy ensured broad access. Today, Arizona Democratic Sen.Mark Kelly's \"AI for America\" proposal represents the kind of bigger vision we should debate.\nDemocrats have an opportunity now to pursue an alternative path and offer our country a national project that centers AI advances as the critical innovation for a prosperous, healthy, and safe future for all Americans.\nAimless speed creates the political backlash that actually threatens progress.

Gen Z has literally stuck a fork intocasual diningand picked up grocery bags instead.\nChipotle\u2019s CEO Scott Boatwright recently said younger diners, especially those between 25 and 35, are \"facing several headwinds\" and simply aren\u2019t eating out as often. The translation: Generation Z is going broke and they know it. The $15 burrito bowl has become a symbol of a generation that\u2019s tightening its belt as the mounting pressure of grocery prices, student loan repayments, and spiraling credit card debt run out of control.\nFast casual dining out was once considered an affordable convenience and has now become a small luxury. Boatwright said bluntly that Chipotle isn\u2019t losing younger customers to competitors; it\u2019s losing them to grocery stores and food at home. Think about that. The same people who fueled the fast-casual boom are now saying, \"I\u2019ll just cook instead.\"\n'NOBODY'S SPENDING $17 ON AN EGG SANDWICH': RESTAURANT OWNERS SAY INFLATION FORCING TOUGH MENU CHOICES\nAt CAVA, CEO Brett Schulman sees the same pattern. He admits younger guests are \"making more deliberate choices\" about spending. Even though CAVA bowls average $11 to $13 most of the time, that still feels like a splurge. Your bank account balance is less than 30 days away from hitting zero. Schulman calls today\u2019s economy a \"fog\" and in that fog,fast casual restauranttraffic is disappearing.\nIn 2025, the same people who once fueled the fast-casual boom are now deciding to cook at home instead.(iStock)\nThis generation isn\u2019t lazy or spoiled.

Auto loans now stretch seven or even eight years for many younger buyers. And while rent and grocery prices soar, real wage growth has stalled.\nThis is what \"voting with your wallet\" looks like in 2025. We just saw this with the mayoral election in New York City. And you will see this become the number one issue in the 2026 midterms.\nFREE MEAL IS MOTIVATING NEARLY 1 IN 3 SINGLES TO SAY 'YES' TO DATE, NEW REPORT FINDS\nIn the past,younger consumers led the charge in dining trendsby paying more for organic, sustainable or fast-casual meals that felt upscale but affordable. Now those same consumers are financially maxed out. Even though many are making decent incomes, the real after-tax wages simply aren\u2019t keeping up with thedebt and overall inflation.\nThis isn\u2019t just about burrito bowls or Mediterranean grain bowls. It\u2019s a signal that consumer behavior is changing across the country and this trend is going to continue given the larger picture of sustainable housing affordability. Younger Americans are voting with their wallets, and they\u2019re saying: we\u2019re done paying $20 for lunch.\nGen Z isn\u2019t anti-burrito. They\u2019re giving up dining out, and they're reacting to a generation's broken financial equation. With inflation eating away at their paychecks and debt stacking up, all types of small luxuries are getting cut.(iStock)\nFast casual dining chains built their success on speed, quality, and a perceived value gap between fast-food and full-service restaurants. But that middle ground is now under siege and people are returning to dollar-value menus at fast-food restaurants anddiscount grocery stores like Aldi.\nAMERICA'S PIZZA BOOM GOES COLD AS DELIVERY APPS TAKE BIGGER SLICE OF THE PIE\nCurrently,value focused chains like McDonald\u2019s, Chili\u2019s, and Domino\u2019sare gaining share. When inflation bites, people trade down. They still want convenience without paying the premium price tag. The same $12-to-$15 spent on a fully loaded bowl can cover two homemade dinners or a week\u2019s worth of frozen meals.\nFor anyonerunning or buying a restaurant, your customer base is shifting. The 25- to-35-year-old demographic, once the lifeblood of fast-casual dining, is disappearing faster than guacamole on a Friday night.\n(For anyone running or buying a restaurant, your customer base is shifting. The 25- to-35-year-old demographic, once the lifeblood of fast-casual dining, is disappearing faster than guacamole on a Friday night.)\nIf your concept relies heavily on younger diners, it\u2019s time to rethink pricing, promotions and loyalty. People still love good food, but they\u2019re searching for value. Boatwright has already said Chipotle won\u2019t chase customers by cutting prices. That\u2019s admirable, but it\u2019s risky and stocks like CAVA and Chipotle could feel significant pain. Holding the line on price when consumers feel squeezed could hurt traffic much more than you think.\nGEN Z DRINKERS LEAVE BARTENDERS FRUSTRATED WITH SHRINKING TIPS AS 'TERRIBLE' TREND EMERGES\nFrom a valuation standpoint, buyers are looking harder at guest demographics, frequency trends and economic resilience. A restaurant that relies on young professionals may see its valuation dip unless it can prove stability in a downturn.\nGen Z isn\u2019t anti-burrito. They\u2019ve woken up to realize that it\u2019s not worth the mental and financial stress clawing their way out of debt.

You can't have accountability without visibility. Taxpayers need a much clearer picture of the federal workforce than they have today.\"\nU.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa,has been working with Open The Books to fight for greater transparency. In a letter sent in September to Scott Kupor, the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Ernst said she had identified \"numerous examples\" of full-time federal employees earning two salaries while moonlighting for other agencies or government contractors, something typically prohibited under the law. Ernst pointed out that this was being done without the approval or knowledge of these workers' managers.\nFAR-LEFT FIREBRAND SPENDS EYE-POPPING AMOUNT OF CAMPAIGN CASH ON LUXURY HOTELS, \u2018TOP-TIER\u2019 LIMO SERVICES\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, (center) speaks on Capitol Hill alongside senators Shelley Moore Capito, R-WVa.; Steve Daines, R-Mont; and John Thune, R-S.D.(Reuters)\n\"From 2021 to 2024, a Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) employee held multiple other full-time government contractor jobs, frequentlybilling taxpayersfor more than 24 hours of work in a single day,\" Ernst chronicled in her letter. \"In addition to HUD, she was paid by AmeriCorps and the National Institutes of Health. Since she teleworked in all three positions, she was able to hide her overlapping jobs and get away with billing taxpayers $225,866 for hours she never worked. She claimed she worked 26 hours on 13 of the 21 workdays in a single month.\"\nErnst also described a second example of a human resources official at the Peace Corps who was caught falsifying time cards submitted to different agencies, which led to the employee double-billing taxpayers for tens of thousands of dollars. She laid out several other examples in the letter as well.\n\"Until recently, outside of death and taxes, the expanding Washington bureaucracy was one of the few certainties in life,\" said Ernst. \"I am proud to have partnered with the Trump administration and DOGE to successfully downsize the bloated bureaucracy, but there is much more work to be done to make Washington more efficient.\"\nOne can \"look no further\" than the \"failed Schumer shutdown,\" Ernst said, pointing out that taxpayers will be on the hook for more than $12 billion in back pay for 750,000 non-essential federal employees who did not work for a month and a half.\nThe \u00a0U.S. capitol building in Washington, D.C.(Win McNamee\/Getty Images)\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn October, Ernst introduced the Non-Essential Workers Transparency Act, aimed at providing the public with an exact accounting of how much back pay the government will be required to fork over in the case of a shutdown.\nThe bill would require executive agencies to submit detailed reports to Congress within 30 days of a lapse in appropriations that must include the total number of employees and contractors employed by the agency at the time of the shutdown, the total salaries paid by the agency during the prior fiscal year, the number of furloughed during the lapse and their annual pay, the number of employees not furloughed and the sum of their pay and a requirement that all this information be posted publicly on the agencies' websites.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/big-paychecks-bigger-problems-how-bloated-bureaucracy-exposes-congress-funding-failure","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":0,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":0,"topic_crypto":0}

PresidentDonald Trumpis correct to say that the dream is slipping out of reach for too many families. Home prices have skyrocketed, mortgage rates have doubled since 2021, and young Americans are\u00a0finding\u00a0it more challenging than ever to buy a home and put down roots.\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that the administration is\u00a0exploring\u00a0new ways to \"make housing affordable again.\" One of those ideas, a50-year\u00a0fixed-rate mortgage, promises smaller monthly payments by stretching out the life of the loan.\nBut the problem isn\u2019t the rates or lengths of\u00a0mortgages; it\u2019s the cost of the house.\nPresident Donald Trump is correct to say that the American dream of homeownership is slipping out of reach for too many families.(AP Photo\/Mark Schiefelbein)\nExtending loan terms just\u00a0spreads\u00a0the pain over more years. Longer\u00a0mortgages\u00a0might lower the monthly bill, but they multiply the total debt. On a $400,000 loan at 6% interest, a\u00a050-year\u00a0mortgage means paying roughly $1.26 million over the life of the loan, more than triple the original amount. After 20 years, you\u2019d still owe almost $350,000.\nHOUSING COSTS ARE CRUSHING FAMILIES \u2013 HERE\u2019S THE WAY OUT\nThe real challenge is that the government has made ittoo expensive to buildand buy homes in the first place. Washington and local governments pile on costs at every step through\u00a0tariffs, taxes, fees and endless red tape. Builders can\u2019t build affordably when they\u2019re forced to navigate an obstacle course of regulation and delay.\nEven Bill Pulte, President Trump\u2019s housing chief and a longtime homebuilder himself, has\u00a0acknowledged\u00a0how high interest rates and housing costs are \"really hurting people.\" He\u2019s right about the pain families are feeling, but the solution is lower costs. As any economist can tell you, affordability begins with more supply, not more subsidies.\nMackenzie Bishop, a homebuilder with\u00a0Abrazos Homes\u00a0in Albuquerque,\u00a0recently laid out\u00a0the math in blunt terms.Local taxes and feesadd more than $40,000 to the cost of every new home before a single nail is hammered. Add property tax increases of 50 to 70% on multifamily projects, and new construction grinds to a halt. Multiply that across the country, and it\u2019s no wonder builders can\u2019t keep up with demand or why the homes that do get built are\u00a0out of reach\u00a0for working families.\nWHY YOUR PARENTS COULD AFFORD A HOUSE ON ONE SALARY \u2013 BUT YOU CAN\u2019T ON TWO\nIt\u2019s the\u00a0same story nationwide. Tariffs have\u00a0raised the prices\u00a0of building materials like lumber, steel and concrete. Meanwhile,\u00a0permitting\u00a0and environmental reviews can delay projects for years, driving up financing costs and draining the incentive to build at all.\nThese are the hidden taxes that keepAmerica\u2019s housing supplyartificially scarce, and that scarcity \u2013 not the length of the mortgage \u2013 is what drives prices higher.\nEven as\u00a0inflation\u00a0has cooled from its peak, prices are\u00a0still rising\u00a0about 3% a year. \"Sticky\" costs like rent, insurance and shelter remain stubbornly high. That means families\u2019 paychecks are\u00a0stretched thin\u00a0before they even start saving for a down payment. The Federal Reserve may eventually cut interest rates, but unless we fix the underlying supply problem, housing will remain unaffordable no matter the loan term.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe good news is that conservatives already know how to fix this. Instead of inventing new forms of debt, we can make it easier and\u00a0cheaper to build\u00a0the homes Americans need. That means streamlining permitting andcutting the bureaucracythat slows construction, eliminating tariffs that drive up the price of materials, and expanding legal immigration to rebuild the skilled trades workforce that keeps the housing market moving.\nIt also means reforming zoning laws that allow a handful of activists to block entire neighborhoods and phasing out\u00a0federal subsidies\u00a0that inflate prices by distorting credit markets. Together, these reforms would tackle the real causes of\u00a0high housing costs: scarcity, inefficiency and government overreach.\nDo those things, and the market will do what it does best: deliver abundance, innovation and opportunity.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe goal of homeownership is worth fighting for. It strengthens families, builds communities and creates generational wealth. But we can\u2019t borrow our way to prosperity. The answer to high housing costs isn\u2019t a longer mortgage; it\u2019s a lighter burden.\nPresident Trump\u2019s instinct to put working families first is right on target. The best way tomake housing affordable againis to unleash America\u2019s builders, entrepreneurs and workers, not to create a new kind of debt. Let builders build. Let markets work.

They framed their inquiries at times around two legal principles, known as the major questions and non-delegation doctrines, and scrutinized the text of the emergency law Trump invoked to enact the tariffs.\nJustice Clarence Thomas set the stage for the nearly three-hour arguments. In the first question of the day, Thomas, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, asked Sauer to \"spend a few minutes on why exactly the major questions doctrine doesn't apply to the president in this case.\"\nBARRETT AND SOTOMAYOR TAG-TEAM TRUMP LAWYER ON TARIFF POWERS\nSupreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor, left, and Clarence Thomas pose for their official portrait inside the court\u2019s East Conference Room on Oct. 7, 2022, in Washington, D.C.(Alex Wong\/Getty Images)\nUnder the principle, courts look to make sure the executive branch has not used a vaguely written law to carry out an act of major national significance, like worldwide tariffs.\nSauer responded that the tariffs case, which involved foreign trade deals, was a \"particularly poor fit\" to apply the major questions doctrine because courts should give broader power to the president on foreign policy matters.\nBrent\u00a0Skorup, a legal fellow at the CATO Institute, which has sided against Trump in the case, told Fox News Digital he has seen two trends emerge from the Supreme Court. One is a long-term trend where the high court is highly deferential to the president on overseas matters, but the other, he said, was a more recent use of the major questions doctrine.\nCourts have increasingly used the doctrine to demand clear statutory permission for blockbuster policies, striking down agency actions in West Virginia v. EPA andBiden v. Nebraska. Several justices asked whether that same rule applies when the president, rather than an agency, claims sweeping tariff power under the statute Trump used, which never mentions the word \"tariffs.\"\n\"It's not clear which trend will play out,\" Skorup said. \"My hunch is that most, and this was confirmed at oral arguments, most justices are probably leaning towards favoring the importers and these more recent doctrinal trends will prevail.\" He added he was encouraged by Chief Justice Roberts pressing Sauer about the matter.\n\"He seemed to think there's a major questions problem here,\" Skorup said.\nTRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER'\nA demonstrator holds a sign outside the Supreme Court as justices hear arguments on President Trump\u2019s global tariff powers on Nov. 5, 2025.(Bill Clark\/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\nTrump has beenon a rampage this week, emphasizing the perceived stakes of the case, a sign that he could be bracing for an unfavorable outcome.\nTrump claimed that if the tariffs are deemed illegal, the potential refund process could exceed $3 trillion. He said the justices were given \"wrong numbers\" about repayment costs.\n\"It would not be possible to ever make up for that kind of \u2018drubbing,\u2019\" Trump wrote on social media. \"That would truly become an insurmountable National Security Event, and devastating to the future of our Country \u2013 Possibly non-sustainable!\"\nTrump used the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to sidestep Congress' role in approving taxes and tariffs, saying the opioid epidemic and trade deficit amounted to a national emergency and justified a host of tariffs on imports from major trading partners from China and India to Canada and Mexico. Trump has touted the billions in revenue collected by the government and said it will be used to pay $2,000 to lower-income families and pay off some of the national debt.\nTRUMP\u2019S OWN SCOTUS PICKS COULD WIND UP HURTING HIM ON TARIFFS\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett and President Donald Trump are shown in a split image as the Supreme Court weighs Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers for worldwide tariffs.(Getty Images)\nBut the justices repeatedly questioned how Trump could justify bypassingCongress, especially when IEEPA was not clear on the matter. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Sonia Sotomayor, Trump and Obama appointees, respectively, grilled Sauer about how IEEPA did not spell out that the president could unilaterally enact tariffs, even if it did give the president the power to \"regulate imports.\"\nThe Supreme Court could also factor the non-delegation doctrine into its finding, either in an avoidant or direct way. The key question is, even if IEEPA could be read to allow tariffs, would that reading hand the president Congress\u2019s core tariff authority without a limiting principle?\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, seemed particularly interested in the issue, asking Sauer if Congress could \"delegate to the president the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations as he sees fit.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIf the Supreme Court were to take the avoidant route, according to Ilan Wurman, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, it could interpret IEEPA narrowly to avoid a possible finding that Congress improperly passed off its tariff authority to the president. Wurman told Fox News Digital that would be easier than directly concluding that Congress gave up its constitutional power to another branch of government.\nBut, Wurman said, \"on the other hand, every century or so the Supreme Court should strike something down under the non-delegation doctrine.

They were furious that he gave in to the GOP and didn\u2019t win any concessions for allowing the government to continue to function.\nIT\u2019S NOT JUST THE ECONOMY \u2014 THIS IS HOW DEMOCRATS BEAT THE GOP ACROSS THE COUNTRY\nNever mind that polls always show that most Americans want our two political parties to work together to resolve the nation\u2019s problems.

Kathy Hochul is facing a primary challenge from her own leftist lieutenant governor.\nTHE GOP'S 2026 CHALLENGE \u2014 HOLDING TRUMP'S BASE WHEN HE'S NOT ON THE BALLOT\nMeanwhile, as Democrats eat their own, Americans are discovering the truth about Obamacare.Schumer and his Senate colleagueswere fighting to prolong the enhanced subsidies established under President Joe Biden that made ACA health insurance premiums more affordable. Those subsidies were meant to expire at the end of this year. However, it turns out that premium costs without those subsidies would skyrocket, putting insurance out of reach for millions of families.\nThe subsidies under consideration were included in the American Rescue Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, both of which passed with zero Republican votes. Thus, having Democrats blame the GOP for the expiration of those payments is ridiculous.\nThe truth is that Obamacare, which covers only 7% of Americans and was also passed only with Democratic votes, is a failed program. It was meant to bring the cost of health insurance down, but never did. It was set up so that millions of young, healthy Americans would be forced to sign up as a result of the \"individual mandate,\" a tax penalty which compelled people to have health insurance whether they wanted it or not. The healthcare costs of that young cohort were expected to be low, offsetting the higher expenses of older and sicker Americans.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ended the unpopular individual mandate, thus overturning the underlying method of spreading the cost of insurance over a larger pool of people. As a result, Obamacare increasingly covered individuals with higher healthcare costs, and premiums rose.\nObamacare premiums in general will rise about 30% for next year; with the expiration of the enhanced subsidies, some people are going to be hit with a premium hike of 50% or more.\nDemocrats are blaming the GOP for creating a \"healthcare crisis,\" but that is dishonest. They voted for Obamacare, and they hid its true costs for years by offering ever more generous subsidies. And, they voted to allow those subsidies to expire. The cost of continuing those payments would be some $350 billion over 10 years, not including interest payments; the Trump administration wants to find a better path forward.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nFew Republicans want to tackle overhauling Obamacare, or our convoluted healthcare system, as both have proven in the past to be \"third-rail\" political issues.

Democrats understood that and they won. Big. Republicans, meanwhile, are facing challenges that look strikingly similar to those that cost Democrats so dearly just two years ago.\nTax cuts for the rich vs. affordability for all\nDemocrats didn\u2019t win because they suddenly became masterful campaigners, or because their candidates were flawless. They won because they focused on what\u2019s keeping Americans up at night\u2014 rising prices, shrinking paychecks and the anxiety that the American Dream is slipping further away. They promised to cap drug prices, rein in healthcare costs and make life a little less punishing for the middle class.\nAnd crucially, Democratsran unapologeticallyon taxing the rich \u2014 a message that resonated far beyond their base. For years, Republicans have viewed calls to raise taxes on the wealthy as an attack on success, a threat to the American ethos of upward mobility. But for many Americans, and for Democrats this cycle, it was about fairness. If you\u2019re rich, you can afford to pay more. After all, the rich aren\u2019t struggling \u2014 everyone else is. That sense of basic justice, not class warfare, is what made the message so powerful and popular.\nMARK PENN: DEMOCRATS WIN THE MOMENT, BUT LEFT-WING TILT THREATENS THEIR FUTURE\nRepublicans, by contrast, leaned onfamiliar themes: tax cuts, deregulation and the promise that economic growth would lift all boats. But, this time, voters seemed to want something more immediate and tangible. In poll after poll, affordability dwarfed every other concern. Democrats beat Republicans by eight points on who could best handle the cost of living. When one party is talking about your grocery bill and the other is defending capital gains, the outcome isn\u2019t a mystery.\nNot just \"The Economy, Stupid\" \u2014 it\u2019s affordability\nThere\u2019s a twist inthis year\u2019s resultsthat\u2019s easy to miss, but crucial to understand: while Republicans still hold an edge when voters are asked who\u2019s better for \"the economy\" in general, Democrats won on the issue that mattered most \u2014 affordability.\nPolls show that Americans continue to trust Republicans more on broad economic stewardship. But, when it comes to the day-to-day reality of paying for groceries, rent, healthcare and gas, Democrats pulled ahead. In a recent Reuters\/Ipsos poll, cost-of-living concerns topped the list of voter priorities, and Democrats were favored on the specific question of who can make life more affordable.\nThis isn\u2019t just about GDP or stock market numbers. It\u2019s about the price of eggs, the cost of a doctor\u2019s visit and whether families feel they can get ahead. Voters weren\u2019t just asking, \"Who can grow the economy?\" They were asking, \"Who can make my paycheck go further?\"\nThe lesson: It\u2019s not just \"the economy, stupid.\" It\u2019s that things cost too much, and most people feel like they\u2019re running in place. Theparty that understands\u2014 and addresses \u2014 that reality is the one that wins.\nThe GOP\u2019s Familiar Challenge\nAfter the election, President Trump sat down with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier and admitted, \"We learned a lot.\" But in the same breath, he suggested that things aren\u2019t so bad after all. \"The country is doing very well,\" he said, pointing to falling energy prices and predicting a return to $2 gasoline. The message was: we\u2019ve done this before, and we can do it again.\nYet, for many voters, the reassurance didn\u2019t quite land. The gap between political optimism and everyday reality was hard to ignore. While Republicans highlighted their record and warned about the dangers of socialism, those arguments were sometimes overshadowed by internal divisions \u2014 most notably, a rising tide of antisemitism that\u2019s fracturing the party and distracting from the issues that matter most.\nIf this all feels familiar, it should.\n2024 in reverse\nThis is 2024 in reverse. Back then, Democrats tried to reassure voters that the economy wasn\u2019t as bad as it felt, even as Americans struggled with rising costs. The left was busy debating \"wokeism,\" alienating moderates and driving away the very voters it needed most.\nNow, it\u2019s the GOP\u2019s turn to face a similar crossroads: emphasizing past achievements and ideological battles, while voters are looking for immediate relief. Democrats, having learned from their own missteps, are laser-focused on affordability \u2014 and it\u2019s paying off.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe cycle continues\nHere\u2019s the lesson, as old as politics itself: Ignore the kitchen table, and you lose the house. When a party becomes more invested in defending its own narrative than in addressing real pain, it risks losing trust \u2014 and elections.\nIf Republicans want to avoid thefate that befell Democrats, they may need to shift from reassurance to action. Voters want to know not just that things can get better, but how \u2014 and when. Because here\u2019s the twist: the party that owns affordability owns the future.\nThe closing thought\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nSo, as the dust settles, ask yourself: When was the last time a voter changed their mind because a politician told them their problems weren\u2019t real? When was the last time a party won by focusing on yesterday\u2019s debates instead of today\u2019s bills?\nThe answer is rarely, if ever. And if that feels like a revelation, maybe it\u2019s time for both parties to stop telling Americans what to think \u2014 and start listening to what they\u2019re saying.\nLee Hartley Carter is president of Maslansky + Partners, a language strategist, researcher and author of \"Persuasion: Convincing Others When Facts Don't Seem to Matter\" (TarcherPerigee, September 3, 2019).\u00a0Follow her on X on@lh_carter.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/its-not-just-economy-how-democrats-beat-gop-across-country","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":1,"topic_jobs":0,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s own SCOTUS picks could wind up hurting him on tariffs","date":1762560000000,"body":"Legal fellow Brent Skorup says the president\u2019s use of emergency tariffs goes beyond what IEEPA allows in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case centered on PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s use of an emergency law to enact his sweeping \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, and even Trump-appointed justices appeared skeptical of the administration\u2019s arguments.\nSeveral questions from conservative justices, particularly Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, suggested uncertainty about allowing Trump to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact his steep 10% tariffs on most imports. A ruling against the administration would deliver a major blow to Trump's signature economic policy.\nThe IEEPA law gives the president broad economic powers in the event of a national emergency tied to foreign threats, and Trump declared the trade deficit such an emergency to impose tariffs via executive order earlier this year. But the law does not mention the word \"tariffs\" or \"taxes\" \u2014 a major sticking point in both this week\u2019s oral arguments and the lower court\u2019s earlier review of the case.\nMost of the justices\u2019 questions focused on a single phrase in the law \u2014 the power to \"regulate importation\" during a national emergency \u2014 and whether that phrase grants Trump the authority he claims. Several justices seemed wary of a reading that could hand Congress\u2019 Article I power over revenue and taxation to the executive branch.\nSUPREME COURT TO WEIGH TRUMP TARIFF POWERS IN BLOCKBUSTER CASE\nMembers of the Supreme Court sit for a group photo following the recent addition of Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, at the Supreme Court building on Capitol Hill on Friday, Oct 7, 2022, in Washington, D.C.(Jabin Botsford\/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\nThis includedTrump\u2019s appointees, who appeared to struggle with separation-of-powers issues that could vastly expand presidential authority \u2014 not only for Trump but for his successors as well.\nBarrett, in particular, pressed U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer on this, asking: \"Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase \u2014 together with \u2018regulate importation\u2019 \u2014 has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?\"\nGorsuch later asked Sauer about his \"theory of the Constitution\" and \"major questions doctrine,\" indicating concern about separation-of-powers issues and granting too much power to the executive.\nTRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER'\nProtester Nadine Seiler, 60 (left), and plaintiff Victor Schwartz (right) in front of the Supreme Court building ahead of oral arguments regarding President Trump's legal authority to impose most of his sweeping tariffs in Washington, D.C., Wed. Nov. 5, 2025.(Maxine Wallace\/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\"What would prohibit Congress from abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce or declare war to the president?\" Gorsuch asked Sauer.\nSauer repeatedly argued that a \"regulatory tariff\" is not a tax and that the power to raise revenue was \"only incidental,\" even asthe White House has celebratedthat Trump's tariff revenues exceeded $100 billion this year.\nChallengers, including private entities and Democratic-led states, argue that Congress must clearly state when it wants presidents to have the authority to implement tariffs. In court filings, they pointed to laws such as Section 232 (national security trade measures) and Section 301 (retaliation for unfair trade) as times when Congress expressly gave tariff powers to the president. By contrast, IEEPA has been used for embargoes, asset freezes and licensing but never across-the-board tariffs. The last time the Court permitted a delegation of tariff powers to the president, in Algonquin SNG v. FEA (1976), it relied on Section 232 because Congress put that authority plainly in the statute. Challengers say there is no comparable language in IEEPA.\nThe liberal justices on the Court signaled that without clear words from Congress, IEEPA cannot provide Trump with tariff authority. After a previous Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024), courts no longer give federal agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting vague laws. And under the \"major questions\" doctrine referred to by Gorsuch and other justices, large, economy-wide actions like Trump's tariffs need a plain, specific grant from Congress.\nJONATHAN TURLEY: SUPREME COURT RULING ON TRUMP TARIFFS COMES DOWN TO A NUMBERS GAME\nScott Bessent, U.S. Treasury Secretary, speaks to reporters outside the White House in Washington, D.C., on Wed, Nov. 5, 2025.(Eric Lee\/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nCourt watchers and legal experts said after arguments that a Trump administration win could be more difficult than expected, though each cautioned it is hard to draw conclusions from roughly two hours of oral arguments \u2014 a fraction of the total time justices spend reviewing a case.\nJonathan Turley, a law professor and Fox News contributor, said in ablog postthat the justices \"were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers.\"\n\"However, there is a real chance of a fractured decision that could still produce an effective win for the administration,\" Turley added.\nSUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY\nJack Goldsmith, a former assistant attorney general in theGeorge W.

The White House previously told Fox News Digital that the fee works to prevent \"companies from spamming the system and driving down wages\" with cheap foreign labor, while simultaneously promoting \"American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers\" to the U.S.\nThe Department of Labor could not provide details on the specifics of the 175 current investigations, which account for over $15 million in calculated back wages to workers, but reported to Fox Digital that it has uncovered a bounty of concerns.\nThe investigations have uncovered that some foreign workers with advanced degrees are paid far less than what's promoted in a job description, which the DOL said drives down wages for visa-holders and American workers alike, while also forcing American employees with the same qualification to accept lower wages in order to stay competitive.\nOther investigations found that employers did not even notify U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services when an H-1B visa holder was terminated, or found significant lag times between a termination and an employer notifying the agency that oversees the U.S.'s immigration system.\nWALMART HALTS HIRING WORKERS WHO NEED H-1B VISAS AFTER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IMPOSES NEW FEE\nLori Chavez-DeRemer, U.S. Secretary of Labor.(Chip Somodevilla\/Getty Images)\nAt the heart of other investigations, Fox News Digital learned, are documents filed by employers with the DOL in order to employ H-1B holders, as well as other visa programs, called Labor Condition Applications (LCA). Employers are required to give notice to American workers before hiring H-IB workers when filing an LCA, which is part of a larger effort to ensure American workers get first dibs on jobs, as well as accurately describe the job an employee will work and detailing the employee's wage.\nInvestigators found that work sites listed on the LCA documents did not exist, or that workers were unaware of the jobs they were supposedly assigned to perform as laid out in the applications. Other investigations found that employees were paid less than what was detailed in an LCA, or that employers were sloppily copying and pasting job notices for American workers that had little connection to the job described in the LCA.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Sept. 19, 2025.(Aaron Schwartz\/CNP\/Bloomberg\/Getty Images)\nOther investigations found some employees took part in \"benching,\" which is when H-1B visa holders are not paid anything when they are in-between active work projects, Fox Digital found.\nMany tech companies have embraced the H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, but critics of the program say H-1B holders are often chosen over U.S. citizens for jobs. One of the reasons for this is that foreign workers are tied to their respective employers via the H-1B visa \u2014 as a company is required to sponsor the visa \u2014 and therefore quitting the job could ultimately see foreign workers losing their visa and their ability to legally remain in the country.\nJustin Vianello, CEO of Skillstorm,told Fox News Digitallast month that the work visa program in the United States is a \"three-headed monster\" that needs to be drastically reformed in order to not leave American workers behind.\nEarlier this year, the Trump administrationunveiled a proposaldesigned to nudge employers toward offering higher salaries or reserving H-1B petitions for jobs that require advanced skills. The rule change, formally published in the Federal Register, came just days after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.\nThe $100,000 fee \u2014 a one-time charge applying only to new H-1B petitions \u2014 will take effect in the next annual lottery, the system the U.S. government uses to select applications once the annual visa cap is reached.\n\"The whole idea is no more will these Big Tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers. They have to pay the government $100,000, then they have to pay the employee, so it\u2019s just not [economical],\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said as Trump signed the order.\nAndrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Jamieson Greer addresses the legal uniqueness of the word \u2018tariff\u2019 on \u2018The Ingraham Angle.\u2019\nThe oral argument on Nov. 5 for theTrump tariffswas fascinating as justices struggled with the knotty question of whether a president has the sweeping authority claimed by President Donald Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The justices were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers. However, there is a real chance of a fractured decision that could still produce an effective win for the administration.\nFirst, the counsel. I was highly impressed by the performance of Solicitor General John Sauer, who did a brilliant job in weaving historical and precedential arguments in favor of the tariffs. He had a tough case and at times a tough audience, but maintained a coherent and consistent position.\nMany were surprised that the challengers selected the liberal firebrand Neil Katyal for counsel on the other side. Kavanaugh even made a quip about the incongruity of Katyal arguing for issues like non-delegation. Katyal struggled at points andJustice Amy Coney Barrettbashed him once for seemingly flipping his position in oral argument. However, Katyal made the key points against the claim of statutory and constitutional authority.\nTRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER'\nOverall, the administration faced worrisome moments in the argument, with Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly referring to tariffs as a clear \"tax\" and Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raising the \"major questions doctrine.\" Neither works well for the administration. If this is a tax, it is more likely viewed as a usurpation of Congress' inherent tax authority.\nAn exterior view of the Supreme Court on June 20, 2024, in Washington, D.C.

Much of this turned on the meaning of the terms \"regulate importation\" in IEEPA. Barrett asked pointedly: \"Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase, together with \u2018regulate importation,\u2019 has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?\"\nSauer stressed that a predecessor law was used in this manner, but Barrett repeatedly returned and was clearly not satisfied. At one point, Sotomayor (prematurely, in my view) snapped at Sauer and said, \"just answer the justice\u2019s question.\"\nTRUMP WARNS SUPREME COURT TARIFF SHOWDOWN IS 'LIFE OR DEATH' FOR AMERICA\nNevertheless, Barrett offered the administration some hope in their questioning of the challengers.\nShe zeroed in on the fact that licenses are within the power of the president:\nUnited States Supreme Court (front row L-R) Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts, Associate Justice Samuel Alito, and Associate Justice Elena Kagan, (back row L-R) Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pose for their official portrait at the East Conference Room of the Supreme Court building on October 7, 2022, in Washington, D.C.(OLIVIER DOULIERY\/AFP via Getty Images)\nJUSTICE BARRETT: \"So, this license thing is important to me. And do you agree that pursuant to IEEPA, the president could impose \u2014 could regulate commerce by imposing a license fee?\"\nKatyal seemed to struggle with this when Barrett noted that he had previously stated there is little difference between a license and a tariff. Barrett said that, if so, a president could regulate commerce in the same way with a license fee.\nSUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY\nMR. KATYAL: \"Not a fee. So, I should have said this earlier. But license is different from a licensing fee. IEEPA and TWEA authorize licenses, not license fees. And no president has ever charged, to my knowledge, fees under those two statutes for the licenses. So, fee is impermissible. License is OK.\"\nJUSTICE BARRETT: \"But I thought you conceded to Justice Gorsuch there was no difference between a tariff and a licensing fee functionally.\"\nNevertheless, Barrett offered the administration some hope in their questioning of the challengers.\nMR. KATYAL: \"Well, if the \u2014 if the licensing fee is just to \u2014 I didn't concede that.\"\nJUSTICE BARRETT: \"OK.\"\nBarrett kept telling Katyal that she was not following his arguments. Barrett also seemed intrigued by the incongruity that a president could use embargoes or quotas to effectively shut down trade entirely, so why shouldn't he be allowed to use the lesser of the powers?\nThe fifth vote could come from Gorsuch, but again, the rationales were strikingly different from those of the other justices.\nGorsuch clearly viewed the delegation of the authority as problematic and also raised the \"major questions doctrine.\" However, he was also the most effective in hammering Katyal on plain meaning arguments, noting the verb \"regulate\" is \"capacious.\"\nIf Gorsuch were to argue that the delegation is unconstitutional, he may find himself in the minority, but could then give the president the statutory argument on the broad implications of \"regulate importation.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh was the most useful for the administration in returning to the history ofPresident Richard Nixon's global 10% tariff, under the Trading with the Enemy Act, the predecessor of IEEPA.\nOverall, the administration faced worrisome moments in the argument, with Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly referring to tariffs as a clear \"tax\" and Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raising the \"major questions doctrine.\"\nHe also highlighted how, in FEA v.

At one point, he slammed Katyal's effort to rewrite the decision and said, \"Algonquin didn't have anything like that, but keep going.\"\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nThere is a chance that the challengers could eke out a majority with Barrett and possibly another conservative, such as Gorsuch or Roberts.

{"title":"Supreme Court weighs Trump tariff powers in blockbuster case","date":1762300800000,"body":"Supreme Court justices hear a major challenge to Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers to impose broad tariffs, a case that could reshape the balance of trade and presidential authority.\nThe Supreme Court weighed the legality of PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s use of an emergency law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on most U.S. trading partners on Wednesday \u2014 a blockbuster case, and one that experts say stretches far beyond matters of economic policy.\nAt issue before the court is whether the president can use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose two sweeping sets of tariffs on most countries, including a 10% global tariff Trump announced in April and the higher so-called reciprocal tariffs imposed on nearly 50 countries. Trump said at the time that trade deficits amounted to \"the precipice of an economic and national-security crisis\" sufficient to trigger his powers under IEEPA.\nJustices focused very little of their questions Wednesday on the economic impacts of Trump\u2019s tariff plans. Rather, the majority of the time during oral arguments centered on the IEEPA statute at the heart of the case, its applicability to tariffs or taxation powers \u2014 and what guardrails, if any, exist to limit the whims of an executive, should the high court rule in Trump\u2019s favor. The law in question authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" during a declared national emergency, but it does not mention the word \"tariffs.\"\nIn arguments, the administration told justices that IEEPA's allows a president to \"regulate\" \"importation\" of goods, which they said is the practical equivalent of a \"tariff.\"\nTRUMP TARIFF PLAN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS COURT BATTLES INTENSIFY\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on April 3, 2025, in Washington, D.C., shortly after announcing sweeping new tariffs.(Getty Images)\nBut several conservative justices questioned that, saying a tariff amounted to a tax on consumers.\n\"Is the constitutional assignment of the taxing power to Congress, the power to reach into the pockets of the American people, just different?\" Justice Neil Gorsuch asked, referring back to the founding of the country.\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett followed up, asking if there has \"ever been another instance in which a statute has used that language to confer the power\" that Trump seeks.\nOther conservative justices questioned whether an \"economic equivalent\" to tariffs could be used by the president under the law, such as sanctions, embargos, licenses, and quotas.\nThe two consolidated cases, Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, mark the first time during Trump's second term that the Supreme Court will review his policies fully on its merits, rather than through the so-called shadow docket, where justices have often sided with the administration in granting temporary stays and other emergency actions.\nUnlike other cases, this one also centers on an issue Trump considers to be the signature economic policy of his second term.\n\"Tomorrow\u2019s United StatesSupreme Courtcase is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our country,\" Trump said in a post on social media Tuesday night, adding that, without it, the U.S. is \"virtually defenseless against other countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us.\"\nLawyers for the Trump administration have argued in lower courts that the IEEPA allows a president to act in response to \"unusual and extraordinary threats\" and in cases where a national emergency has been declared. Trump has claimed that deep and \"sustained\" trade deficits amount to a national emergency that allows him to invoke IEEPA.\nPlaintiffs counter that in the 50 years since its passage, the law has never been used by a president to impose tariffs and that permitting the president to do so would drastically expand his powers at the expense of other branches of government. They contended to lower courts that Trump\u2019s use of IEEPA to address the trade deficit is unlawful, pointing out that, by the administration\u2019s own admission, the trade deficit has persisted for nearly 50 years, which they say undermines any claim of an \"unusual and extraordinary\" emergency.\nUS COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE SIDES WITH TRUMP IN TARIFF CASE\nSupreme Court justices attend President Trump's inaugural ceremony on January 20, 2025, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.(Ricky Carioti \/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\nJustices on Wednesday immediately jumped into what's known as the \"major question doctrine.\" Plaintiffs in the case have repeatedly argued that Trump\u2019s use of IEEPA violates the doctrine \u2014 which requires Congress to be explicit when it hands the executive branch powers to make decisions with a vast economic or political significance.\n\"Congress does not (and could not) use such vague terminology to grant the executive virtually unconstrained taxing power of such staggering economic effect \u2014 literally trillions of dollars \u2014 shouldered by American businesses and consumers,\" they told the court in an earlier briefing.\nU.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer acknowledged to the justices that IEEPA does not explicitly give an executive the power to regulate tariffs, though he argued that the power to tariff is \"the natural common sense inference\" of the 1977 law.\nJustices pressed Sauer as to why Trump invoked IEEPA to impose his sweeping tariffs, noting that doing so would be the first time a president used the law to set import taxes on trading partners.\nBarrett grilled Sauer at length on this issue, asking if he could point to \"any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase together \u2014 'regulate importation' \u2014 has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority.\"\nThey also noted that, unlike other statutes that delegate tariff authority to the president, IEEPA does not mention the word tariff, and some of the justices seemed skeptical of the administration's assertion that they do not need additional permission from Congress to use the law in such a sweeping manner.\nTRUMP WARNS SUPREME COURT TARIFF SHOWDOWN IS \u2018LIFE OR DEATH\u2019 FOR AMERICA\nJustice Elena Kagan pressed Sauer on the Trump administration's contention that IEEPA is only narrowly reviewable by the courts.\n\"We agree that it's a major power, but it's in the context of a statute that is explicitly conferring major powers,\" Sauer said. \"That the point of the statute is to confer major powers to address major questions \u2014 which are emergencies.\"\n\"So it would be unusual to say, look at the statute, say we're not going to find a major power. Well, but the exercise of the power is to impose tariffs. \"\nThat prompted a follow-up question from Gorsuch, who asked, \"Could Congress delegate to the president the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations as he sees fit and collect duties as he sees fit?\"\nGorsuch appeared skeptical of the administration's use of IEEPA, which would essentially cut out congressional oversight on the tariffs enacted under the law, and limit judicial review.\nBarrett and Gorsuch used their time to ask about the balance of powers, and how Congress could ever get the tariff delegation back if it was allocated to Trump under IEEPA.\nBoth justices posed a string of pointed questions to Sauer on the broad latitude that would be granted to Trump under the law, and their skepticism could prove telling in how the court eventually decides the case.\nIt's unclear how the court might rule on the matter, though Trump's laser-focus on the case was on sharp display, including with the attendance of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nA Fox News graphic that depicts how countries have responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs.(Fox News \/ MANDEL NGAN\/AFP via Getty Images)\nNeal Katyal, who helped argue the case on behalf of the plaintiffs, told justices Wednesday that Trump has \"torn up the entire tariff architecture.\"\nChief Justice John Roberts pressed Katyal on the foreign policy issues at play, noting that, unlike taxes, tariffs deal explicitly with foreign powers \u2014 which could give the president more latitude to act.\n\"It implicates, very directly, the president\u2019s foreign affairs power,\" Roberts noted at one point during the exchange.\nJudges for lower appeals courts previously pressed lawyers for the administration to explain why Trump invoked IEEPA when there are other, more narrow statutes enacted by Congress to specifically deal with tariffs. These laws include certain caps on tariff amounts, as well as timeframes reviewable by Congress. IEEPA, however, does not mention the word tariffs at all.\nBarrett and other justices nodded to this Wednesday in their own questions.\n\"Here, you\u2019re talking about something that is exclusively committed to Congress in Article One,\" Katyal said. \"When you have delegations, I would say \u2014 even when you have delegations in some military cases and emergency statutes \u2014 they have all sorts of limits.\"\nLower courts sided with plaintiffs from Democratic states and a coalition of small businesses against Trump, with a three-judge panel for the Court of International Trade ruling this summer that Trump's authorities under IEEPA are not \"unbounded.\"\nAppealing to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department has argued that \"denial of tariff authority would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses.\"\nSauer said in an earlier court filing thatnullifying the tariffswould have \"catastrophic consequences\" for national security and global supply chains.\nThe original lawsuits were brought in part by two related third-generation family-owned businesses who make \"hands-on educational toys and products for children,\" according to legal briefs filed by Learning Resources and hand2mind's, whose lawsuit was one of two consolidated cases reviewed by the high court.\nTheir products are developed and manufactured partly in the U.S. About 60% of the assembly is outsourced overseas to several Asian countries, including China and Thailand.\nRick Woldenberg, CEO of the two Chicago-area companies founded by his grandfather more than a century ago, said that a Supreme Court ruling for the Trump administration could put him out of business, and predicted that the tariffs would increase from $2.3 million in 2024 to $100.2 million this year.\n\"I wish I had $100 million,\" he told Fox News in an interview. \"Honest to God, no exaggeration: It feels like the end of days.\"\nWoldenberg said Trump's call to return manufacturing back to the U.S. is not practical, at least for his small businesses.\n\"I have been looking for American manufacturers for a long time,\" he said, \"and I have come up with zero companies to partner with.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nExperts say the impact of this case could stretch far beyond tariffs. A ruling in Trump's favor could cement a broad precedent for future administrations, which could then invoke national emergencies as a pretext to act without congressional review on a wide range of issues.\nUltimately, \"this is a separation of powers issue,\" Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel for the Liberty Justice Center and counsel for plaintiffs in one of the consolidated cases, told Fox News Digital in an interview.\n\"It's not about this president,\" he said, speaking on the eve of the oral arguments. \"It's about all presidents and the power that they have under the Constitution, and the powers that they don't have under the Constitution, and whether Congress can delegate those powers \u2014 and, if it does, how broad can those powers be?\"\n\"Everybody should be concerned about that,\" he said. \"Because even if you like what the president is doing now, you might not like what a future president does with the same power.\"\nBreanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering theTrump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI and other national news.

That is the question the Supreme Court is preparing this week to confront, in one of its most monumental appeals over the scope of executive power, a time-sensitive challenge to PresidentDonald Trump's expansive import tariffs over most countries.\nThe justices will hear oral arguments Wednesday over lawsuits from a coalition of small businesses and severalDemocratic-led states, who say Trump has abused his authority by declaring a \"national emergency\" to impose levies on nearly every country in the world.\nAt issue is whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) gives the president that power.\nTRUMP CUTS CHINA TARIFF AFTER XI SIGNALS TOUGHER FENTANYL ENFORCEMENT, RARE-EARTH PAUSE\nLower federal courts have ruled against the Executive Branch, butTrump's Justice Departmentwarns \"denial of tariff authority would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses.\"\nThe financial and political stakes are enormous, with potential immediate effects on the domestic and global economies. Businesses and industries, large and small, are nervously watching how the Court will act.\n\"The Supreme Court will decide whether or not Congress, in fact, gave the president the fairly broad authority that he's claimed to impose [tariffs] on, in a way that no president has used it before,\" said Thomas Dupree, a leading appellate attorney and a former top Justice Department official. \"Not to say that's necessarily impermissible, but it is something that the Supreme Court has not seen in recent years and is going to weigh in on whether or not he's overstepped the authority that he has under the law.\"\nThe consolidated, expedited appeals will be the first major test on the merits of the White House's aggressive second-term agenda to remake large swaths of the federal government, and the outsized role this president has so far played.\nThe administration has been winning most of the emergency appeals at the Supreme Court since January dealt only with whether challenged policies could go into effect temporarily, while the issues play out in the lower courts \u2014 including immigration, federal spending cuts, workforce reductions and transgenders in the military.\nThe facade of the Supreme Court building at dusk is shown in this file photo.(Drew Angerer\/Getty Images)\nIn doing so, the 6-3 conservative majority has reversed about two dozen preliminary nationwide injunctions imposed by lower federal courts, leading to frustration and confusion among many judges.\nNow those percolating petitions are starting to reach the Supreme Court for final review \u2014 and legal analysts say the bench may be poised to grant broad unilateral powers to the president.\nThe justices fast-tracked the administration's appeal over sweeping tariffs on nearly every country, which were blocked by lower courts.\nA high court ruling on the merits could come quickly, perhaps within weeks. Both sides have urged a quick decision, since the U.S. has been engaged in active,ongoing trade negotiationswith dozens of countries over the past months.\nThis could be the start of several high-profile merits appeals over Trump's executive actions.\nIn December, the justices will decide whether to overturn a 90-year precedent dealing with the president's ability to fire members of some federal regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission.\nSENATE REPUBLICANS DEFECT, REJECT TRUMP'S TARIFFS ON CANADIAN GOODS\nAnd in January, the power of President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors will be tested in another major constitutional showdown. For now, the Biden-appointed Cook will remain on the job.\nOther appeals that could be added to the high court argument docket include birthright citizenship and otherimmigration-related petitions, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies in educational institutions and the environment.\nCongress is given the power under the Constitution's Article I to \"lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.\"\nBut when Trump in February began issuing a series of executive orders, he relied on the IEEPA, which gives the president the power \u2014 under a self-declared national economic emergency \u2014 to \"investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.\"\nTheTrump Justice Departmentsays the choices are stark.\n\"President Trump and his advisors have determined that erroneously invalidating the IEEPA tariffs, 'would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy,'\" wrote U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who will argue the case before the justices.

He\u2019s anchored his Washington comeback on the idea of U.S. economic firepower, framing his battle cry around restoring American dominance in global trade and emerging technologies. In doing so, his administration has pressed allies and rivals alike to revisit trade terms, wielding tariffs as both weapon and warning.\n\"There are a lot of arrows in the Chinese quiver,\" Bryan Burack, a senior policy advisor for China and the Indo-Pacific at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. \"The fact of the matter is that they can literally make more moves than we can. They have more coercive tools to use against us, and they can deploy them easier,\" Burack added, pointing to U.S. industrial dependencies.\n\"China has been decoupling from us for a long time,\" Burack said. \"So a lot of these moves that look like retaliation are really part of Xi Jinping's long-standing effort to sever dependence on the United States and build self-reliance on critical technologies.

{"title":"Here's what Donald Trump and Joe Biden have in common on energy policy","date":1761696000000,"body":"Energy Secretary Chris Wright joins \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom\u2019 to discuss energy policy, crude oil prices and the ongoing government shutdown.\nThe late, great philosopher and New York Yankees baseball catcher, Yogi Berra, once declared, \"It's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.\" While Berra was referring to something relating to America\u2019s favorite pastime, the same could be said about recent decisions by the Trump administration tocancel offshore wind projectsup and down the East Coast, especially in comparison to the Biden administration\u2019s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline.\nAt first blush, these decisions might seem like exact opposites \u2014 one focused on renewable energy, the other at fossil fuels. But in reality, they are both political decisions that hurt confidence in theenergy industry, jeopardize jobs and ultimately affect our nation\u2019s domestic energy security. Predictability matters most when it comes to companies and workers in the energy field, whether you\u2019re laying gas pipelines, exploring for oil or constructing wind farms.\nAnd I\u2019m not alone in expressing these concerns. In recent weeks, Colette Hirstius, president of Shell USA, publicly questioned the Trump administration\u2019s decision to halt fully permitted wind projects, asserting it is \"very damaging\" to investment and calling for more consistency in regulation.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump shakes hands with President Joe Biden at Trump's inauguration in the Capitol Rotunda Jan. 20, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Kenny Holston-Pool\/Getty Images)\nShe reminded observers that \"energy projects with proper permits should be allowed to proceed,\" regardless of political decision-making. Companies like Shell are not simply defending wind farms. Hirstius went further and warned that the same playbook could be used against oil and gas projects.\nTHIS IS HOW AMERICA WILL ACHIEVE ENERGY DOMINANCE\nIn 2020, I served as a surrogate for the Biden campaign because I believed in his pragmatic record of legislative and policy accomplishments. I didn\u2019t agree with PresidentJoe Bidenon every issue, especially his decision to cancel Keystone XL, because it was more symbolic than substantive. No one energy project would have solved all of our energy problems, but Keystone XL represented a critical investment in domestic energy security, buoyed by years of environmental reviews, community engagement, permitting and industry planning. Canceling Keystone XL was wrong.\nLikeKeystone XL, offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, in construction off Rhode Island, and a series of projects near completion, had gone through years of reviews and approvals. Multiple companies had expended billions into planning, workforce training and supply chain development. Thousands of American workers, including welders, steelworkers, engineers and electricians, were relying on these projects forsteady employment.\nCanceling any energy project after construction has started doesn\u2019t just delay bringing on much-needed sources of new energy, it also undermines the very foundation of how we do business in this country. If an approved project can be canceled because of thechange of administrations, why would any company risk the capital to invest in future energy infrastructure? The result is paralysis.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nWe are living through a period defined by both surging energy demand and increasing geopolitical instability. Families are struggling with high energy costs driven by bothconstrained supply and overregulation. The solution here is to pursue domestic energy resources of every kind.\nIn this environment, the commonsense strategy is not to pick winners and losers \u2014 but to pursue an \"all of the above\" energy policy that draws on every resource at our disposal, including oil, gas, nuclear, solar, hydro, and yes, wind. America should be producing more energy, not less. Both the Keystone XL and offshore wind cancellations undercut that vision. Instead of working to maximize capacity and diversify supply, they shrank the pie.\nFor decades, America\u2019s debates over energy have been cast in zero-sum terms: oil and gas vs. renewables, coal jobs vs. clean technology, pipelines vs. wind turbines, with activists and industries battling it out in the courts and the court of public opinion. In reality, these false choices have done little to actually serve our energy, environmental or economic interests as Americans. We need them all \u2013 particularly homegrown, American-made sources of energy.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAn \"all of the above\" energy strategy is not just good economics; it\u2019s also good politics. Voters are tired of the pendulum swings, and tired of being told they have to choose one camp over another. They don\u2019t want energy scarcity and blackouts. They want energy independence \u2013 something PresidentDonald Trumpaggressively campaigned on. They want America to lead, not lag. And they want jobs\u2014whether those jobs are in the oil field, building state-of-the-art reactors or the shipyard assembling wind turbines.\nCanceling Keystone XL was a mistake, and canceling permitted, financed and under construction wind projects is a mistake.

Our success depends on thriving innovation and robust investment \u2013 two integral pieces of our national battle plan.\nBut the third component of victory can\u2019t be overlooked: The U.S. urgently needs evenbetter internet infrastructure. If we don\u2019t extend our advantage in 21st-century connectivity, we will lose the fight for global AI leadership.\nAt this very moment, leaders in D.C. are debating the best approach to AI regulation. On the other side of the country, Silicon Valley is chasing the next breakthrough AI model. But even as the U.S. does both of those things, Beijing is playing a different game.\nThe Chinese Communist Party understands that AI supremacy depends on leveraging a national approach to building the infrastructure and connectivity required to develop and deploy advanced AI systems.(Getty Images)\nTheChinese Communist Partyunderstands that AI supremacy depends not only on data and algorithms, but on leveraging a national approach to building the infrastructure and connectivity required to develop and deploy advanced AI systems. It is building internet infrastructure to leapfrog the U.S.\nTRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA\nFor instance, China is challenging America\u2019s long-standing leadership in Wi-Fi innovation\u00a0by pushing its domestic standards internationally and directing resources into homegrown wireless technologies, both to the detriment of U.S. standards and technology, which have long led the way in Wi-Fi.\nWi-Fi matters because it\u2019s theprimary technologyconsumers use to access AI on their devices. The ability to move, process and deliver data at a large scale is the backbone of AI. Every generative AI query, self-driving vehicle and factory robot depends on light speed and reliable connectivity. If China takes the lead on any kind of internet infrastructure, it will soon take the lead on AI, too.\nThe good news is that the American cable industry has made significant progress in building broadband networks that offer the scale to meet this moment, with 87% already offering gigabit speeds, and even more powerful capabilities on the horizon. Over the past two decades, $340 billion in private capital has been invested to build these powerful networks,\u00a0generating\u00a0$568.7 billion in economic output in 2024 alone and supporting more than 1.3 million jobs nationwide.\nCHINA'S MALIGN INFLUENCE TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF US LIFE. WE ALL NEED TO HELP STOP THEM\nThese infrastructure investments matter \u2013 but they must also be matched by commitment\u00a0from\u00a0government, as part of a national strategy to extend U.S. internet leadership. Such a strategy isn\u2019t just crucial to AI's future use and reliability; it would also amplify the economic impact that such infrastructure has. In California alone, cable infrastructure supports 209,000 jobs and drives $117 billion in state economic impact. Texas and Florida each sustain more than 100,000cable-related jobs.\nThis is what national strength looks like: private capital fueling the public good. And with a national strategy for internet infrastructure, that good could be multiplied on a massive scale.\nDuring a recent tech policy conversation I had with Rep. Brett Guthrie, the House Energy and Commerce Committee chair, he framed the choice starkly: \"We're not competing with Europe to regulate, we're competing with China to innovate.\" He's right. Europe\u2019s overregulation has already left them out of the AI race. The U.S. is still in the race, and if we hope to win it, we must continue to innovate and expand our internet infrastructure.\nAMERICA MUST WIN THE AI RACE \u2013 AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST\nNow is the time to leverage America\u2019s strengths, doubling down on Wi-Fi capacity,broadband connectivity and the infrastructurethat makes them possible. For years, and because of far-sighted national policies, Wi-Fi has been the internet\u2019s workhorse, handling the vast majority of all internet traffic and linking our homes, offices, schools and factories.\nIt\u2019s also a uniquely American success story \u2013 one rooted in the value of permissionless innovation and rules that support the freedom to access public airwaves. Imagine if thefederal governmentmade that story even more successful by further expanding access to Wi-Fi. China wouldn\u2019t have a chance in the AI fight.\nWinning the AI race will require focus and urgency. As soon as possible, leaders in D.C. should create a national framework for broadband policy, replacing the current state-by-state regulatory minefield that holds back the infrastructure America needs.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nWe also need a better national policy on unlicensed spectrum \u2013 the radio frequencies that undergird Wi-Fi \u2013 to ensure our country\u2019s continued Wi-Fi leadership. And we must maintain federal incentives that fuel private investment in internet infrastructure to meet AI\u2019s massive data demands.\nIf we get this right, the United States won\u2019t just compete in the AI era \u2013 we\u2019ll indisputably lead it and leave China in the dust. The same networks connecting Americans today will secure our economic success, our technological leadership and our national future tomorrow.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCory\u00a0Gardner is the president and CEO of NCTA.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/americas-secret-weapon-crush-china-global-ai-race","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1,"topic_inflation":0,"topic_taxes":0,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

Whether this tactic proves effective remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the president has been even more effective than he was in his first term when it comes to getting other nations to honor their commitments.\u00a0This fact has been most prominent when it comes to defense spending.\nIn 2006,America\u2019s NATO alliesagreed to spend\u00a02% of\u00a0their GDP\u00a0on defense. After several years of little progress, the Obama administration secured an\u00a0updated agreement\u00a0in 2014 that all would achieve this goal by 2024.\u00a0Yet when Trump first entered office in 2017, only\u00a0five\u00a0of 28 nations had met that\u00a0mark.\nThe president and his national security team, including me, pressed our allies hard back then to live up to their commitments.\u00a0By 2021, the number of NATO members doing so had\u00a0doubled\u00a0and allied military spending increased considerably.\nPresident Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaks during a news conference following the NATO Summit on June 25, 2025, in The Hague, Netherlands.

This should be more apparent when it comes to futuretrade talks with China.\nThe communist state has\u00a0violated\u00a0its obligations and reneged on numerous agreements for decades, from the theft of intellectual property to currency manipulation and the unfair subsidization of Chinese companies.

Ron DeSantis and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, have handled crime control well and have kept taxes low, something he said are the keys to their success.

Farmers said they have harvested at least 15% fewer pumpkins this year.\nCROSS PLAINS, Tenn. \u2013 Many pumpkin patches won\u2019t look the same this year as drought conditions across the United States leave farmers with empty fields.\nThe National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska estimates around 38% of the United States is experiencing a \u2018moderate drought,\u2019 which the National Weather Service defines by damaged crops, low water wells and developing water shortages.\nPumpkin farmers \u2014 including those in Cross Plains, Tennessee \u2013 are dealing with drought conditions for a second straight year. Stephen Freeland\u2019s pumpkins are growing in 14 acres of bone-dry soil.

We probably dropped 15 to 20 percent,\" Freelanad said.\"It's just a roulette of the rain.

He said the first set of pumpkins harvested received adequate water and came out normal. However, the seeds he planted later endured weeks of heat \u2014 but with no rain.\n\"The thing with pumpkins, when it gets 95, 98 degrees, the pumpkin plant wants to abort the fruit that it just pollinated,\" Freeland said.\nWhen it gets too hot, Freeland said pumpkin plants start to wilt, and their flowers fall off more easily. On a warm day, the flowers stay open for shorter periods of time, which affects pollination.\nFarmers say long periods of heat with no rain can cause pumpkin plants to wilt, which affects pollination.(Fox News)\nFarmers have found ways to alleviate the stress caused by the drought. Freeland added drip irrigation lines to his pumpkin field by pumping water from his well. A water line then allows smaller amounts of water to drip directly onto a plant's roots.\nAgricultural adaptation can be costly and force farmers toraise their prices, although their pumpkins are smaller.\n\"The downside is if you need to raise prices, but your size is not there, that makes it a little more difficult,\" Freeland said. \"They're just smaller, less marketable.\"\nSome farmers installed drip irrigation lines to slowly drip water directly onto the pumpkin's roots.(Fox News)\nCOSTCO SHOPPERS RAVE OVER SEASONAL PIE THAT'S NEARLY 4 POUNDS AND LESS THAN $6\nKatie Osborne\u2019s family farm includes 20 acres of pumpkins and 70 head of cattle.

{"title":"Farmageddon: Trump\u2019s trade war and shutdown are crushing the heartland","date":1760659200000,"body":"Farmers in southern Illinois say drought, high costs, and China\u2019s trade freeze are driving soybean profits below break even this season.\nI\u00a0warned in May thatAmerica\u2019s farm economywas under attack \u2014 that tariffs, Agriculture Department program cuts and political posturing in Washington were hammering farmers from the farm gate to the dinner plate. Four months later, that picture has only grown worse.\nAcross the Midwest, combines sit idle and bins overflow with unsold grain. Corn prices are down nearly 50% since 2022. Soybeans have\u00a0dropped 40%. Fertilizer and equipmentcosts are up\u00a0double digits. And\u00a08 in 10 farmers now say they believe the U.S. is on the brink of another farm crisis reminiscent of the 1980s. They\u2019ve even given it a name: Farmageddon.\nThis time, the crisis isn\u2019t a result of macroeconomic conditions \u2014 it\u2019s a direct result of decisions made by the White House. PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s reckless tariff war is crushing America\u2019s farmers.\nPresident Donald Trump talks to the media after walking off Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Oct. 5, 2025.(Tasos Katopodis\/Getty Images)\nTake soybeans.China has retaliatedon U.S. tariffs with a total boycott of U.S. soybeans, leaving bumper crops rotting in silos across Ohio, Iowa and Illinois. Meanwhile, new tariffs on fertilizer, steel and equipment have driven up production costs for nearly every crop and commodity.\nTRUMP'S TARIFFS FORCE CHINA TO FEEL THE HEAT\nThe math doesn\u2019t pencil out: higher costs on the front end, lower prices and fewer markets on the back end. It\u2019s a squeeze no amount of wishful thinking can fix.\nAnd while U.S. farmers struggle to move their grain, the administration just finalized a bailout for Argentina \u2014 a country that turned around and cut a deal with China to buy its soybeans instead of ours. Think about that: Washington is bailing out a competitor to our farmers on the brink of crisis.\nUnfortunately, we saw this same movie during Trump\u2019s last trade war. Farm bankruptcies soared to record highs, andBrazil walked awaywith our export markets. Now Argentina is lining up to do the same. And everyone knows that once you lose market share, you rarely get it back.\nThis isn\u2019t just economics. It\u2019s deeply personal. It\u2019s the difference between keeping the family farm for another generation and auctioning off the tractor. It\u2019s the creases across anOhio farmer\u2019s faceas he struggles to tell me he\u2019s not sure whether he wants his children to have this way of life.\nTRUMP IS USING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO DO SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER DONE\nAnd the White House is only making it harder. Despite total control of Washington, the president\u2019s party has shut down the government rather than extend enhanced premium tax credits that keep healthcare affordable. Finding affordable healthcare as a farmer is difficult enough as it stands. But now, premiums are set to skyrocket. In fact, in rural countries, they are set to increase an\u00a0average of 107%, a larger increase than in our cities.\nMoreover, when USDA shuts down, farmers get shut out. That means delays to critical farm loans, conservation payments and disaster relief. For farmers, it\u2019s a double whammy: no markets, no safety net, and now, no one to pick up the phone.\nWhat is the solution? Well, the president is floating a $14 billion bailout for farmers \u2014 a temporary fix for a self-inflicted wound. We saw how this went in the first trade war,\u00a0when payments were mismanaged and failed to help the farmers who were the hardest hit.\nEven the president\u2019s allies are skeptical. I agree with Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., who said funding bailouts with tariff revenue is \"like putting a Band-Aid on cancer.\" Farmers don\u2019t want bailouts; they want a fair shake. They want open markets, stable policy and a government that has their back.\nSo let\u2019s be clear: There is a way out of this mess.\nARE PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S TARIFFS ACTUALLY WORKING?\nFirst, reopen the government and extend the enhanced premium tax credits that a\u00a0quarter of all farmers rely on. It\u2019s time to get the USDA back to full strength and ensure that rural families can afford their health coverage.\nSecond, end the trade war that\u2019s hollowing out American agriculture. Stop punishing the very people who feed and fuel this country.\nThird, if the president won\u2019t endhis reckless trade war, Congress must step in to reclaim our constitutional authority over tariff policy. I plan to introduce legislation soon that would require USDA to report on the impact of any proposed tariffs on farm country, giving farmers an extra tool to plan for the future. I welcome my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join.\nAnd finally, let\u2019s expand domestic markets by authorizing year-round E15 fuel. This is a commonsense, bipartisan step that would boost corn demand, lower gas prices and strengthen our energy independence.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThis is only a start, but our farmers need a real plan.\nBecause what\u2019s happening in farm country isn\u2019t some distant problem. It\u2019s America\u2019s problem. When farms go under, towns go quiet. When farmers stop buying seed, tractors and feed, the hardware store closes, the diner empties, and the local school loses its tax base.

{"title":"Five ways the Trump administration can save the American Dream and prevent socialism","date":1759708800000,"body":"Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram and Fox News contributor Kim Strassel join 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the government shutdown and the escalating tensions between parties.\nYoung people are demoralized and are turning to the promises of socialism. While socialism is entirely decoupled from reality, young Americans are frustrated, believing that the American Dream is out of reach. In a recent survey, almost a third of Millennials and nearly 40% of Gen Z said they believe they will never own a home.\nWhile wrongly identifying capitalism as the culprit for the ills of cronyism and central planning, including monetary and fiscal policy that has increased the cost of living, their concerns are real and valid. Whereas in the past, there have been periods with high interest rates with reasonable home prices, and periods with low interest rates and high home prices, would-be homebuyers today are contending with both.\nIf a home is the physical embodiment of theAmerican Dream, it shouldn\u2019t feel out of reach. Here are some suggestions to once again make the American Dream attainable.\nFAITH IN AMERICAN DREAM DWINDLES AMID SOUR ECONOMIC SENTIMENTS, POLL FINDS\nLower mortgage rates through more assumable loans\nIt is estimated that less than a quarter of mortgages in the US are assumable. Many homebuyers financed or refinanced their homes during the Fed\u2019s 15-year low-interest rate bonanza and therefore, don\u2019t want to sell their homes and give up their low mortgage interest rates. This has clogged up the housing market.\nFurthermore, today\u2019s mortgage rates, coupled with high housing costs, are making the homes that are available too costly.\nThegovernment should workwith the banks to make more mortgages assumable (of course, making sure the assuming party is creditworthy, and perhaps limiting that to homes that will be primary residences).\nWhile banks generate sizable fees from loan originations, right now, the clogged market is limiting their business anyway. If loan assumability came with a right of first refusal for the lending institution to refinance the remainder needed for the mortgage, it would be a win-win. Banks would increase originations and the blended rate would be lower for homebuyers.\nPlus, taxpayers have helped the banks out a lot, to put it mildly, over the past few decades, sogetting some concessionson their side is quite fair.\nCreate incentives for smaller footprint housing\nOne of the reasons that housing is so expensive is that we have had square footage creep. Homes today, on average, are more than double the size they were in the 1950s. Per US Census Bureau data, new construction homes averaged 983 square feet in the 1950s, 1,200 square feet in the 1960s, around 1,500 square feet in the 1970s and are between 2,200 and 2,300 square feet on average today, even though the household size has shrunk. Note that median data for the period was similar.\nIt's acomplicated matter. Why would a homebuilder choose to build a smaller home when they could make a bigger profit on a larger one for an incremental amount of extra work?\nThis is where tax incentives, both locally and federally, could help prompt builders to build smaller footprint housing that would also be more affordable, particularly for young people.\nFix balance sheets by solving the student loan burden\nEven if a house is in range of a potential homebuyer\u2019s earnings, if they are saddled with debt, making a home purchase becomes a non-starter.\nTheUS governmentis the largest predatory lender in the country, saddling teenagers and young adults with tens of thousands of dollars in debt and delaying their ability to make investments, while enriching colleges and their administrators. Getting the government out of student lending and thereby making colleges and universities right-size education costs to the value the education provides will clean up young people\u2019s personal balance sheets and help make homeownership more attainable.\nYou can read more of my thoughts onhow to do that here.\nAddress rising property taxes and insurance\nIt\u2019s one thing to be able to afford buying a house. It\u2019s quite another thing to afford the ongoing carrying costs. Property taxes and insurance have become incredibly cumbersome. It is reported that, on average, taxes and insurance make up almost a third of single-family mortgage payments, and for 9% of single-family homeowners, taxes and insurance comprise more than half of the mortgage payment.\nThere should be an effort, even if undertaken at the local level, to dial back these costs, or fewer Americans will never be able to afford a house (not to mention the overall questionable moral framework for property taxes).\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAddress corporations buying single family homes\nThis is an area that I wrote about extensively in my last bestselling book, You Will Own Nothing. Before 2010, there was effectively no institutional money buying single-family homes. But, in Q1 2025, nearly 27% of single-family homes purchased were bought by investors, with some portion of that being institutional buyers.\nMany of the institutionally-backed companies convert single-family homes they purchase torental properties, taking those dwellings out of the buyable supply and renting Americans back a shadow of the American Dream.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhile I hate central planning and prefer free markets, there has been nothing free market about the advantages that give these companies the ability to get cheap capital and go in and compete for single-family homes. Additional fees, taxes or limitations, at least until the market is normalized, could be a good way to level the playing field for average Americans.\nThe housing problem may be temporary, as baby boomers will eventually age out and sell their homes. However, it is still worthwhile to come up with solutions today, even if short-term, to make owning a home a realistic, attainable, goal for hardworking Americans.\nCarol Roth is a former investment banker, entrepreneur and author of the new book\"You Will Own Nothing\"Broadside Books.

To do that, they need to see themselves in terms of the unique, transferable gifts they've been given, which can be applied to a wide variety of jobs in just about any industry.\nOne of the best ways I know to identify those gifts is through the idea of \"Working Genius.\" There are six types of work that show up in every job, in every industry:\nThe truth is, none of us is good at all six. Every person in any industry has two types of work that give them energy and joy; this is where your Working Geniuses lie.\nJOBS THAT ARE MOST AT RISK FROM AI, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT\nOn the other hand, everyone has two types that drain them and that they don\u2019t do well.

Let's say that your geniuses are Invention and Tenacity. That means you enjoy developing novel ideas and then pursuing solutions diligently until they are finished.\nAs you look for a job, you can now look far beyond programming and even technology, exploring a much broader spectrum of job opportunities that need someone with your geniuses. In doing this, you\u2019ll realize that there are plenty of roles in a wide variety of industries that need someone like you, and that your prospects of success and job satisfaction will be much higher in a job that fits your talents.\nIronically, you might find that your previous job didn't exactly allow you to use your geniuses. Many people get jobs in fields they studied in school, and many just fall into a job by circumstance. But intentionally pursuing acareerthat aligns better with their geniuses can lead to them realizing that getting laid off, as hard as it may have been, was exactly what they needed.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOf course, no job is perfect.

{"title":"This agency targets individual Americans and small businesses \u2014 it must be reformed","date":1759449600000,"body":"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on where things stand as the government shuts down for the first time since 2019 on \u2018Fox News @ Night.\u2019\nAs someone whose life\u2019s work is helping small businesses navigate our nation\u2019scomplex tax system, I have witnessed firsthand how the Internal Revenue Service has become an outsized force that too often targets those least equipped to fight back. While the agency has long maintained that its enforcement efforts are focused on large corporations and the ultra-wealthy, the truth is that small businesses and middle-class families bear the brunt of its actions.\nThe IRS often investigates businesses that take advantage of legal tax breaks, and it's a lot easier for them to go after the little guy than to take on the armies of lawyers and accountants that big businesses have at their disposal. This imbalance is not only unfair, but it is also damaging our economy, killing jobs and undermining the entrepreneurial spirit that defines America.\nIn March, former IRS whistleblowers Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were\u00a0promoted\u00a0to leadership positions at the Treasury Department with the mandate of reforming the IRS. This is a welcome development. Shapley and Ziegler certainly have their work cut out for them.\nSEN RICK SCOTT, REP BYRON DONALDS: TRUMP\u00a0AND\u00a0BESSENT'S IRS REFORM: LET\u2019S END JOB-KILLING POLICIES\nTime and again, IRS audits fall disproportionately on small businesses and individuals making less than $400,000 a year.Larger corporationscan afford to absorb the burden of lengthy audits, but for a small business, an audit can be devastating. The process is time-consuming, expensive and distracting, often forcing business owners to divert resources away from serving customers, paying employees and growing their companies.\nA 2023 Government Accountability Office report\u00a0revealed\u00a0that more than 90 percent of audits are against middle-class families and small businesses under the $400,000 threshold. It is clear that major corporations and billionaire tax cheats are not the primary targets in the IRS\u2019s crosshairs.\nThankfully, the previous administration\u2019s desire toexpand the IRSby tens of thousands of new agents was\u00a0thwarted\u00a0by President Donald Trump, who announced a hiring freeze in January\u00a0to protect small businesses and middle-class families from being swept into an audit dragnet. But, Trump\u2019s action also underscored a critical truth: the IRS still wields immense power with far too little accountability, and without serious reform, that power will continue to be abused.\nThe broader economic consequences of this imbalance are enormous. Small businesses are the backbone of job creation in America, yet they are being discouraged from investing, hiring and expanding because they fear the IRS will punish them for success.\nI have spoken with countless entrepreneurs who quietly hold back on growth because they don\u2019t want the extra scrutiny. Thischilling effectis invisible to most policymakers, but it is real. When entrepreneurs choose caution over expansion, jobs are not created, innovation is stifled and communities miss out on economic opportunity.\nMeanwhile, the compliance burden gives large corporations a competitive advantage, because they can hire teams of professionals to handle audits and disputes while smaller firms are left exposed. The result is a system that entrenches big business and suppresses competition, the exact opposite of what a healthy free-market economy should promote.\nWe can and must do better.Reforming the IRSshould begin with rebalancing its priorities. Enforcement is important, but it should not come at the expense of fairness and service. Congress should establish clear limits on how many small business returns can be audited each year and require the IRS to justify its audit selections with transparent metrics. Independent appeals processes must be strengthened so that small businesses can contest government overreach without going bankrupt in the process.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAny new IRS funding should be redirected toward improving taxpayer services, simplifying compliance, and providing timely guidance. The IRS should also be required to publicly report audit outcomes, including how many audits end with no changes or in favor of taxpayers, so Americans can see for themselves whether enforcement is being carried out fairly.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSmall businesses are not asking for special treatment; they are asking for a level playing field. They are willing to pay their fair share, but they should not be disproportionately burdened simply because they lack the resources to fight back. America\u2019s prosperity has always been built on the backs of entrepreneurs willing to take risks and create opportunities. If those individuals believe every step forward might trigger a costly audit, many will hesitate and our economy will suffer.\nFor the sake of fairness, for the sake of growth and for the sake of America\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit, we need toreform the IRSnow. An agency that punishes the vulnerable while letting the powerful escape scrutiny is not serving the people. A tax system that discourages job creation is failing the nation. If we want small businesses to thrive and the economy to grow, we must put the little guy back on an equal footing and make the IRS accountable to the people it is meant to serve.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/agency-targets-individual-americans-small-businesses-must-reformed","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":0,"topic_crypto":0}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright announced on Sept. 29 agovernment-led initiative to boost coaluse and production in the U.S. As he told Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo in an interview: this will not sit well with the Chardonnay set.\nAs electricity prices soar across the U.S., thanks in part to dogged efforts by blue-state officials to dump fossil fuels, those climate-obsessed voices will be drowned out by those of struggling consumers.\nOver the two decades from January 1985 through January 2005,electricity prices in the U.S.climbed by only 19%; in the following 20 years until January of this year, electricity prices exploded by more than 90%. Just this year, the price per kilowatt-hour has jumped another 6%.\nTRUMP'S UN SPEECH REVEALS INCONVENIENT TRUTH OF MASSIVE GREEN ENERGY COSTS\nIn California, the trends are even worse as Golden State residents pay almost double the average charge in the U.S. People living in New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts are similarly paying much higher prices than the national average. Why the disparity? Because Democrat-run states have purposefully shifted to high-cost and unreliable renewable energy.\nThe Sherburne County Generating Station is pictured in Becker, Minnesota.(Education Images\/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\nIn New York, as governor, Andrew Cuomo banned fracking and banned new pipelines from bringing much-needed and cheaper natural gas into his state. New Jersey and other blue states promoted similar measures, while embracing renewables like offshore wind and solar that are intermittent and therefore need backup, usually provided by natural gas. This is not efficient, and it is costly.\nUnlike the Biden administration, theTrump White House understandsthat the demand for energy over the next few years, thanks in particular to AI and other new technologies, will expand at a pace that will truly demand an \"all of the above\" approach. That means not just increased oil and natural gas production, investments in solar and other renewables, but alsomore reliance on nuclear powerand \u2014 yes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0on coal.\nTRUMP'S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS\nPresidentBarack Obama,Biden and other climate warriors have, for years, waged war against coal, which today accounts for 15% of electricity production, down from half as recently as 2000. In 2016, then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proudly claimed her cleanenergypolicies would \"put a lot ofcoal minersand coal companies out of business,\" a boneheaded remark that showed how out of touch the former first lady was with the needs of working-class Americans. At the time, there were some 70,000 coal miners in the U.S.; today, that has shrunk to 40,000.\nPresidentDonald Trumprecognizes that one of the greatest assets of the United States, enhancing our ability to compete in next-generation technology, is our abundant cheap energy, and especially coal. The government\u2019s Energy Information Administration wrote last year, \"In the United States, coal resources are larger than remaining natural gas and oil resources.\" In addition, it reported that, \"As of Jan. 1, 2024, the demonstrated reserve base (DRB) was estimated to contain 469 billion short tons of coal.\"\nThe 2024 production was just above 500 million short tons, or less than half of the amount produced in 2008. Roughly speaking, we could double current coal output and produce at that level for hundreds of years. That is not an asset any government should ignore.\nThe Chinese certainly would not let such a reserve go to waste. While the U.S. and Europe sacrifice using cheap coal in favor of higher-cost renewables in their quest to cut carbon emissions, theChinese are building coal-fired power plantsas rapidly as they can, the environmental consequences be damned.\nTRUMP ADMIN PUTS $625M TOWARD KEEPING COAL PLANTS OPEN, LOWER ENERGY COSTS\nWhile China is opening coal plants, the U.S. has been shutting ours down. The White House will change that. The government is planning tospend $625 million,including $350 million to modernize coal plants, $175 million for coal projects that will target rural communities and some $100 million to make existing plants cleaner and more efficient. Overall, the objective is to keep more plants running, including dozens that were slated to close.\nThis is not the first move made by the Trump White House to expand coal\u2019s role in our energy system. In spring, the president signed an executive order instructing the head of the National Energy Dominance Council to designate coal as a \"mineral\"; the purpose was to \"streamline permitting,\"\u00a0which would allow more leasing and ultimately more production overall, and, specifically, on federal lands. The\u00a0president also demanded that agencies reduce \"barriers\" to coal mining and \"rescind any agency policies that seek to transition the nation away from coal production.\"\nSmoke and steam rise from a coal processing plant in Hejin in central China's Shanxi Province on Nov. 28, 2019.(AP Photo\/Olivia Zhang, File)\nWright told Bartiromo that,\"We\u2019re going to export more of that coal, we\u2019re going to use it for American industry, particularly as we reindustrialize, and it\u2019s going to continue to provide 15%-16% of our electricity and enable us to reindustrialize and win the AI race.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe Trump administration is not just focused on coal. It is also pushing for higher oil and natural gas production, reversing Biden\u2019s slow-walking of drilling permits and leasing. Oil production is up about 3% this year, but that is just the beginning.\nTRUMP ADMIN TACKLES URGENT ELECTRICAL GRID CRISIS AS AI SET TO DOUBLE DEMAND\nIn August, the Department of the Interior proposed a new oil and gas offshore leasing plan that includes 30 auctions in the Gulf of America through 2040 and six auctions in Alaska\u2019s Cook Inlet through 2032. That\u2019s a far cry from the Biden administration\u2019s plan, which scheduled a total of only three oil and gas lease sales \u2014 the minimum required by the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden leased fewer federal acres for oil and gas than any president since World War II.\nWhile China is opening coal plants, the U.S. has been shutting ours down. The White House will change that.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNuclear, too, is getting a boost from the Trump White House. In May, Trump initiated a \"nuclear energy renaissance,\" directing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline the approval process for new reactors, including setting a new 18-month deadline for licensing decisions. The goal? Increase U.S. nuclear energy capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.\nThis \"all of the above\" energy renewal program \u2014 exploiting this country\u2019s vast energy resources\u00a0\u2014\u00a0may well become President Trump\u2019s greatest legacy. We need energy to compete \u2026 and to make America great again.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/liz-peek-trump-white-house-fired-up-about-king-coals-return-power","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":0,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

{"title":"Trump\u2019s H-1B visa reform plan needs to put Americans first","date":1759104000000,"body":"NSI Deputy Executive Director Martha Miller joins \u2018Fox News Live\u2019 to discuss the State Department\u2019s warning to foreigners not to glorify the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk.\nPresidentDonald Trump\u2019s executive order just put a$100,000 fee on new petitionsfor H-1B temporary workers. The rollout suffered from muddled communication, and the order does not stop the H-1B from being used to replace American workers \u2014 but it\u2019s a sorely needed first step.\nCreated more than 30 years ago to fill a temporary labor shortage, the H-1B has ballooned beyond its intended scope. It needs to be reformed to put American workers first.\nExplaining how the H-1B went so far off the rails would take a whole report \u2014 which is why I\u2019ve written one, coming out soon. Meanwhile, here are some of the problems.\nTRUMP\u2019S $100K H-1B VISA OVERHAUL COULD HIT TECH GIANTS LIKE AMAZON AND MICROSOFT HARDEST\nH-1Bs allow companies to replace American workers with cheap foreign labor and suppress wages for Americans. Exceptions to the original H-1B annual cap of 65,000 visas each fiscal year have expanded the number far beyond statutory limits.\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order about H-1B visas at the White House on Friday, Sept. 19, 2025.(Aaron Schwartz\/CNP\/Bloomberg\/Getty Images)\nFirst, 20,000 more were set aside for applicants with a master's degree or higher degree. Then, H-1Bs for universities and government research organizations were made cap-exempt. Then DHS allowed the spouses of H-1B holders to work.\nFraud, nepotism and corruption have long compromised the H-1B process. Outsourcing firms and \"body shops\" rig the labor market to hire foreign workers over Americans.\nFOREIGN TRAVELERS SOON TO PAY 'VISA INTEGRITY FEE' TO VISIT THE U.S. COSTING $250\nYet there is no shortage of domestic science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) graduates. Every year, the U.S. produces more graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer science and engineering than the economy demands, and overall, only 28% of workers with a STEM degree actually work in a STEM job.\nThere are some high-talent H-1Bs, but as Howard University Political Science Professor Ron Hira says, the typical H-1B recipients \"are ordinary skilled workers\" who could be supplied domestically.\nAmazon, Intel, Google, Microsoft and many other companies have let American workers go while they continued to hire thousands of H-1Bs. Companies predictably deny any connection between the two phenomena, but laid-off U.S. workers insist otherwise. In 2020, the site White Collar Workers of America ranked the \"Misfortune 500\" body shops most-abusive of H-1Bs. In some cases, companies even require Americans they are sacking to train their foreign replacements.\nOn Sept. 25, Iowa Republican Sen.Chuck Grassleyand Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin wrote to the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and other large American companies asking for specific information about their hiring of H-1Bs, saying \"we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions.\"\nDOJ CALLS FOR TIPS ON EMPLOYERS FAVORING FOREIGN WORKERS IN HIRING PRACTICES\nH-1Bs were supposed to be limited to three years, but holders can renew up to six years. And if an alien can\u2019t get a green card because of the cap (no one country is allowed more than 7% of the annual visas), he can get three-year extensions indefinitely.\nMany of the top employers of H-1B workers are foreign-based outsourcers who hire thousands of low-wage H-1Bs and farm them out to U.S. industry. More than 70% of new H-1B workers are from India, with China a distant second at 11%.\nH-1Bs allow companies to replace American workers with cheap foreign labor and suppress wages for Americans. Exceptions to the original H-1B annual cap of 65,000 visas each fiscal year have expanded the number far beyond statutory limits.\nBy going through an outsourcing firm, U.S. companies can pay less and avoid negative publicity when replacing Americans. In 2024, hundreds of subcontractors filed for H-1Bs on behalf of Verizon, Wells Fargo, and Walmart. From 2020 to 2024, Citigroup hired more than 3,000 new H-1B workers via outsourcers, who paid them less than those Citi hired directly.\nMany H-1B subcontractors commit unscrupulous or illegal practices. In 2024, Kishore Dattapuram and Kumar Aswapathi, owners of Nanosemantics in San Jose, California, pled guilty in an H-1B visa case. According to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, \"In pleading guilty, Dattapuram admitted to working with Aswapathi and Giri to submit fraudulent H-1B applications that falsely represented that foreign workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated end-client companies when, in fact, the jobs did not exist.\"\nKEY IMMIGRATION PROPOSAL VOWS TO END 'BACKDOOR HIRING PRACTICES' IN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES\nOutsourcing giant Cognizant has successfully petitioned for over 52,000 new H-1B workers since 2009, the highest of any company. In 2024, Cognizant was found liable for intentionally discriminating against more than 2,000 non-Indian employees between 2013 and 2022.\nAmerican workers at Cognizant were twice as likely to be fired or resign than workers on visas, and, \"Black employees were let go at a rate 23 times that of Asian workers.\" According to Bloomberg, \"each of the five largest outsourcing companies has either settled, lost or is currently fighting a discrimination lawsuit\" within the last four years.\" Yet they are allowed to continue petitioning for new workers.\nTheH-1B salary minimumwas set at $60,000 in the 1990s but has not been adjusted for inflation. Employers must attest that they will pay new H-1Bs at least the prevailing wage, but a July 2025 Heritage Foundation report showed most H-1B positions pay below-average salaries.\nMicrosoft reportedly pays 82% of its foreign workers less than the market wage. Accounting giant Deloitte paid H-1B workers 10% less than Americans in similar roles. Many universities use their cap-exempt status to recruit foreign workers over their own graduates.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe most corrupt element in the H-1B pipeline is when they convert to permanent residence. This \"PERM process,\" according to a 2020 Department of Labor report, \"relentlessly has employers not complying with the qualifying criteria\" \u2014 because it is a hoop which they must reluctantly jump through before they can hire their preferred, foreign candidate into a job.\nThe law requires PERMjobsto be advertised, but companies try to hide them. They try to minimally advertise open positions while avoiding qualified American applicants.\nH-1Bs were supposed to be limited to three years, but holders can renew up to six years. And if an alien can\u2019t get a green card because of the cap (no one country is allowed more than 7% of the annual visas), he can get three-year extensions indefinitely.\nIn 2021,Facebook (Meta) was fined $4.75 millionfor intentionally denying qualified U.S. workers a fair opportunity to apply for jobs that it had reserved for H-1Bs. In 2023, Apple paid $25 million for similar discrimination. But these fines are minuscule compared with the profits from bringing in cheap labor.\nIn 2025, a group of veteran tech workers set up the site www.jobs.now. They find deliberately obscure job advertisements and post them, advising applicants to file complaints with the Department of Justice if they believe they were unfairly rejected.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAt a time when 6.1% of recent college graduates with computer science majors are unemployed, allowing thousands of foreign workers to compete against them on unfair terms makes no sense.\nCharging new H-1B petitioners $100,000 will be a body blow to body shops. But it will leave open many other side doors to unfair competition. Let\u2019s hope this is the beginning of more reform to put the H-1B back in its box and give Americans first crack at their own labor market.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SIMON HANKINSON\nSimon Hankinson is a senior research fellow in The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Border Security and Immigration Center and author of\"The Ten Woke Commandments (You Must Not Obey)\"from Academica Books.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/trumps-h-1b-visa-reform-plan-needs-put-americans-first","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":0,"topic_crypto":0}

However, he is earning that title now that his agency is taking on costlyBiden-era car regulationsthat would have disproportionately hurt those most in need of affordable transportation.\nSpecifically, theEPAhas proposed therepeal of new tailpipe standardsthat would have tacked on an agency-estimated $2,100 to the already-rising sticker prices for new gasoline-powered vehicles.

Putting aside the near worship by some of public transit, the reality is that buses and trains can only take you to a subset of the job choices available if you can drive door to door. This is especially true of those who live in relatively poor neighborhoods far from the most promising employers in town. A vehicle also opens up opportunities in the gig economy. Not surprisingly, studies identify vehicle ownership as an important factor in reducing the racial wage gap.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is helping Americans keep their cars affordable.(Getty Images)\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nBut these gains are threatened by rising new car prices, which would only worsen as these Biden-era regulations continue to get more stringent in the years ahead. And used car prices generally rise in tandem with new ones.\nBeyond making vehicles prohibitively expensive for some, higher prices also create financing challenges for others, including reliance on high-interest sub-prime loans. Not surprisingly, vehicle loan delinquency rates are at a 30-year high.\nTRUMP ADMIN EYES OVERTURNING BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY LEGACY TO TUNE OF $7B\nNor are EVs a viable option for those not yet in the middle class.

{"title":"Trump's UN speech reveals inconvenient truth of massive green energy costs","date":1758758400000,"body":"EPA administrator Lee Zeldin joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's remarks on climate change, Hillary Clinton's dismissal of his claims and more.\nAt the Sept. 23,\u00a02025, U.N. General Assembly, PresidentDonald Trumpdrew global headlines by blasting what he called the \"extreme cost\" of thegreen transition,arguing that climate alarmism is impoverishing ordinary people while enriching elites. Whatever one thinks of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, he touched on an inconvenient truth: despite endless assurances from campaigners and institutions like the U.N., World Bank, and World Economic Forum,wind and solarare still not delivering cheap energy. In fact, they are making electricity more expensive.\nFor years, media and green advocates have insisted that solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of electricity. This claim is central to the idea that a green transition is inevitable and beneficial \u2014 even under a second Trump administration. But two decades of evidence shows the opposite. The countries that have added the most solar and wind also have the highest power costs.\nThe claim of \"cheap\" solar and wind is built on a sleight of hand. These sources are indeed often competitive when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. But modern societies need power 24\/7. When the sun is not shining and the wind not blowing, countries must rely on costly backup \u2014 mostly fossil fuels. Factoring in these costs reveals that renewables are far from cheap.\nWORLD LEADERS LAUGH, SQUIRM AS TRUMP BLASTS UN ON CLIMATE, UKRAINE, GAZA AT GENERAL ASSEMBLY\nA\u00a0study of China\u00a0found solar\u2019s real cost was twice that of coal.\u00a0Research about Germany and Texas\u00a0showed that once backup costs are included, solar and wind go from appearing slightly cheaper to many times more expensive.\nPresident Donald Trump delivers remarks to the United Nations General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York City on Sept. 23, 2025. (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY\/AFP via Getty Images)\nWe see this in consumer prices. Germany, Spain, Denmark and the U.K. have some of the world\u2019s highest electricity costs alongside massive investments in renewables. Last year, households and industries in the EU paid more than 26 cents per kilowatt-hour, more than double the U.S. price of 13 cents and triple the price in China. The U.K., with its even greener ambition, paid an eye-watering 36 cents per kilowatt-hour, nearly three times the U.S. price and more than four times the price in China.\nAcross 70 countries, International Energy Agency data shows a clear pattern:\u00a0more renewables, higher costs. Every 10% increase in the share of wind and solar raises average power costs by over four cents per kilowatt-hour.\nHeadlines often tout how Germany and other nations and states generate most of their electricity from renewables. But these stories never mention the dark, windless days when solar and wind provide almost nothing. Last winter, renewables repeatedly delivered less than 4% of Germany\u2019s power for an entire day.\nTRUMP'S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS\nAdvocates say batteries will fix this problem. But all of Germany\u2019s storage would last less than 20 minutes. The reality:fossil fuelsremain essential, but because they now run less frequently, costs soar. Last November, when solar and wind provided almost nothing, wholesale\u00a0German prices spiked to $1 per kilowatt-hour\nAs conventional plants shut down, the risks rise. A German utility CEO\u00a0warned\u00a0the country narrowly avoided blackouts only because the weather wasn\u2019t colder.\nIf solar and wind were truly cheaper, poor countries would leapfrog to them. Yet the opposite is happening. Across developing nations, electricity demand rose almost 5% last year \u2014 mostly met by fossil fuels. China used more additional coal than it used additional solar and wind combined. Bangladesh used 13 times more additional coal than additional renewables.\n'WEB OF DARK MONEY' TIED TO OBAMA, DEMS FUELS GREEN OPPOSITION TO CRUCIAL TRUMP ENERGY PLAN\nIndia, praised for ambitious solar goals, still added three times more coal than solar and wind. Billionaire Gautam Adani, struggling to find buyers for a $6 billion solar project, allegedly resorted to a\u00a0$265 million bribery scheme \u2014 because most Indian states refuse to rely on unreliable renewables.\nPoor nations know reliability matters. Rich nations can indulge the solar-and-wind illusion only because they already have fossil backups and lavish subsidies.\nOn May, 26, 2021, rows of solar panels at the Toms River Solar Farm, which was built on an EPA Superfund site in Toms River, New Jersey.(REUTERS\/Dane Rhys)\nEurope\u2019s high prices at least reflect the true costs of renewables. The U.S. disguises them through subsidies. Federal tax credits for wind and solar alone cost\u00a0nearly $18 billion in 2024, with\u00a0states adding billions more. In Texas alone, total subsidies may have reached nearly $20 billion in 2023 \u2014 10 times the federal subsidies.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAcross the U.S., hidden subsidies may exceed $60 billion annually, meaning real power costs are about 25% higher than official bills suggest.\nGARGANTUAN \u2018BIRD CEMETERIES\u2019 IN BURGUM\u2019S CROSSHAIRS AS DOI LOOKS TO CURB GREEN WIND PROJECTS\nThe myth of cheap renewables is comforting but destructive. It sustains a system of rising bills and endless subsidies, hitting the poorest hardest.\nAdvocates say batteries will fix this problem. But all of Germany\u2019s storage would last less than 20 minutes.\nTrump is right to call out the economic damage of today\u2019s climate policies. But the solution is not to ignoreclimate change\u2014 it is to pursue smarter ones. We should focus on innovation that can genuinely make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels. This means dramatically more investment in research and development: from advanced nuclear to more reliable renewables with storage to geothermal breakthroughs.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSuch investments would cost far less than today\u2019s climate spending and deliver real benefits. Until then, fossil fuels will remain indispensable. Pretending otherwise onlymakes energy more costlyand less secure.\nThe world needs honesty: solar and wind are not yet cheap because they need backup, and forcing them onto power grids only raises prices.

These batteries capture excess energy from the solar panels and release it at night, during cloudy weather, or when demand suddenly rises. The battery system can power about 130,000 homes for up to four hours.\nBy combining solar generation with battery storage, Wisconsin is addressing one of renewable energy's most significant challenges: ensuring a steady and reliable power supply at all times.\nNEW TESLA SOLAR-POWERED CHARGING STATION OPENS\nEnergy useis climbing, and nearly 79 percent of electricity in the United States still comes from fossil fuels. That dependence contributes to increased carbon pollution, higher costs and leaves the grid vulnerable during extreme conditions.\nThe Paris Solar-Battery Park reduces reliance on fossil fuels while strengthening Wisconsin's grid. It also provides a model other states can follow.\nMike Hooper, president of project partner We Energies, called the project\u00a0\"historic\" and stressed that customers can count on dependable and affordable power in any weather. That level of reliability is especially crucial as storms, heatwaves and cold snaps put additional pressure on power systems.\nMassive battery storage units at the Paris Solar-Battery Park capture solar energy for use during nights and peak demand.(We Energies)\nBattery storage is becoming a cornerstone of the clean energy movement. Without storage, solar power only helps while the sun is shining. With it, renewable energy becomes flexible, consistent and available around the clock.\nThis shift benefits both the environment and consumers. Solar farms have been shown to cut electric bills by 5 to 20 percent. Additionally, the Paris Solar-Battery Park is eligible forfederal tax credits, which can pass on savings to residents.\nRecent policy changes may reduce some of those incentives in the future.

In one calculated move, Beijing demonstrated its power to hobble the West.\nThis economic warfare represents decades of strategic planning. While America slept,Chinacornered the market on materials essential to modern civilization. By controlling 90% of rare-earth processing capacity, it dictates prices and decides who receives supplies. The periodic table became their ultimate economic weapon.\nBut weapons can be rendered obsolete through superior innovation.

Aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and defense contractors all discovered their dependence on materials that Beijing could weaponize without warning. This represented the culmination of China's three-decade strategy to corner critical mineral markets while American companies chased quarterly profits and policymakers prioritized cheap consumer goods over strategic independence.\nCHINA'S RARE EARTH TECH OBSESSION ENSNARES US RESIDENT AS CCP LOOKS TO MAINTAIN STRANGLEHOLD\nYet, while China was tightening its grip,American researchersat the University of Minnesota had been solving a puzzle that had frustrated scientists since the 1950s. Professor Jian-Ping Wang spent nearly a decade perfecting techniques to synthesize iron nitride magnets from the most abundant elements on Earth. His breakthrough, published in 2010, finally explained how combining iron with nitrogen can create a material with magnetization exceeding anything China produces from rare earths.\nThe physics is remarkable. Iron nitride retains full magnetization at 200 degrees Celsius, exceeding the temperature capability of all magnet compounds except those made from the scarcest and most expensive critical elements. Most importantly, the raw materials come from sources no nation can monopolize: Minnesota's iron ore deposits and atmospheric nitrogen. Iron nitride represents something China cannot replicate \u2014 American innovation driven by scientific curiosity rather than stateindustrial policy \u2014and reduces ournational securityand economic vulnerabilities while strengthening domestic manufacturing capacity.\nYet commercializing this breakthrough requires the same strategic commitment China demonstrated while building rare-earth dominance.Beijing spent hundreds of billions of dollarsover three decades, accepting losses to achieve market control.

(CMAX)\nA major milestone in construction has arrived. This time from Western Australia. Contec Australia has completed the nation's first multi-story 3D concrete printed home. Located in Tapping near Perth, the two-story residence was finished in just five months. Most impressive? The structural walls were 3D printed in only 18 hours of active printing time.\nThis matters because it points towhere housingmight be heading here, too. With rising costs, labor shortages and a push for more sustainable building methods, this kind of breakthrough could shape the future of American neighborhoods.\nSign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

It demonstrates how 3D concrete printing can bring major benefits to everyday housing. Compared to traditional masonry construction, the Tapping home achieved:\nContec Australia prints the final wall of the second level of a multi-story 3D printed home in Perth.(Contec Australia)\nAnd it doesn't cut corners on durability. The walls are fire-resistant, water-resistant, termite-proof and cyclone rated, features U.S. regions facing hurricanes, floods and wildfires could find especially appealing.\nAMERICA'S LESSONS FROM WORLD\u2019S LARGEST 3D-PRINTED SCHOOLS\nExterior of a multi-story 3D concrete printed home located in Tapping, Australia.(Contec Australia)\nInstead of stacking bricks, Contec's robotic printer extrudes a specialized concrete mix based on a digital 3D model. The mix sets in under three minutes, allowing new layers to be stacked without scaffolding or formwork.\nThe walls are printed in precise layers over the course of 18 hours of active machine time. Once the structural shell is complete, traditional crews step in to add the roof, wiring, windows, flooring and finishing touches.\nWORLD\u2019S BIGGEST 3D-PRINTED SCHOOLS ARE UNDERWAY IN QATAR\nBathroom of a multi-story 3D concrete printed home located in Tapping, Australia.(Contec Australia)\nSpeed:Structural walls finished in 18 hours; full build completed in five months.Cost efficiency:22% cheaper than comparable masonry builds in WA.Design freedom:Complex shapes, curves and openings without added expense.Sustainability:30% lower CO\u2082 emissions than conventional concrete and minimal waste.Durability:More than three times stronger than brick, fire- and water-resistant and able to withstand harsh weather.\nDining room of a multi-story 3D concrete printed home located in Tapping, Australia.(Contec Australia)\nYou may have already heard of Icon, the Texas-based startup that has been pioneering 3D printed homes. Icon's builds include entire neighborhoods of single-story housesin Austin, as well as experimental multi-level projects. However, most of Icon's multi-story designs rely on a hybrid approach, with 3D printing for the ground floor and timber or steel frames for the upper levels.\nThat's what makes the Tapping project stand out. Contec printed the structural walls for both stories in just 18 hours of active printing time, something not yet widely seen in the U.S. This could signal the next step for American 3D printing: scaling beyond single-story housing into more complex multi-story designs.\nBRICKS MADE FROM RECYCLED COFFEE GROUNDS REDUCE EMISSIONS AND COSTS\nBedroom of a multi-story 3D concrete printed home located in Tapping, Australia.(Contec Australia)\nOne of the biggest questions people have is price. Contec hasn't shared the exact cost of the Tapping home, but the company says it delivered the structural walls 22% cheaper than a standard masonry build. That saving adds up when you consider how much of a home's budget goes toward labor and materials.\nIn the U.S., companies like Icon have priced 3D printed homes starting around $100,000 to $150,000, depending on size and finishes. While final costs vary by region, land and design, the potential savings from reduced labor and faster timelines make3D printingan attractive option as housing costs continue to rise.\nVERTICAL TINY HOMES REDEFINE COMPACT LIVING\nKitchen and dining room of a multi-story 3D concrete printed home located in Tapping, Australia.(Contec Australia)\nFor American homeowners, builders and communities, the Tapping project shows how 3D concrete printing could offer faster, cheaper and more resilient housing.

Just as labor markets need unemployment for efficient job matching,\u00a0housing\u00a0markets need vacancies for buyer-seller alignment, renovations and seasonal use.\nActivists say that rate should be 12% instead\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0current 10%, and to hit that target an additional 1 million units are needed. But\u00a0they are cherry-picking\u00a0the\u00a0baseline rate. Census data\u00a0tracked\u00a0since 1965 shows vacancy rates have fluctuated wildly, ranging from 8.3% to 14.5%.\u00a0There\u00a0is\u00a0no stable\u00a0\"natural rate.\"\u00a0Today\u2019s 10% rate falls well within this historical range. When you stop using artificially high assumptions,\u00a0the\u00a0shortage disappears entirely.\nPerhaps anticipating this, activists also argue that demand\u00a0is\u00a0higher than census data shows. First,\u00a0they\u00a0claim\u00a0construction has fallen behind historical trends, from 1.5 million units annually in 1968-2000 to 1.23 million since 2001, creating a cumulative deficit. Second,\u00a0they argue for massive pent-up demand, claiming millions\u00a0of\u00a0people would form separate households if\u00a0housing\u00a0were cheaper, using statistical models to estimate 3-5 million\u00a0\"missing\"\u00a0households.\nHERE'S WHY HELPING THE HOMELESS REBUILD THEIR LIVES IS KEY TO AMERICA\u2019S FUTURE SUCCESS\nBoth arguments assumedemographic conditionsthat no longer exist.\u00a0America\u00a0has transitioned from rapid population growth\u00a0of\u00a0over 1% annually before 2000 to a more stable\u00a00.5%\u00a0today, projected to reach 0.1% by 2055.\u00a0The\u00a0next 30 years will add 23 million people versus 70 million in\u00a0the\u00a0prior 30 years, reflecting lower birth rates and longer lifespans. Deaths will exceed births by 2038 as\u00a0the\u00a0population matures. Meanwhile,\u00a0the\u00a0current administration targets deporting one\u00a0million\u00a0people annually, a figure\u00a0not included\u00a0in Census projections that assumestable immigration.\nLike Birkin bags,\u00a0the\u00a0real\u00a0problem\u00a0isn\u2019t supply, it\u2019s that people want exclusive neighborhoods, and no amount\u00a0of\u00a0construction changes that\u00a0reality. What\u2019s\u00a0really going on here\u00a0is\u00a0that activists are manufacturing a\u00a0housing\u00a0crisis\u00a0in order to impose a\u00a0DEI\u00a0regime on where people choose to live.\nThis\u00a0is\u00a0a corruption\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Fair\u00a0Housing\u00a0Act (FHA), which was focused on equality\u00a0of\u00a0opportunity not results.\u00a0The\u00a0bill did aim to disrupt segregated living patterns but only through\u00a0the\u00a0narrow mechanism\u00a0of\u00a0eliminating overt\u00a0housing\u00a0discrimination.

Instead,\u00a0they want to eliminate disparities in living patterns by lowering community standards through government coercion.\u00a0Their chief target\u00a0is\u00a0local zoning laws, which serve\u00a0the\u00a0important function\u00a0of\u00a0maintaining community character. It\u2019s why Washington,\u00a0D.C., which bans skyscrapers, doesn\u2019t look like Manhattan.\nNew York City\u2019s Economic Development Corporation exemplifies this approach, scolding neighborhoods like\u00a0the\u00a0Upper East Side, SoHo and\u00a0the\u00a0West Village for\u00a0\"restrictive\u00a0land use regulations\"\u00a0that limit density.\u00a0They explicitly note that\u00a0\"Community Districts producing\u00a0the\u00a0least affordable\u00a0housing\u00a0are disproportionately white.\"\u00a0Their demographic focus reveals\u00a0the\u00a0true agenda.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe\u00a0Obama administration weaponized this logic through HUD\u2019s Affirmatively Furthering Fair\u00a0Housing\u00a0rule, forcing towns that accepted federal funding to eliminate zoning laws and to provide detailed reports on racial demographics.\u00a0The\u00a0effort had an important political dimension. By forcing high-density, low-income\u00a0housing\u00a0into suburban communities, activists aimed to flip red areas blue.\nPresident Trump recognized\u00a0the\u00a0stakes in his first term, and tasked a White House team led by John McEntee to eliminate\u00a0the\u00a0rule, which\u00a0they did in\u00a014 days. Biden reinstated it, but HUD SecretaryScott Turnerwisely eliminated it again soon after taking\u00a0office.\nUnfortunately, some Republicans and Libertarians have fallen for\u00a0the\u00a0housing\u00a0shortage hoax and still don\u2019t\u00a0realize that eliminating sensible neighborhood standards like zoning are a stalking horse for imposing\u00a0DEI\u00a0quotas.

But that show of force is not the only threat posed by today\u2019s axis of evil.\nEqually alarming is the insidious attack by China and its allies on theU.S. dollar, ringing alarms across global financial markets. China and other central banks have been stockpiling gold, diversifying their reserves away from U.S. government bonds, driving gold prices higher and Treasury yields up. Their allies have followed suit.\nDoes it matter to most Americans? Yes. A weaker dollar means traveling abroad and imported goods are more expensive, even without tariffs. Higher interest rates inflate borrowing costs.\nGOLD MIGHT GLITTER, BUT IT'S STILL MONEY. TAXES SHOULD TREAT IT THAT WAY\nMorgan Stanley reports, \"The value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies dropped about 11% in the first half of this year, the biggest decline in more than 50 years, ending a 15-year bull cycle.\" The investment bank, writing last month, also noted that, \"The U.S. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973,\" and predicts more deterioration over the next 12 months.\nWhile the dollar has been dropping, gold prices have surged. The Comex price for September delivery recently topped $3,600 per ounce, an all-time high. The price is up 45% over the past year.\nIn June, J.P. Morgan analysts predicted that gold prices would move higher in large part because of continued purchases by central banks. They wrote, \"Gold holdings by central banks amount to nearly 36,200 tonnes and account for almost 20% of official reserves, up from around 15% at the end of 2023, according to reported IMF data through the end of 2024.\"\nCHINA'S CENTRAL BANK CALLS ON STATE BANKS TO REDUCE US DOLLAR PURCHASES\n\"Diversification away from U.S. dollar reserve holdings, while still moderate, has been accelerating in recent years\u2026 The U.S. dollar share ended the year at around 57.8%, marking a 0.62 percentage point decline.\"\nNot all central banks have participated in the recent gold-buying spree. J.P. Morgan cited China, Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan, Czechia and Iraq as the main players \u2014 not exactly a Who\u2019s Who of U.S. allies.\nInvestors, too, have bought gold, especially in China. \"ETF inflows have sharply gained momentum, with year-to-date total inflows amounting to 310 tonnes \u2014 translating to around 10% in total global holdings. This has been fueled largely by a 9.5% increase in U.S. holdings and a 70% increase in Chinese ETF holdings.\"\nWhy isChinaditching dollars and buying gold?

From the Federal Reserve to trade policy to deportations of illegal immigrants, here's a look at the high-stakes legal showdowns shaping Trump\u2019s week.\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, aBidenappointee, signaled on Friday she will seek to rule quickly on whether Trump acted unlawfully in moving to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations. She didn\u2019t make a rulingduring the two-hour hearingbut told both sides to submit more filings by Sept 2.

Her lawsuit names as defendants Trump, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Reserve ChairmanJerome Powell.\nIt is not clear if Cook has attempted to enter the Federal Reserve's main headquarters in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood in D.C. since Trump's letter terminating her. TheFederal Reservedeclined to say whether Cook has tried to work from her office, is working remotely, or retains access to the email and other resources she needs for her job.\nBefore Cook filed her suit, a Fed spokesperson acknowledged the potential legal feud and wrote in an Aug. 26 statement that the Fed will \"abide by any court decision.\"\nCOOK\u2019S POTENTIAL EXIT HANDS TRUMP GREATER SWAY OVER FED BOARD SHAPING US MONETARY POLICY\nIn a different legal case, Judge Cobb issued a temporary order preventing the Trump administration from carrying out expedited deportations of illegal immigrants. The policy would have allowed some to be deported without first going before an immigration judge.\nIn an Aug. 29 opinion, Cobb ruled that the Trump administration\u2019s plan to quickly deportillegal immigrantswho had lived in the U.S. less than two years violated their right to due process.\n\"In defending this skimpy process, the government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment,\" Cobb wrote, adding that the government could accuse \"not only noncitizens, but everyone.\"\n\"The government could accuse you of entering unlawfully, relegate you to a bare-bones proceeding where it would \u2018prove\u2019 your unlawful entry, and then immediately remove you,\" Cobb added.\nFEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S EXPANDED DEPORTATION PLAN OVER DUE PROCESS CONCERNS\nMeanwhile, on the trade front, a federal appeals court said on Friday that Trump overstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose newtariffson imported goods.\nThe court said that power lies squarely with Congress or within existing trade policy frameworks.

They\u2019ve paved roads, built bridges and raised the skyscrapers that shape our landscape. Their tireless efforts continue to drive progress and prosperity.\nThis Labor Day, we celebrate theAmerican workerswho took a vast expanse of new frontier and carved a path for communities and industries to thrive. For two and a half centuries, these laborers have sustained our businesses and maintained the very basis of our success: the family.\nAs a mom of twin girls and a new grandmother, I understand that the reason behind our 9-to-5 is the people we gather with around the kitchen table. Our wage earners aren\u2019t just punching the clock to stay busy. Their work has a purpose: supporting the next generation.\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at the U.S. Steel Mon Valley Works-Irvin Plant, May 30, 2025, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania.(AP Photo\/David Dermer)\nThat\u2019s why we applaud the work ethic and pride that the American worker applies to their job, because they\u2019re not just growing the economy \u2013 they are proving the American Dream is alive and well for future generations.\nTRUMP\u2019S \u2018ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL\u2019 COULD CEMENT ECONOMIC LEGACY FOR DECADES\nAt the Department of Labor, we are going to keep our foot on the gas, accelerating into the Golden Age of America. Prosperity is on the horizon, with real median weekly earnings at their highest level since the last time PresidentDonald Trumpwas in office.\nWe are doing what it takes to ensure that as new, mortgage-paying jobs are being created, skilled workers are ready and able to fill them. Putting native-born workers first in that effort, we\u2019ve already witnessed an increase in native-born employment by 2,462,000 since January.\nTo keep driving this progress, President Trump tasked the Labor Department with a mission to Make America Skilled Again. That\u2019s the drum I\u2019m going to keep beating. It will require time and effort, but it\u2019s going to yield dividends for our workers and their families.\nAs we create new opportunities for theAmerican worker, I\u2019ve been on the ground, talking to folks around the country whose lives inform our policies. I\u2019m finding out what they need at the federal level and how we can best serve them in Washington.\nARE PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S TARIFFS ACTUALLY WORKING?\nI\u2019m over halfway through my 50-state America at Work tour, and a recurring theme has been workforce readiness \u2013 ensuring our labor force is prepared and trained for the challenges of tomorrow. From decades of political neglect, the American worker was placed on the back burner and their best interests were ignored.\nNow, the Trump administration is turning that around, placing our workers at the pinnacle of oureconomic vision. We\u2019re reigniting the Made in America spirit that defined the founding of our country.\nAt a little over 200 days into President Trump\u2019s incredible second term, we\u2019ve seen the economy rapidly responding to better trade deals and sound labor policy \u2013 especially in the private sector. There has been more than $8 trillion in domestic investments, which led to half a million private sector jobs being created since Inauguration Day.\nBlue-collar wages have also increased 1.4% over last year \u2013 the second-fastest increase for the start of a new term on record. Even better, instead of inflation outpacing wages, as it did underPresident Joe Bidenfor 26 straight months, real wages have increased every single month since President Trump returned to office.\nTRUMP'S MAJOR TRADE WINS COULD BE ROCKET FUEL TO US ECONOMY\nAnd we\u2019re just getting started.\nWith this expectation-shattering job and wage growth, I\u2019m teaming up with my colleagues across the administration to keep the red-hot economy going strong. The Departments ofLabor, Commerce and Educationjoined together to create a five-pillar plan called America\u2019s Talent Strategy. This comprehensive strategy will help us expand access to good-paying jobs, build skilled talent pipelines for critical industries, equip the workforce with artificial intelligence skills, and reposition the U.S. as the global economic leader.\nTo bring further relief to hardworking families, I\u2019m determined to get heavy-handed government out of their pockets. At the Department of Labor, we announced a historic 63 deregulatory actions to do just that. We\u2019re slashing red tape and making it easier for workers to keep more of their hard-earned money.\nMy team also announced $30 million in grant opportunities through the Industry-Driven Skills Training Fund. This money is going to accelerate workforce innovation and address critical labor needs across the country, giving a financial boost right to the people who need it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' WILL UNLEASH PARALLEL PROSPERITY\nWhat\u2019s more, our future will not be forged in the halls of woke universities, but by the grit of skilled workers, so I\u2019m coordinating with the Department of Education and working with states to expose even more students to the trades and provide a springboard into the workforce that doesn\u2019t rely on a traditional four-year degree. Trade school enrollment has already reached the highest level ever recorded, and we\u2019re going to make sure it keeps going up.\nIn keeping with these goals, the president signed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, expanding Pell Grants to students pursuing technical education and skills training. Not only is this law of the land going to unlock even more opportunities for future tradesmen and women, but it will also add thousands of dollars to every single worker\u2019s paycheck through historic tax cuts.\nBetween the unlocked Pell Grant opportunities and the president\u2019s directive to recruit more apprentices, it\u2019s crystal clear \u2013 we\u2019re on our way to creating one million new active apprenticeships nationwide. Since January alone, the Department of Labor recorded 1,736 new registered apprenticeship programs launched nationally and over 183,000 new apprentices.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nOn this Labor Day, and every day, we recognize the impact of our apprentices, tradesmen, blue collar workers and small business owners. And there\u2019s plenty to look forward to as the Department of Labor launches our officialcelebration of the 250th birthdayof our great nation.\nWith President Trump leading the way as the most pro-worker president in generations, labor will remain at the forefront of our America First agenda.

But this year, in the wake of growing\u00a0economic inequality\u00a0and a\u00a0government increasingly catering to billionaires and special interests,\u00a0Labor\u00a0Day\u00a0needs to be more than a long holiday weekend. It must be the impetus of a battle cry\u00a0for\u00a0workers everywhere to rise up, realize their collective strength and take their\u00a0power\u00a0back.\nHedge fund managers and tech moguls did not build this country or the American middle class. It was technicians, engineers, installers, teachers, caregivers, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, ironworkers, painters,\u00a0laborers, operators, mechanics, drivers, farmworkers, clerks, grocers and so many others.\nThey went to work each\u00a0day\u00a0\u2013 often invisible and without fair pay, benefits, or even basic dignity. They risked their jobs, their safety and sometimes their lives tosecure better working conditionswe all enjoy today, like an eight-hour workday, overtime pay and the right to organize.\nA sign at a May Day rally for worker and immigrant rights at the Capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota. (Michael Siluk\/UCG\/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\nI\u2019ve spent my career enforcing\u00a0labor\u00a0law and fighting to protect\u00a0workers\u2019 rights. I\u2019ve seen how\u00a0powerful working people can be when they come together. The bosses and billionaires see it, too \u2013 and it terrifies them. That\u2019s why they\u2019re working hard in Washington to rig the system, spending millions to weaken\u00a0worker\u00a0protections and make it harder\u00a0for\u00a0workers to exercise their rights to unionize, collectively bargain and mobilize to improve their working conditions, and to enjoy their freedoms of speech, assembly, association and expression.\nARE YOU BETTER OFF SINCE DONALD TRUMP TOOK OFFICE?\nToday, we\u2019re living through one of the largest transfers of wealth in modern history. Working people andfamilies juggle multiple jobswhile corporations pop champagne over record profits and billionaires buy second yachts.\u00a0Recent estimates\u00a0show the Republican budget bill will only deepen this disparity, by taking away Medicaid and SNAP assistance from millions of Americans to pay\u00a0for\u00a0tax cuts\u00a0for\u00a0the super wealthy that they really don\u2019t need and didn\u2019t earn. They\u2019re profiting off the backs of so many hard-working people.\nThis is not an accident. It\u2019s the direct result of a system where corporations and their donors have an\u00a0outsized voice and direct influence on our democracy\u00a0\u2013 and politicians showering them with loopholes and special treatment.\u00a0For\u00a0example, President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0Labor\u00a0Department\u00a0recently announced\u00a0they were rolling back 60 workplace regulations, putting\u00a0workers at greater risk of being hurt while making it easier\u00a0for\u00a0employers to get away with it.\nSimilarly, the National\u00a0Labor\u00a0Relations Board (NLRB)\u00a0remains without a quorum, rendering it impossible to issue rulings or make decisions that hold corporations accountable\u00a0for\u00a0breaking the law. My fear is that, if this continues, we\u2019ll find ourselves living in an environment reflective of what it was like before 1935\u2019s National\u00a0Labor\u00a0Relations Act: lower wages, substandard working conditions and no real channels\u00a0for\u00a0workers to fight back.\nDON'T BE FOOLED. MAMDANI ISN'T THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THESE TWO PATRIOTIC WOMEN ARE\nBillionaires and corporations hope this will make\u00a0workers feel defeated. We can\u2019t let that happen because the truth is \u2013\u00a0workers aren\u2019t\u00a0powerless. To the contrary, they have tremendous\u00a0power.\nLet\u2019s remember our history. From the Boston Tea Party to women\u2019s suffrage to the Civil Rights Movement to the strikes at the turn of the 20th century,\u00a0workers have always been a catalyst\u00a0for\u00a0change. Protests, boycotts, picketing, strikes, sit-ins, non-cooperation \u2013 these have never been signs of violence or dysfunction. They\u2019reexpressions of democracy.\nOur present moment in history is no different \u2013 and\u00a0workers must realize they have tools to begin reclaiming this country and their\u00a0power\u00a0to demand changes to the way they\u2019re governed and how they live their lives.\nWE HAVE A GOVERNMENT OF BILLIONAIRES, BY BILLIONAIRES AND FOR BILLIONAIRES\nSupport\u00a0for\u00a0unions\u00a0has skyrocketed to its highest point in generations, especially\u00a0among young people. They\u2019re organizing at coffee shops, warehouses, grocery stores, newspapers, universities, airlines, hospitals, tech campuses and many other locations because they realize the\u00a0power\u00a0they hold through standing together and bargaining collectively.\nThey\u2019re rightfully demanding more than just survival \u2013 they\u2019re demanding respect. They\u2019re standing strong in the face of union-busting campaigns, retaliatory firings and illegal threats because they know what\u2019s at stake \u2013 not just\u00a0for\u00a0themselves, but\u00a0for\u00a0their families and their communities. There\u2019s strength in numbers.\nThat\u2019s what gives me hope because collective\u00a0power\u00a0is stronger than individual\u00a0power. We\u2019re seeing agroundswell of organizingin places once thought impossible to organize, especially when people feel their elected representatives aren\u2019t listening to them. This creates enormous opportunities\u00a0for\u00a0unions, advocates and allies to rally around\u00a0workers, listen to their challenges, and build grassroots momentum to help\u00a0workers obtain a more level playing field and safer, more just and inclusive workplaces.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIn my experience, billionaires and corporations don\u2019t provide\u00a0workers with a fair and equitable workplace through an act of goodwill. They will provide it, however, when\u00a0workers demand it loudly, boldly, and persistently and show their collective\u00a0power. This means withholding\u00a0labor, engaging in non-cooperation, organizing sit-ins and taking other\u00a0forms of collective action. It\u2019s time\u00a0for\u00a0workers to use this\u00a0power\u00a0to protest about injustices and inequities, to make sure laws are fully enforced, and to vote out elected officials\u00a0for\u00a0not representing their interests.\nLabor\u00a0Day\u00a0was bornout of strikes and marches from those who came before us.

Scott Wiener and Los Angeles Councilmember Imelda Padilla debated on the \"Pod Save America\" podcast about how California should handle its ongoing housing crisis. Wiener\u2019s Abundant & Affordable Homes Near Transit Act, SB 79,according to his press release,\"tackles the root causes of California\u2019s affordability crisis by allowing more homes to be built near major public transportation stops and on land owned by transit agencies, bolstering transit use, slashing climate emissions, and supporting public transportation in the process.\"\nOpponents of such legislation argue that introducing large amounts of affordable housing threatens to irreversibly change the character of their local neighborhoods.Padilla said on the podcastthat a top responsibility of a council member is making land-use decisions that greatly impact the lives of constituents.\n\"People get elected for the conversations that they have with folks about what they're going to do to keep their neighborhood looking and growing the way that they want it to be,\" she said.\nNEW GOP BILL WOULD CUT OFF HOUSING FUNDS TO SANCTUARY CITIES DEFYING TRUMP DHS\nFrom left, Scott Wiener, Jon Lovett, and Imelda Padilla debated California's housing crisis.(Pod Save America)\nShe added, \"So, for example, for the state to say, \u2018Here's your opportunity to build something that is potentially seven stories high when nothing around it is seven stories because the state allows it,\u2019 it's almost an insult to everyone who voted for the individual who they believe is going to help grow and clean and maintain their communities as they would like them to be.\"\n\"But see, that to me gets to the core of the issue,\" Lovett responded.\n\"I really want to be fair to your point of view,\" he continued. \"But what I hear there, is what you're saying is, \u2018Well, there weren't seven-story buildings here in the past, so there can't be seven-story buildings here in the future.'

She argued the compromise, designed to look better, would be preferable to a \"big ugly cement box in the middle of the neighborhood\" that would maximize density at all costs.\n\"Do you really think that all these young people that are seeking the Hollywood jobs that want to come to Los Angeles, want to live in a cement-looking building and find it to be dignified?\" she asked. \"I don't think so.

If you're one of them, then therecent study by Microsoftwill shed some light on how AI's generative capabilities will impact your field of work. In short, some occupations are more susceptible to its influence than others.\nThis study is making waves because, unlike previous studies, it draws insight from real-world data. Microsoft looked at 200,000 anonymous Copilot conversations from 2024 and mapped them against the U.S. government's job classification system.\nThe study also identified entire occupational groups, like \"computer and mathematical occupations\" and \"office and administrative support,\" among those with the highest AI overlap.

Positions like advertising sales agents and market research analysts face the greatest likelihood of AI integration, according to a recent Microsoft study.(Ivan Alvarado)\nThe result of the study was the calculation of an \"AI applicability score.\" It measures how closely certain job activities align with the capabilities of AI. To no one's surprise, knowledge-based and communication-heavy roles were at the top of thelist of jobsthat are most impacted. At the bottom of this list were jobs requiring physical labor or machine operation, showing minimal overlap.\nThis score reflects overlap, not guaranteed job loss. The researchers stressed that no occupation is fully performed by AI. The study focuses only on language-based generative AI (like Copilot), not other AI areas such as robotics or autonomous systems, which could affect different roles.\nHOLLYWOOD TURNS TO AI TOOLS TO REWIRE MOVIE MAGIC\nThe researchers emphasized that it's important to differentiate between overlap and replacement. Overlap means theAI performscertain tasks alongside humans, while replacement means it will take their place. The study makes no predictions about job growth or losses. It's simply a snapshot of where AI fits in today. In fact, historical trends suggest that automation can sometimes add jobs instead of taking them away. So, it's not all gloom and doom even in sectors with high overlap.\nTwo men give a presentation at a meeting on data and AI integration.

It means AI is already capable of handling parts of your daily tasks \u2014 and that can be an opportunity if you learn to use it. Those who embrace AI tools now can work faster, free up time for creative thinking, and make themselves even more valuable.\nIf your role is on the \"least impacted\" list, don't assume you're immune forever. While physical and hands-on jobs have less overlap with AI today,future technologiesbeyond language models, like robotics or AI-driven machinery, could change that picture. Staying adaptable, learning basic AI skills, and keeping up with tech trends will help you stay ahead no matter your industry.\nIn short, treat this study as a career weather forecast, not a doomsday prediction. AI might not replace you, but someone who knows how to work with AI could. The smartest move?

The White House teased that Trump would make a major announcement on Wednesday, which ultimately revealed Apple had increased its U.S. investment commitment by $100 billion to $600 billion.\n\"Today Apple is announcing that it will invest $600 billion \u2014 that's with a B \u2014 in the United States over the next four years.

The tariff hikes followed months of the U.S. and India holding trade negotiations that appeared to be all but solidified in July, but fell to pieces by August.\n\"Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because theirTariffs are far too high,among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country,\" Trump wrote on social media on Wednesday.\nTRUMP CELEBRATES 6 MONTHS BACK IN OFFICE: US 'TOTALLY REVIVED' AFTER BEING 'DEAD' UNDER BIDEN\n\"Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipmentfrom Russia, and are Russia\u2019s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE \u2014 ALL THINGS NOT GOOD!

Companies \"building in the United States,\" however, will be exempt from the tariffs, he said.\n\"100 percent tariff on all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States, but if you've made a commitment to build, or if you're in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff,\" he said on Wednesday.\nPresident Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, Aug, 15.(Reuters)\nTrump wrapped up the working week by holding a trilateral meeting with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to sign a peace agreement after the two nations have battled one another since the 1980s over a territorial conflict.\nThe White House said Friday that the two nations agreed to build a road connecting Azerbaijan and an autonomous enclave currently separated by Armenian territory.

USPS lost $94 billion between 2007 and 2020. The agency carries more than $188 billion in liabilities and unfunded obligations. Meanwhile, private carriers like FedEx and UPS are thriving, innovating and investing in automation while USPS remains bloated, bureaucratic and bogged down by outdated infrastructure and a labor force that\u2019s nearly impossible to reform due to union pressure and congressional meddling.\nTHE FED\u2019S FOOLISH INTEREST RATE POLICY IS STOPPING AMERICA\u2019S ECONOMY FROM BOOMING\nSome will say, \"But, Ted, thePostal Serviceprovides a vital public good.

While USPS has been hemorrhaging money and shedding mail volume, it\u2019s also spending millions on failed pilot programs like banking services, Sunday deliveries that no one asked for, and electric vehicles that sound great in a press release but cost taxpayers far more than the savings they\u2019ll ever bring.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe postmaster general has already warned thatmore price hikesare coming.

The historic trade deals and peace deals he secured on behalf of the American people made President Trump\u2019s second 100 days just as successful as the first.\"\nTrump hit his 100th day of his second administration in April, which included operating at warp speed as Trump signed dozens of executive orders, leveled harsh tariffs on foreign nations to bring parity to the U.S.' trade deficit, negotiated with foreign nations to work to end wars, unveiled the Department of Government Effeciency to investigate the federal government for potential mismanagement and fraud, locked down the U.S. border with Mexico and continued an overhaul of the federal government so it falls in line with the admin's \"America First\" policies.\nThe first 100 days of a new administration commonly has been viewed as a symbolic benchmark to measure a president's early successes.

It also rescinds certain Biden-era green energy tax credits, allocates approximately $350 billion for defense and Trump\u2019s mass deportation efforts and institutes Medicaid reforms.\n\"We have officially made the Trump tax cuts permanent,\" Trump said during the July signing ceremony. \"That's the largest tax cut in the history of our country. . . . \u00a0After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship economically. We've delivered no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors. It makes the child tax credit permanent for 40 million American families.

Energy companies in the past 100 days have pledged billions to upgrade nuclear plants and modernize gas pipelines, while the administration celebrated the July opening of the newest coal plant in Wyoming in decades, as well as Trump signing a multidecade agreement to increase natural gas exports\u00a0to Europe.\nOn the domestic political front, the Trump administration has also championed uncovering and releasing further details surrounding theRussian collusion hoaxthat plagued Trump's 2016 presidential win and first presidency.\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard released bombshell unclassified documents in July that reportedly show \"overwhelming evidence\" that then-President Barack Obama and his national security team allegedly laid the groundwork for what would be the yearslong Trump\u2013Russia collusion probe after Trump's election win against former Secretary of StateHillary Clintonin 2016.\nFOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM\n\"The implications of this are frankly nothing short of historic,\" Gabbard told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in July.\n\"Over 100 documents that we released on Friday really detail and provide evidence of how this treasonous conspiracy was directed by President Obama just weeks before he was due to leave office after President Trump had already gotten elected,\" she continued. \"This is not a Democrat or Republican issue. This is an issue that is so serious it should concern every single American, because it has to do with the integrity of our democratic republic.\"\nAttorney GeneralPam Bondidirected the DOJ to act on the criminal referral Gabbard sent in July over the matter.

Our military systems\u2014from aircraft and submarines to advanced weaponry\u2014rely heavily on copper, as do essential civilian sectors, including the electrical grid, telecommunications networks, and cutting-edge manufacturing.\nDespite copper\u2019s strategic importance, America\u2019s copper industry continues to behollowed outby unfair foreign trade practices\u2014including state-subsidized overcapacity and below-cost dumping by countries like China, Vietnam, and India to export manipulation and predatory pricing by countries like Chile, Peru, and Mexico. These practices, often violating WTO rules, depress global copper prices and discourage investment in domestic smelting and refining facilities. Combined with burdensome domestic regulations, this has left America dangerously reliant on foreign sources for a metal critical to our defense and economic security.\nMORNING GLORY: PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE UNITED STATES\u2019 MASSIVE TARIFF HAUL IN HIS FIRST SIX MONTHS BACK\nOnce a global leader in copper mining, refining, and manufacturing, the U.S. now faces a perilous dependence on imports. Our refining capacity alone has declined by 56 percent since the late 1990s, forcing us into the absurd position of exporting raw copper ore and scrap overseas, only to re-import finished products. This isn\u2019t merely inefficient\u2014it\u2019s strategically reckless.\nThe trade deficit in copper-intensive downstream products underscores our vulnerability. Between 2010 and 2024, this deficit surged from $4.8 billion to a staggering $19.4 billion, a 302 percent increase. Last year alone, America imported nearly a million metric tons of refined copper to meet basic domestic needs. Every pound of copper imported is a pound we could and should be processing right here at home, creating American jobs andsecuring our supply chains.\nThis troubling dependence is compounded by global overcapacity in copper refining, predominantly fueled by state-subsidized overproduction abroad. The result? America has become dangerously reliant on foreign sources for a metal integral to our defense and economic security.\nTo address this threat, President Trump, acting decisively under Section 232 authority, has imposed tariffs designed to rebuild and safeguard America\u2019s copper supply chains. Specifically, the President is implementing an immediate 50 percent tariff on imported semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products. Additionally, refined copper imports will face a phased tariff\u2014starting at 15 percent in 2027 and increasing to 30 percent in 2028. These measured steps will provide critical breathing room for U.S. companies to ramp up domestic refining and processing capabilities.\nTrump Tariff \"panicans\" will inevitably complain about costs and economic disruption. But let\u2019s be clear: these tariffs represent amodest and necessary premiumcompared to the enormous risks posed by continued dependence on foreign copper.\nWe've learned from prior Section 232 actions on steel and aluminum that tariffs can successfully revitalize critical industries. Those actions attracted billions of dollars in new investment, restored domestic capacity, created thousands of jobs, and secured crucial materials for our military and infrastructure.\nThe tariffs on copper will yield similar results. They will catalyze the revival of domestic refining and smelting capabilities, incentivize investment in new technologies, and put Americans back to work in states across our great land producing the copper we desperately need.\nThe United States holds abundant copper reserves\u2014enough to fully meet domestic demand for approximately 40 years. Arizona alone hosts some of the country's largest deposits, including the Morenci mine, one of North America's most productive copper sources.\nRevitalizing America\u2019s copper industry means revitalizing American communities. From copper mines in Arizona and Montana to smelters and processing plants in Utah, Texas, and Indiana, these tariffs will help create thousands of high-paying, blue-collar jobs.

As I'm going to talk about in this segment, I can't think of a more influential president during this century, and it starts here with tariffs.

The decision is\u00a0extremely foolish.\nBy keeping rates at a comparatively high level, relative to the average rate over the past two decades, the Fed is unnecessarily suppressingeconomic growthand making it harder for consumers and businesses to finance debt. Moreover, the unemployment rate rose in July to 4.2%, marking an uptick from June and underscoring that the labor market is cooling, and the economy is in need of support.\nThe federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to each other overnight \u2014 is a powerful tool used by the Federal Reserve to influence U.S. economic activity. Changes to this rate ripple throughout the economy, affecting borrowing costs, consumer behavior, and, ultimately, the broader business cycle.\nBACK FROM SCOTLAND, TRUMP ENTERS CRUCIAL TRADE WEEK AND EYES FED'S DECISION ON RATE CUTS\nHigher rates mean it becomes more expensive for banks to borrow money overnight. This cost is often passed on to consumers and businesses through higher interest rates on loans and credit.\nCritics are calling out Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates. FILE: Powell testifies during a House Oversight and Reform Select Subcommittee hearing on the Coronavirus crisis, on Capitol Hill in Washington, June 22, 2021.(Graeme Jennings\/Pool via REUTERS)\nWhen the Fed lowers the funds rate, borrowing becomes cheaper, and this generally stimulates more economic activity.\nMost analysts believe that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to keep interest rates high, relative to the average rate over the past 15 years, is being driven by fear.Fed Chairman Jerome Powelland some of the other leaders at the central bank say that if they lower interest rates,inflationwill surge, driving up already high costs on goods and services across the economy.\nGOOD ECONOMIC DATA IS BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP\u2019S INTEREST RATE PUSH\nHowever, the best evidence tells a very different story.\nFirst of all, there currently is no inflation crisis.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in July that the consumer price index \u2014 one of the most popular measures of inflation \u2014 increased in June by 2.7% compared to one year prior.\nAlthough the CPI in June was slightly higher than the CPI recorded in May (2.4%), both months remained below the levels recorded in December 2024 (2.9%) and January 2025 (3%). Additionally, inflation has leveled off substantially from where it was during much ofJoeBiden\u2019spresidency.\nSecond, historical data and recent experience show that the Fed\u2019s view of inflation and interest rates is completely misguided. The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate is not a significant factor in causing or preventing inflation.\nTRUMP\u2019S HOUSING CHIEF RIPS POWELL FOR BLOWING MILLIONS ON FED FACELIFT DURING HOUSING CRISIS HE PERPETUATES\nFor example, during President Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in office, the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate was extremely low,\u00a0consistently less than 1%. Yet,\u00a0inflation was also extremely low, even during years in which the economy added a significant number of jobs.\nMost analysts believe that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to keep interest rates high, relative to the average rate over the past 15 years, is being driven by fear.\nNotably, during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates substantially \u2014 though not nearly as high as they are now \u2014 and inflation remained relatively the same as it had been under much of Obama\u2019s term.\nThese are not exceptions to the rule. A review of data over the past half-century shows there\u2019s no strong correlation between the Fed\u2019s interest rate and inflation.\nFEDERAL RESERVE LEAVES INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED\nThat doesn\u2019t mean interest rates are irrelevant, or that they should be at or near zero. Keeping interest rates too low over a long period can create significant unintended consequences, such as encouraging increases in public and private debt. But the idea that Powell and his pals at the Fed are staving off an inflation crisis by keeping rates high is delusional.\nAll that the Fed is achieving by refusing to cut rates \u2014 even by just half a percentage point \u2014 is making it costlier for everyone to finance debt. This has enormous economic implications, especially for businesses wanting to expand and families looking to buy or sell a home, car, or another high-priced item.\nThe Federal Reserve hasn't treated former President Joe Biden and President Trump's economies the same.(Getty Images)\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates high is, by design, keeping America\u2019s economy from booming.\nIf the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate isn\u2019t the most important factor when considering inflation, then what is? The answer is, it all depends on the circumstances.\nSEN RAND PAUL: THERE ARE $186 BILLION REASONS WHY WE MUST AUDIT THE FED\nInflation occurs when the prices of goods and services across the economy rise, making your money worth less than it was before. One common cause is when people are spending a lot and demand for things like food, housing, or cars increases faster than companies can supply them. When this happens, businesses often raise prices because they know customers are willing to pay more.\nAnother cause is when it becomes more expensive for businesses to produce goods. If wages go up, raw materials cost more, or energy becomes pricier, companies may pass those extra costs on to consumers by raising prices.\nInflation can also happen when there\u2019s a large increase in the amount of money circulating in the economy. If the government prints a lot of money or spends heavily without matching production, the value of money can fall. When each dollar buys less than before, prices rise to make up the difference.\nTRUMP IS CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE FED IS MANAGED MORE THAN ABOUT FIRING POWELL, SAYS DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF\nDuring the Biden presidency, all these things occurred. Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress spent obscene amounts of money, imposed policies that sent energy prices skyrocketing, increased regulatory burdens on businesses, and discouraged people from working by hooking millions on government programs.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAdditionally, COVID-19 lockdowns, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East raised uncertainty and, in some cases, severely impacted supply chains, raising prices on a long list of goods and services.\nBut now, the lockdowns are over, supply chains and markets have adjusted to the recent international turmoil, investment in America is on rise, and people are back to work.\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates high is, by design, keeping America\u2019s economy from booming.\nThere\u2019s simply no reason to believe that a modest interest rate cut would cause inflation to increase dramatically, if at all.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhy, then, are Powell and the other Fed governors keeping rates higher than needed? Perhaps it\u2019s because they don\u2019t like the president. Or maybe it\u2019s because they don\u2019t understand what truly causes inflation.\nEither way, it seems apparent that a change in leadership is desperately needed at America\u2019s central bank.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINS\nJustin Haskins is a New York Times bestselling author and a senior fellow at The Heartland Institute and Our Republic.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/feds-foolish-interest-rate-policy-stopping-americas-economy-from-booming","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

Jason Crow, D-Colo., joined 'MediaBuzz' to discuss why the Democratic Party's approval is dwindling as it struggles to identify a new strategy.\nGen Z is on the verge of opting out. Not out of laziness \u2014 out of disillusionment. We\u2019ve inherited a roadmap that no longer leads anywhere, and for many of us, the American Dream feels more like a bedtime story than a blueprint for life.\nI know this because I almost walked away from it too. But I didn\u2019t. And now I\u2019m building the tools to make sure others don\u2019t have to.\nI\u2019m 23 years old, a first-generation American. My parents came here fromChinain the late \u201990s, carrying little more than hope and an oversized suitcase. They believed \u2014 maybe more than anything \u2014 that hard work meant opportunity. They didn\u2019t have much, but they had that belief. And through discipline and what I now recognize as unimaginable sacrifice, they carved out a life that gave me the freedom to dream bigger than they ever could.\nTHE AMERICAN DREAM SLIPS FURTHER AWAY AS YOUNGER ADULTS RETREAT TO PARENTS' HOMES\nThat dream led me to pave my own way. I started investing in 2nd grade with a custodian account I begged my parents to open. I dropped out of high school to build and sell my first company, a virtual reality startup.\nI then found myself starting Harvard at the height of the pandemic. From my dorm room, I participated in theCOVID investing boom-- memestocks, crypto, super-star fund managers\u2026 I embraced it all. And the eventual collapse of the mania inspired me to take action. I dropped out to builddub, a fintech platform to help all Americans invest with more clarity and confidence.\nIn many ways, I\u2019m living proof that the American Dream is still possible. But I know I\u2019m an outlier. And unless we make bold changes \u2014 fast \u2014 my generation will stop believing it\u2019s even worth trying.\nWe recently partnered with Harris Poll to ask Americans how they really feel about their financial future. What we found is sobering.Sixty percentof Gen Z no longer believe a traditional 9-to-5 job will get them to their financial goals.Forty-threepercent say side hustles are essential.Forty-onepercent believe you have to be an entrepreneur just to make it. And something that hit me hard: only abouthalfof Gen Z still sees owning a home as a meaningful financial milestone.\nFor many of us, success isn\u2019t a white picket fence. It\u2019s paying off debt. Supporting our parents. Having breathing room. The old roadmap \u2014 graduate, get a job, buy a house \u2014 sounds like fiction in today\u2019s economy.\nI\u2019m living proof that the American Dream is still possible.

Sixty-five percent believe that\u2019s our best shot at building wealth. But only 17% of Americans say they actually feel confident in how the stock market works. We\u2019re out here trying. But we\u2019re often guessing.\nAnd the tools we\u2019re using? A mixed bag.Seventy-twopercent of Americans believe fintech has made investing more accessible \u2014 and it has. But too many of those platforms profit off confusion. They push people toward options trades, meme stocks, FOMO bets. That\u2019s not investing.

Tired of watching tools that could empower our generation instead exploit us for short-term gains.\nIt\u2019s why I built dub: to prove that mission-driven companies can create a brighter, more optimistic future \u2014 not just for shareholders, but for entire generations.

But I can\u2019t do it alone.\nHere\u2019s how we unlock the American Dream for Gen Z in 2025.\n1. Build the right tools. Tech companies must stop profiting off risky behavior. Build tools that feel native to Gen Z, but nudge us toward long-term investing, not YOLO bets.\n2. Teach financial literacy like it\u2019s life or death \u2014 because it is. Start from the moment our children can read. Teach compounding. Teach ownership. Teach debt and credit. These are not electives. They\u2019re survival skills.\n3. Make ownership the new norm. Let every American feel \u2014 not just hear \u2014 that they\u2019re part of this country\u2019s wealth engine. When we own a piece of innovation, we believe in its future.\nIf Gen Z stops believing in the American Dream, we don\u2019t just lose a generation. We lose the future of this country.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nWe\u2019re living in a time when you can finance pizza. Where $100 jeans can be split into four easy payments. Where \"zero interest\" sounds like free money. But behind the buzzwords and flashy apps,\u00a0Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)\u00a0is turning into one of the most financially destructive forces in America.\nWhat started as a clever tech innovation to help people \"manage cash flow\" has become a full-blown debt trap \u2014 one that\u2019s quietly ruining the financial health of working families across the country. BNPL is marketed like a budgeting hack, but it\u2019s really the worst thing that\u2019s happened to consumers since paydayloans.\nLet\u2019s cut through the hype and look at the facts. According to a 2023 report by TransUnion, BNPL usage soared 43% in a single year. Roughly 40% of users have missed at least one payment, and those missed payments often come with hefty late fees or aggressive collections. A\u00a02023 CFPB report\u00a0indicates that amongconsumersin households charged an insufficient funds (NSF) fee in the past year, 85% were also charged an overdraft fee.\nHIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS DISCOVER THE BIG SECRET ABOUT CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION\nMeanwhile, Americans are already up to their eyeballs in other forms of debt.Credit card balanceshave now hit an all-time high of\u00a0$1.12 trillion, according to theFederal Reserve Bankof New York. Auto loan delinquencies are rising fast \u2014 over 7.6% of borrowers are 30 days past due, the highest level in over a decade. And since the federalstudent loan pauseended,\u00a0more than 40% of borrowers haven\u2019t resumed payments.\u00a0We\u2019ve built a nation that\u2019s not just living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 it\u2019s now borrowing paycheck to paycheck.\nBuy now, pay later introduces a whole new type of borrowing where consumers borrow in their day-to-day lives, not for big items.\nAnd BNPL is pouring gasoline on that fire.\nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s so dangerous: it doesn\u2019t\u00a0feel\u00a0like debt. When you swipe acredit card,you know you\u2019re borrowing. When you click \"pay later\" on a website, it feels like nothing happened.

It convinces people they can afford things they absolutely cannot.\nI\u2019m seeing it firsthand in conversations across the country: People don\u2019t even realize how many plans they\u2019ve signed up for. Klarna here. Afterpay there. Affirm on something else. According to industry data, the average BNPL user has\u00a0four to six active plans \u2014 but most couldn\u2019t tell you the total amount they owe.\nAnd it\u2019s not just big-ticket items like laptops or furniture anymore. People are now financing gas, groceries and\u00a0takeout. Think about that: We\u2019re borrowing money to buy things that are gone in a week.\u00a0 Even short-term loans to make it to our next paycheck.\nThis isn\u2019t just financially unsound \u2014 it\u2019s culturally dangerous. BNPL is normalizing the idea that you\u00a0deserve\u00a0to have something now and worry about paying for it later. It\u2019s instant gratification on steroids. It\u2019s teaching young people that budgeting means stacking multiple payment plans \u2014 not actually saving money.\nINVISIBLE TAX: GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CRUSHING YOUR FINANCES\nYou know what system worked better when I was growing up?

And\u00a0only after\u00a0you paid in full did you walk out the door with the item. No debt. No fees. No collections. Layaway required patience. It taught discipline. It was about saving\u00a0before you spent.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nBNPL flips that on its head. It removes friction. It encourages consumption without consequence. Retailers love it because it boosts sales. Tech companies love it because it boosts engagement. But the American consumer? They\u2019re the ones stuck holding the bag when all those \"easy payments\" come due at once. \u00a0It\u2019s the same trap as payday loans, just with better branding.\nAnd instead of thinking about the total cost, consumers focus on the $25-a-week illusion. It\u2019s\u00a0predatory\u00a0because it masks the risk. It convinces people they can afford things they absolutely cannot.\nEven regulators are waking up. TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureauhas flagged BNPL for deceptive practices, lack of transparency and the use of consumerdata for marketing.But they\u2019re behind the curve. This market has already ballooned to $80 billion\u00a0in annual transactions\u2014and it\u2019s only getting bigger.\nSo, what\u2019s the solution?\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWe need to go back to basics. We need to\u00a0teach people to save before they spend. It\u2019s called\u00a0delayed gratification and people in America just don\u2019t understand this concept anymore. We need to stop pretending that BNPL is some kind of harmless financial tool. It\u2019s the fast track to delinquency and bankruptcy for people who can least afford it.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, we need to bring back the layaway counter at your local department store. Because the lesson there was simple but powerful:\u00a0If you can\u2019t pay for it today, wait until you can.

{"title":"Federal judges grill Trump lawyers over 'Liberation Day' tariffs on eve of enforcement","date":1753920000000,"body":"Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss the legal uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs as countries continue to negotiate.\nEleven federal appellate judges weighed PresidentDonald Trump'suse of an emergency law to impose steep and punishing tariffs on most U.S. trading partners during nearly two hours of fast-paced oral arguments Thursday, underscoring the magnitude and urgency of the case.\nAt issue before the Washington-based Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is Trump\u2019s attempt to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) \u2014 a 1977 emergency law \u2014 to enact the steep import fees and impose additional tariffs on certain trading partners. Those tariffs are slated to take force Aug. 1.\nJudges for the appeals court pressed administration lawyers to explain why Trump invoked IEEPA when there are other, more narrow statutes enacted by Congress to specifically deal with tariffs. These laws include certain caps on tariff amounts, they noted, as well as timeframes reviewable by Congress.\nJudge Evan Wallach rattled off a list of such statutes. Compared to these, he said, IEEPA \"doesn\u2019t include the word tariffs anywhere.\"\nTARIFF FIGHT ESCALATES AS TRUMP APPEALS SECOND COURT LOSS\nPresident Donald Trump, left, speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House April 2, 2025, in Washington, D.C., as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick listens.(AP Photo\/Mark Schiefelbein)\nHe added that when the law was passed in 1977, tariffs were a relevant issue included in other statutes, suggesting that, had Congress intended for them to be there, they would have been.\nJustice Department Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate acknowledged the IEEPA law does not include the word \"tariffs.\" Still, he argued that the trade deficit between the U.S. and trading partners had \"reached a tipping point,\" which he said enabled the administration to use emergency powers to take action.\n\"It\u2019s affecting our military readiness,\" he told the court. \"It\u2019s affecting our domestic manufacturing capability.\"\nShumate was also asked if the administration believes that Trump's power under IEEPA is \"unbounded,\" and, if true, whether it believes the president\u2019s actions are reviewable by the courts.\nShumate said in response he believes the administration should answer to a congressional delegation.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi speaks alongside President Donald Trump on recent Supreme Court rulings in the briefing room at the White House June 27, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Joe Raedle\/Getty Images)\nArguing for the plaintiffs, Neal Katyal told the court that Trump, in invoking IEEPA, is attempting a \"breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years.\"\n\"Our federal courts are powerless if the president can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, for as long as he wants, so long as he declares an emergency,\" he said.\nUsing the IEEPA law to enact the tariffs Trump outlined during his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" event would mark the first time in U.S. history that tariff powers would be enacted by a president in an instance not specifically delegated by Congress.\nAs the oral arguments came to a close, it was not immediately clear how judges on the panel would rule, though some suggested the possibility of partly upholding the lower court ruling that had blocked Trump\u2019s use of IEEPA.\nTRUMP TARIFF PLAN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS COURT BATTLES INTENSIFY\n\"But IEPPA has been rarely used, hasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s been over 50 years since it\u2019s been used?\" Judge Jimmie Reyna asked Shumate.\nOutside the courthouse, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who helped represent the 12 states suing over the plan, told Fox News Digital he expects the appeals court decision to come in weeks or months, not days, an acknowledgment that the Aug. 1 enforcement date will likely be well in the rearview when a ruling lands.\nStill, he said, \"We're optimistic based on the courtroom today that we will be successful (or) partially successful,\" he said.\n\"When the\u00a0federal government comes in and says that [the court] has absolutely no right to review what the president does under IEEPA, you actually heard laughter in the room,\" he said, describing it as a \"flop\" that may sit poorly with the judges.\nOn April 2, Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, along with higher, reciprocal tariffs targeting select nations, including China. He said the measures would address trade imbalances, reduce deficits with key trading partners and boost domestic manufacturing and production.\nHowever, whether emergency tariffs are the appropriate vehicle to accomplish this is an open question and one central to Thursday's oral arguments before the appeals court.\nPlaintiffs inV.O.S. Selections Inc. v. Trump argued Thursday that the looming tariffs have already introduced confusion and volatility into markets, threatening the bottom lines of small U.S. businesses and making it difficult for owners to operate under shifting guidance that seems to change on a whim.\nOthers argue the tariffs are more a negotiating tool designed to bring trading partners to the table to negotiate new deals.\nJUDGES V. TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange March 28, 2025, in New York City.(Spencer Platt\/Getty Images)\nDespite trade advisor Peter Navarro's pledge to strike \"90 trade agreements in 90 days\" and Trump'sassertionto Time magazine that it had struck \"over 200 deals\" this year, the Trump administration has in fact inked just eight such agreements over the last 120 days.\nThe agreements announced by the U.S. include deals with the European Union's 27-member bloc, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan and others.\nThe U.S. and China, which threatened each other with escalating reciprocal tariffs that climbed as high as 145%, agreed at a meeting in Geneva in May to lower tariffs through at least mid-August. Talks for a longer-term deal are ongoing.\nSmall businesses in the U.S. have been hit with months of \"complete uncertainty,\" Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation of the Liberty Justice Center, one of the groups representing small businesses in court, said in an interview Wednesday.\n\"That's largely due to the fact that the president asserts the power to impose tariffs on any country he wants, for any reason \u2014 and at any rate he wants, at any time he wants,\" Schwab said.\n\"So, there's no certainty on what the rate is going to be from one week to the next, and that's very difficult to do business with, when things are constantly changing.\"\nJudges on a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of International Tradevoted unanimouslyto block Trump's tariffs from taking force earlier this year, ruling that, as commander in chief, Trump does not have \"unbounded authority\" to impose tariffs under the emergency law.\nThat ruling was later paused by the appeals court in Washington, D.C., which agreed to consider the administration's request for relief.\nAhead of Thursday's oral arguments, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed lawyers would continue to defend the president's trade agenda in court.\n\"This morning, [Justice Department] attorneys are going to court to defend President Trump\u2019s tariffs, which are transforming the global economy, protecting our national security and addressing the consequences of our exploding trade deficit,\" she said. \"We will continue to defend the president.\"\nThe U.S. Supreme Court June 28, 2023, in Washington, D.C.(Drew Angerer\/Getty Images)\nSome Trump supporters have argued the tariffs are merely a negotiating tactic to getforeign governmentsto the table, though the administration has repeatedly vowed to use \"all tools\" at its disposal to advance Trump's protectionist policies.\nThe administration argued in a court filing that the IEEPA is the law that Congress passed in 1977 to allow the president to respond to \"unusual and extraordinary threats\" and in cases where a national emergency has already been declared.\nHowever, the plaintiffs argue that Trump\u2019s use of IEEPA to address the trade deficit is unlawful, pointing out that, by the administration\u2019s own admission, the deficit has persisted for nearly 50 years, undermining the claim of an \"unusual and extraordinary\" emergency.\nTheCourt of Appealsfor the Federal Circuit will likely move on the case quickly, with a decision expected in August. No matter the outcome, both sides have vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court, if necessary.\nIn the interim, economists noted there could be real harm the longer the court process takes.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSchwab, the lawyer helping represent the plaintiffs in court Thursday, said small business owners could see \"potentially irreparable harm\" as a result of court inaction. Already, he said Wednesday, his clients are reporting real harm.\n\"Some of the harm has already taken place,\" Schwab said in an earlier interview. \"And the longer it goes on, the worse it is.\"\nBreanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering theTrump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI and other national news.

{"title":"MORNING GLORY: President Trump and the United States\u2019 massive tariff haul in his first six months back","date":1753920000000,"body":"FOX Business host Charles Payne analyzes how President Donald Trump\u2019s trade deal with the European Union will directly impact Americans on \u2018The Will Cain Show.\u2019\nIn June, the United States collected $27 billion dollars intariff revenueon goods imported into the country. That number is expected to increase this month \u2014we will know for sure in a few days. Hold on to those numbers for a bit while considering the context in which they appear.\nPresidentDonald Trumpran and won in November, 2024 on a straightforward platform: Close the southern border. Prioritize the deportation of illegal migrants that are criminals or national security threats. Expand and extend the tax cuts that he initially pushed through in 2017 with the help of GOP majorities in the House and the Senate.\u00a0Rollback the regulatory burden on American businesses. Rebuild the nation\u2019s defenses through much higher defense spending. Protect girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports. End the era of \"woke\" by crushing \"DEI\" and \"CRT.\"\nPresident Trump also repeatedly stated from the time he came down the escalator in 2015 that Iran would not be permitted to obtain nuclear weapons.\u00a0His support for Israel has been greater than any previous president.\nLIZ PEEK: TRUMP'S MAJOR TRADE WINS COULD BE ROCKET FUEL TO US ECONOMY\nTrump delivered on all of these promises already. In six months. It\u2019s a stunning and unprecedented record of achievements and of promises made and kept by a presidential candidate early in his term.\nPresident Trump also ran onupending the international tradingsystem through the imposition of tariffs on almost every country doing business with the U.S. Skeptics of this set of claims were everywhere.\nThe numbers:\nJune\u2019s tariff receipts in the U.S. set a monthly record of $27 billion.\nJuly\u2019s number is expected to increase.\n\"[W]e could expect that that could be well over $300 billion by the end of the year,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declared earlier in July. (By contrast, total tariff revenue for the U.S. was $77 billion in calendar year 2024.) Bessent added that he estimates tariff revenue to the Treasury to top \"2.8 trillion over 10 years,\" \"which we think is probably low.\"\nIn January, thefederal treasury collectedapproximately $8 billion in tariffs.\u00a0\u00a0That number had more than doubled by April to $16.3 billion. The president has since concluded new tariff and trade deals with the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam and \u2014this week\u2014 the European Union. Negotiations with China are ongoing and more deals with more counties are expected as Trump\u2019s team on tariff negotiations ranges across the world accomplishing much, much more than most people thought could be accomplished this quickly.\nA decade ago the U.S. collected $35 billion in tariffs annually. That\u2019s quite a contrast: $35 billion into the U.S. treasury from tariffs in 2015; $300 billion estimated in 2025.\nPresident Trump made no secret about hisintentions on trade. As with all the other campaign promises, he has delivered and indeed redone the vast global trading system. Thus far it has been all gain and very little pain as far as consumers and voters are concerned. Stock markets have soared in the same period with a big dip when the president announced the outlines of his ambitious trade agenda, a dip that was erased as new highs were recorded.\nNow the question is: Will the skeptics of Trump\u2019s trade policies at least consider that they were wrong?\nLike most commentators, trade and tariffs have rarely been a topic for me. I began work in government in President Reagan\u2019s administration and since then the GOP has been a \"free trade\" party. Almost every Reaganaut called themselves a devotee of \"the Chicago school\" of economics even if they were not economists. This meant, in a general way, low taxes and low-to-non-existent tariffs, and a belief in free trade around the globe via open oceans patrolled primarily by the United States Navy with help from its allies. This post-World War II international trading system was built on \"GATT.\"\n\"GATT\" stands for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It was a multilateral agreement established in 1947 to promote international trade by reducing or eliminatingtariffsand other trade barriers between participating countries. There were eight \"rounds\" of GATT negotiations between 1947 and 1994, and they culminated in the creation of the World Trade Organization which came into being on January 1, 1995. In the 30 years since then, the \"WTO\" has set the rules and resolved the disputes among international trading partners.\nAt home, the Constitution vested thepower over tariffsin the Congress, but much of that power has been delegated to the president and his officials via Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Sections 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, and International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977. Some critics of President Trump\u2019s big declarations and decisions on tariffs have questioned whether he has enough power under these delegations to so thoroughly transform the rules of international trade.\nSuits have been filed and it will be a question of first impression for the Supreme Court if it gets there. We don\u2019t know what tariffs will eventually come before the Court if it even agrees to take up the matter. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments today in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President\u00a0Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer. This is the lead case testing the president\u2019s powers under IEEPA.\nAll of the countries above that have concluded new agreements with Team Trump seem to accept President Trump\u2019s authority, but the case bears watching.\nIn the meantime, what are the free traders doing?\nMany are issuing dire warnings about the future impacts on consumer prices and overall economic growth. Those fears have not been realized yet. In fact, GDP in Q2 of this year \u2014the first full quarter of Trump\u2019s second term\u2014 grew an unexpectedly robust 3.0 percent, according to the advance estimate released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nWhich should mean that critics ought to at least suspend judgment for awhile and perhaps reconsider their absolute commitments to \"free trade,\" allowing for the possibility that while America willingly subsidized the world trading order for 80 years after World War II, it also possesses the power of the world\u2019s largest economy and market and can indeed set new rules.\nMy perspective has changed to one of cautious approval of what President Trump is trying while remaining open to urging reversal if it doesn\u2019t work. My evolving POV is that the U.S. has shouldered the cost of defending the freedom of the seas for eight decades and that this expensive burden will only grow in the years ahead. Tariff revenue can be seen as the trading nations of the world\u2019s contribution to the cost of the American military.\nTo be specific: The \"One, Big, Beautiful Bill\" included a much-needed surge of $158 billion in defense spending, much of which is going to the Navy and shipbuilding and repair capacity expansion. Bravo.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe $300 billion intariff revenueexpected this year will more than cover the increase in defense spending. Bravo again.\n\"Free trade\" depends on freedom of navigation of the world\u2019s oceans and ultimately on America\u2019s military. Perhaps the skeptics of the president\u2019s tariff program should begin to at least consider that the era of \"free riders\" on the backs of the United States Navy (and broader military) is over and after 80 years of subsidizing the international trading order via our defense budget, it\u2019s time for trading nations to pay a share of that cost.\nHugh Hewitt is a Fox News contributor, and host of \"The Hugh Hewitt Show,\" heard weekdays from 3 pm to 6 pm ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

{"title":"LIZ PEEK: Trump's major trade wins could be rocket fuel to US economy","date":1753747200000,"body":"Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick unpacks the U.S. and E.U. trade agreement on 'Special Report.'\nHats off to PresidentDonald Trump, who is singlehandedly reordering global trade, in the face of enormous opposition. The president took office pledging to make trade fair again for Americans, and he is well on his way to achieving exactly that.\nWhile the initial roll-out of histariff programin April was clumsy, the subsequent negotiation of trade deals has been masterful. Much remains to be fully fleshed out for agreements concluded in weeks as opposed to the more customary years, but the essential ingredients are straightforward. The president and his team are working to lower the barriers to U.S. exports erected by countries around the world and, where our trading partners refuse to make concessions, charging them for access to our markets.\nHere\u2019s why he can force their hands: The United States is the world\u2019s biggest economy, at $29 trillion;Chinaand the EU come next, at roughly $19 trillion. The U.S. leads in sheer size and also in the magnitude of our consumer market, at about 70% of GDP, or $20 trillion. By comparison, the Chinese consumer accounts for only some 40% of that country\u2019s GDP, or less than $8 trillion. About 52% of the EU economy comes from consumer spending, or less than $10 trillion.\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES TRADE DEAL WITH EUROPEAN UNION\nEvery country on Earth wants to export to the U.S. Consequently, our country has clout, and the president is determined to use it. He is removing tariffs that other countries have imposed on American-made goods coming into their countries and also fighting non-tariff barriers, such as illegal government subsidies, currency manipulation and arcane regulations set up by Europe and Japan, for instance, to exclude U.S. agricultural products and other goods. Our farmers are the most productive in the world \u2013 they can out-compete anyone, which has inspired tough protectionist measures from some of our trading partners.\nHistorically, countries around the world have not dealt fairly with the U.S. Conservatives dislikeTrump\u2019s tariff programbecause they say it interferes with free trade, but the global exchange of goods and services is not free. When Europe charges U.S. carmakers a 10% duty on Chevys sent to Germany, and we only charge 2.5% on Volkswagens coming here, something is off.\nOver the weekend, President Trump negotiated the grandaddy of all trade deals with the EU, imposing 15% tariffs on Europe\u2019s imports and securing commitments that the EU will import sizeable amounts of energy. Success was not assured; the president himself, on the cusp of his talks withEuropean Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyen, put the chances of concluding a deal at about 50-50. For our relentlessly optimistic president, he was cautious in the extreme, for good reason.\nBACK FROM SCOTLAND, TRUMP ENTERS CRUCIAL TRADE WEEK AND EYES FED'S DECISION ON RATE CUTS\nActually, for several good reasons. First, the EU is a fractious group of 27 sovereign nations who, despite acting as a block, have very different economies and interests. Second, EU countries are for the most part run by condescending liberal elites who view Donald Trump as uncouth and annoying, as he persistently disrespects the globalism that bind them together. Third, they bitterly resent the United States, which is running rings around them on everything that matters, like technology and energy.\nDonald Trump shakes hands with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after agreeing on a trade deal between the two economies following their meeting, in Turnberry south west Scotland on July 27, 2025.\nPresident Trump\u2019s caution was also warranted because EU leaders like to score political points back home by standing up to him; it was quite possible that the bloc\u2019s leadership would torch a compromise in order to look strong. As it is, the deal was widely panned by European officials and economists, with the ever-obstreperous French leading the way. French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou furiously denounced the pact, describing it as \"submission.\"\nFrench Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said he did not want Paris \"to settle with what happened yesterday because that would be accepting that Europe is not an economic power.\"\nHere\u2019s a newsflash for French politicians nipping at von der Leyen\u2019s ankles; Europe isn\u2019t much of an economic power. The World Bank reports that from 2008 to 2023, EU GDP grew by 13.5% (from $16.37 trillion to $18.59 trillion) while U.S. GDP rose by 87% (from $14.77 to $27.72 trillion). In addition, EU GDP per capita as a percentage of U.S. GDP per capita fell from 76.5% in 2008 to 50% in 2023.\u00a0That\u2019s downright embarrassing.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nWhy is the EU such a laggard? First, because they have imposed stifling red tape on their domestic companies. Even the International Monetary Fund has chastised France, for instance, for their rigid work rules, which makes the hiring and firing of workers expensive.\nSecond, because the EU has prostrated itself on the altar of climate change. Its dedication to renewables has led to high power costs, with German companies, for example, paying nearly three times what the U.S. does for industrial electricity. With new technologies like AI requiring vast amounts of energy, the EU is uncompetitive.\nThird, the EU is hampered by its cumbersome architecture; getting more than two dozen nations to sign off on major policies is difficult, which has meant the continent has fallen behind on technological innovation. That means low productivity and GDP growth.\nPresident Donald Trump (R) shakes hands with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (L) following their meeting, in Turnberry, south west Scotland on July 27, 2025.(Brendan Smialowski\/AFP\/Getty Images)\nEU officials are certainly not unique in expressing frustration over President Trump\u2019s tariff battle. The conventional wisdom from economists and business leaders has been thattariffs will choke off tradeand make the world poorer. Roger Altman, the successful founder of investment bank Evercore, appeared on CNBC on Monday saying, \"Eventually, the tariffs will be passed on, dollar for dollar, to the consumer, and that will mean less consumption, less growth, less jobs and less profit.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMaybe, but it\u2019s also possible that companies will bring more production to the United States, to avoid tariffs, and that the revenuespouring into the Treasury, over $100 billion to date, will boost our fiscal outlook.

Consumers have shown continued resiliency, boosting retail sales up 0.6% for the month of June. The labor market remains solid.\nAnd while the stock market isn\u2019t the economy per se, key market indices, including the broader-based S&P 500, continue to hit all-time highs.\nNormally, this would be very good news for a president\u2019s economic agenda. But given America\u2019s current fiscal situation, it is hindering one of PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s main focal points \u2013 the hope that the Fed will substantially lower its target interest rates.\nPresident Donald Trump listens during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, July 16, 2025.(AP Photo\/Alex Brandon)\nThe American fiscal situation is a precarious one, which has brought about several debt downgrades from the rating agencies, the last being in May, while U.S. debt is supposed to be the \"safe haven\" investment for the global financial system.\nLEFT'S TARIFF DOOMSDAY PREDICTIONS FALL FLAT AS TRUMP'S AMERICA THRIVES\nThe U.S. debt\/GDP ratio is about double what most entities believe is a manageable and sustainable ceiling. Our deficit as a percentage of GDP is at wartime or deep recession levels, without the U.S. being at war or in a recession.\nAnd with such a heavy and growing debt load, now at $37 trillion, the interest cost on that debt is around $1 trillion, which is more than we spend on defense. Having debt financing costs exceed defense spending is not a signal of a healthy country.\nPresident Trump and his administration are rightfully focused on the excessive current interest cost on our debt. And, with more than $9 trillion in debt that has or needs to be refinanced this year, plus another couple trillion from new deficit spending, the cost of debt financing matters.\nThe higher the interest rates on Treasury debt, the higher the cost of financing and refinancing. That leads to higher deficits, and all else being equal, even higher interest rates as more debt needs to be financed. Wash, rinse and repeat and debt costs and deficits will keep going higher.\nSo, it is understandable that the president wants lower interest rates \u2013 even back to 1% or lower as he has recently mentioned. However, there are several challenges with that.\nINVISIBLE TAX: GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CRUSHING YOUR FINANCES\nBack to where we started, strong economic data and all-time highs in the market do not signal that interest rates are holding back economic activity. This makes it harder for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to justify rate cuts given their own mandate, although not impossible as their actions are often headscratchers.\nIt\u2019s also somewhat of a moot point, because the Fed\u2019s target rates directly impact what\u2019s called the short-end of the yield curve (aka short-dated securities like 1-month T-Bills, as an example). For the U.S. to term out its debt (refinance short-dated securities for a longer amount of time, like 10 years), the relevant yield is that of the longer-dated securities.\nWhile sometimes the Fed\u2019s rate has an indirect impact on those longer-dated securities, in recent times, it has not. In fact, we saw after the Fed rate cuts in the fall of 2024 that yields on 10-year Treasurys increased instead of decreased.\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that further cuts would have the desired effects, and could have other consequences, likere-stoking inflation.\nFor longer dated securities, the market sets the pricing, and supply and demand is front and center.\nYOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THE SOLUTION TO THE DEBT CRISIS, BUT HERE'S HOW TO FIX AMERICA'S SPENDING PROBLEM\nIt used to be that global central banks consistently increased their buying of U.S. Treasurys, but over the past decade or so, they have actually been net sellers, as countries around the world have been hurt by the mismanagement of theU.S. dollaras the world\u2019s reserve currency and are looking for ways to decrease their dependence upon it.\nSo, today\u2019s Treasury buyers are those focused on price, and with recent debt downgrades and concerns about the U.S.\u2019s fiscal foundation, they are demanding more of a premium to hold U.S. debt for longer periods of time.\nWith the U.S. continuing to run large deficits, adding more supply to this price-sensitive demand, all else equal, only drives up the yields and U.S. debt financing costs.\nSo, fiscal policy \u2013 which is managed by Congress, not theFed\u2019s monetary policy\u2013 is what\u2019s most critical today.\nThe Trump administration is currently looking at other ways to bring the interest rates down, impacting the demand side for Treasury.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe recently signed GENIUS Act may provide one avenue. TreasurySecretary Scott Bessenthas said, \"Recent reporting projects that stablecoins could grow into a $3.7 trillion market by the end of the decade. That scenario becomes more likely with passage of the GENIUS Act. A thriving stablecoin ecosystem will drive demand from the private sector for U.S. Treasuries, which back stablecoins.\"\nThis, if it comes to fruition, may help lower rates, although again, it may only increase demand for shorter duration Treasury securities.\nThere are a slew of other tools and opportunities that are likely forthcoming that can create other avenues of demand for Treasurys and help lower yields.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe tools available to the administration may be effective and lower rates, maybe even to the extremely low levels desired by the president. But it will only be a temporary solution if our deficits and debt problems aren\u2019t addressed. Furthermore, it may come with the cost of more inflation, as accommodative policies don\u2019t happen in a vacuum and have economic consequences.\nPowell and the Fed may not be willing to give on interest rates \u2013 at least at the levels the president is seeking \u2013 ifeconomic dataremains strong. President Trump will have other options, but they are only bandages. We will not a have a permanent solution until a concerted effort is made to fix our debt and deficits.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CAROL ROTH\nCarol Roth is a former investment banker, entrepreneur and author of the new book\"You Will Own Nothing\"Broadside Books.

{"title":"3 reasons California\u2019s green energy campaign is dying on the vine","date":1752796800000,"body":"Fix California senior advisor Katie Zacharia joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why she considers the rail project a 'waste of tax dollars' and the latest on Democrats' effort to unmask ICE agents as they face growing threats.\nCalifornia Democrat Governor GavinNewsom\u2019s presidential aspirationsare Washington\u2019s worst-kept secret. More than three years before the next election, he\u2019s on the campaign trail in South Carolina, protesting immigration raids on cannabis farms and even politicizing the Second Family\u2019s visit to Disneyland.\nBefore Newsom gets anywhere near Washington, he must \"confront his California problem,\" as even Politico observed. Blessed with incredible natural resources, the Golden State has the highest living costs in the nation. Nowhere is this trendmore evident than in energy,where there is a direct correlation between Newsom\u2019s wrong-headed policies and overall unaffordability.\nHere are three examples.\nSOUTH CAROLINA GOP URGES TRUMP SUPPORTERS TO GIVE GAVIN NEWSOM A 'HUGE SOUTHERN WELCOME'\nAt $4.51 per gallon, California drivers already pay the most at the pump \u2014\u00a0that\u2019s 45% higher than the national average, which hit a four-year low during the recent Independence Day holiday and kept dropping.\nCalifornia gas prices continue to be far higher than the national average. FILE: Traffic jam during rush hour commute on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California, USA.\nAs bad as that sounds, the pain is only just beginning. On July 1, motorists were hit with another 1.6-cent gas tax, andoverall gas taxesare expected to cost the average household $612 over the course of the year. A separate $0.05-$0.09 tax increase is expected not far behind. Newsom\u2019s office touted the decline in gas prices by issuing a press release bragging about it.\nSadly, the latest gas tax could pale in comparison to other factors. Industry experts are projecting a gallon of gas potentially reaching $8 in the aftermath ofCalifornia refinery closures.\nGAVIN NEWSOM IS MAKING A STRATEGIC VISIT TO A KEY PRIMARY STATE, RAISING EYEBROWS\nFor crude oil to become a usable petroleum product like gasoline, it must go through the refining process. Earlier this year, the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles and the Valero refinery in Benicia announced plans to close by 2026, taking nearly 20% of the state\u2019s total gasoline production with them, not to mention hundreds of jobs.\nThe trend is part of a sad and steady decline directly attributed to increasing red tape and regulations. During the 1980s, under the presidential administration of its former governor Ronald Reagan, California had as many as 43 operating refineries, a number that plummeted to just 14 last year, a drop of 67%. This is not for lack of resources. In fact, California has the fifth most oil reserves in the nation, outpacing places like Colorado and Oklahoma more often associated with the industry.\nNewsom has denigrated the oil and gas industry as the \"polluted heart of this climate crisis.\" He accused them of \"lying and gouging Californians\" and blamed them for \"more kids getting asthma.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAlong the way, he pursued policies aimed at making his state \"carbon neutral\" by 2045. That\u2019s political speak for ending oil and gas entirely in favor of \"cleaner\" forms of energy like wind and solar, which are unreliable, untested and often rely on products from China (where roughly 80% of the world\u2019s solar panels are manufactured).\nSTEVE HILTON: GAVIN NEWSOM'S $9 GAS NIGHTMARE LOOMS OVER THE GOLDEN STATE\nA lynchpin of Newsom\u2019s scheme was forcing drivers intoelectric vehicles.By 2035, less than a decade from now, 100% of vehicles sold in California were to be electric under a Newsom administration mandate that the U.S. Senate thankfully overturned in May.\nAs painful as the edict would have been for California\u2019s nearly 40 million residents, the shockwaves were set to extend far and wide. As many as 13 states were on a track to follow where California was leading.\nTurning Point USA leader Charlie Kirk (right) is the guest on California Gov. Gavin Newsom's (left) inaugural edition of his \"This is Gavin Newsom\" podcast.(Gavin Newsom on X)\nNEWSOM DEBUTS RAPID-RESPONSE WEBSITE AS CRITICS ACCUSE HIM OF PRIORITIZING PRESIDENTIAL AMBITIONS\nTo his political credit, Newsom appears aware of the unpopularity of some of his policies. He went on Turning Point USA President Charlie Kirk\u2019s podcast and turned heads by calling the concept of biological men competing in women\u2019s sports \"unfair,\" but that demonstrates the powerthe green movement.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNewsom is far more likely to flip-flop on cultural issues than admit thegreen agendais failing his state. In the aftermath of President Donald Trump making the rollback of the EV mandates official, Newsom\u2019s administration immediately took legal action and signed an executive order \"doubling down\" (his words) on his commitment to the nonsensical plan.\nAt the heart of the dissatisfaction with the Biden years was inflation and high costs of living, making it the top priority for more than six in 10 voters.Making energy expensivemade life expensive and Americans could not afford another four years of Biden\/Harris energy policies. Newsom\u2019s stubborn commitment to the failed green agenda, which has failed California spectacularly, should send his White House bid sputtering before it gets out of the starting gates.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DANIEL TURNER\nDaniel Turner is the founder and executive director ofPower The Future, a national nonprofit organization that advocates for American energy jobs.

{"title":"Retailers caught red-handed using Trump's tariffs as cover for price gouging","date":1752624000000,"body":"Council of Economic Advisors Chair Steve Miran joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss why tariffs have not prompted consumer prices to rise as President Donald Trump continues to broker deals with U.S. trading partners.\nIn recent weeks, headlines have been filled with warnings from major retailers about impending price hikes due totariffs reinstatedby President Donald Trump. Big Box stores likeWalmartand Target have been quick to suggest that tariffs on imported goods, particularly from China, have left them with no choice but to raise prices for American families.\nLet\u2019s be clear, these decisions are more about raising profit margins and going against Trump\u2019s agenda to bring costs down for Americans than responding to any actualeconomic pressure.\nTariffs are a strategic tool. TheTrump administration has always been clearabout that. Tariffs are designed to level the playing field, incentivize domestic production, counter predatory trade practices \u2013 especially from the Chinese Communist Party \u2013 and put America First. Tariffs protect long-term American interests, especially in vital industries like technology and manufacturing.\nTARIFF CASE PITS CATO INSTITUTE AGAINST TRUMP OVER \u2018UNLIMITED\u2019 EXECUTIVE POWER UNDER EMERGENCY LAW\nYet, many corporations are using tariffs as a convenient scapegoat to raise prices across the board, even on products not impacted by new trade policies. A recentFederal Reservereport found that retailers have increased prices on non-tariffed items, falsely implying that across-the-board cost pressures are tariff-driven. This is not only wrong, it\u2019s exploitative.\nSome retailers are raising prices on products and refusing to eat the increase despite White House urging.(Lindsey Nicholson\/UCG\/Universal Images Group\/Getty Images)\nWe all know many of these large retailers are sitting on comfortable, even expanded, profit margins because of the price hikes from COVID-19 that never came down. But it\u2019s not enough for them. They want to fleece the American consumer and blame it on President Trump\u2019s America First agenda.\nFormer Walmart CEO Bill SimonacknowledgedWalmart's capability to eat the costs of these tariffs rather than throwing the burden to the consumer: \"[T]his quarter they grew their gross profit margin in the US business 25 basis points \u2026 All that product that has the tariffs on it, they reported last quarter actually went down in price. That sort of gives them room in my view to manage any tariff impact that they would have.\"\nWHITE HOUSE DENIES TARIFFS PROMPTING INFLATION AS TRUMP PUSHES FOR TRADE DEALS\nDespite Simon\u2019s admission, Walmart has already issuedpricehikesunder the guise of tariff costs.\nWhat we\u2019re witnessing is a pattern of deflection. Rather than own up to their pricing strategies, many businesses are choosing to shift the blame onto the Trump administration\u2019s economic policy. This tactic is not only dishonest, it\u2019s harmful to public discourse. It creates the false impression that Trump administration policies are causing this, when in reality, many of these pricing decisions are being driven by corporate boards more concerned with shareholder satisfaction than consumer welfare.\nLet\u2019s be honest: these companies are not victims of President Trump\u2019s trade policy. They are powerful corporations who get to thrive in a free-market economy that the U.S. provides for them. But they\u2019re exploiting it. If they wanted to protect their customers from modest cost increases, they could. Instead, they\u2019re choosing to use tariffs, often on a small subset of goods, as an excuse to raise prices on a much larger range of products.\nTRUMP THREATENS 35% TARIFF ON CANADIAN GOODS OVER DANGEROUS CROSS-BORDER FENTANYL DISPUTE\nThe other fact the retailers consistently ignore is their role in why we need the tariffs to begin with. Major retailers have profited from the shift to outsourcing to China in recent decades. They should now bear the burden of the environment they helped create, and Americans agree.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe Protecting America Initiative, a conservative organization I work with that focuses on combating the threat of the CCP, recently polled general election voters and found that a majority of Americans are concerned that our nation\u2019s largest retailers are using tariffs as an excuse to hike prices.\nYet, many corporations are using tariffs as a convenient scapegoat to raise prices across the board, even on products not impacted by new trade policies.\nFifty-two percent of Americans also agree with Trump when he says retailers should bear the burden of any cost increases associated with the tariffs. Our data also shows that consumers want both government officials at the federal and state levels to implement accountability measures to stop retailers from artificially hiking prices.\nBRAZIL HITS BACK AT TRUMP\u2019S 50% TARIFF AS HE DECRIES \u2018WITCH HUNT\u2019 ON BOLSONARO FOR ALLEGED COUP ATTEMPT\nThe Trump administration is working hard to get costs down for American consumers and undo the economic mess that the autopen in Biden\u2019s White House left us with. By turning tariffs into a political talking point, some corporations are playing directly into the hands of our enemies, like China, which doesn\u2019t mind if American companies use tariffs as a scapegoat because it distracts from their unfair trade practices and puts pressure on the U.S. to back down.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Trump administration has never hidden the rationale for its tariff strategy. It's about America FIRST, national strength and economic independence. This is not a radical position, it\u2019s \u2013 as President Trump says \u2013 common sense. And it\u2019s supported by millions of Americans who understand that supporting\"Made in America\" manufacturingis vital for the future of our country.\nRetailers should stop hiding behind tariffs and start being honest with consumers. If you're raising prices, say so. But don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re being forced to act by government policy when the numbers say otherwise.

Predictably, liberal media outlets \u2013 led by CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post \u2013 continue to insist the OBBB will add trillions of dollars to our national debt.\nThe truth \u2013 backed by both historical experience and robust economic analysis \u2013 is the exact opposite. President Trump\u2019s OBBB will not onlyboost jobs and take-home payfor America\u2019s working-class families.\u00a0It will\u00a0slash deficits by trillions of dollars even as its targeted expenditures will strengthen our national defense and secure our borders.\u00a0As a bonus, OBBB will rapidly\u00a0accelerate the deportation of millions of illegal aliens now stealing jobs from American citizens and driving down wages.\nAt the center of the Fake News misinformation storm is the Congressional Budget Office.\u00a0For years, the CBO has been trapped in a stale left-wing Keynesian mindset and stubbornly committed to static scoring models that fail to grasp how real-world economies respond to bold, pro-growth policies. As someone who has witnessed President Trump craft his economic agenda from inside the West Wing, I can tell you firsthand: when you cut taxes, slash job-killing regulations, achieve energy dominance, defend America\u2019s manufacturing base with tariffs and fight for fair trade, the economy doesn\u2019t just inch forward \u2013 it takes off.\nPresident Donald Trump during a dinner with Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, in the Blue Room of the White House on Monday, July 7, 2025. (Al Drago\/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nExhibit A:\u00a0The Trump2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I was there when the CBO confidently projected a return to a sleepy Obama-Biden \"new normal\" 1.8\u20132.0% trend growth. But what actually\u00a0happened?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' WILL UNLEASH PARALLEL PROSPERITY\nIn 2018, real GDP roared ahead at\u00a02.9%. Business investment surged. Hundreds of billions in overseas profits came home. Small businesses and consumers finally felt like Washington had their backs \u2013 and they responded by spending, investing and hiring. All of this completely blindsided the bean counters at CBO, who missed the wave of innovation and confidence that Trump\u2019s policies ignited.\nComes now CBO 2.0 \u2013 once again stumbling into the Trump policy arena with its trademark combination of backward-looking modeling and partisan blind spots. Instead of learning from its spectacular misfire on theTrump 2017 tax bill, the CBO is now recycling the same flawed assumptions to smear the fiscal integrity of President Trump\u2019s One Big, Beautiful Bill \u2013 and the Fake News is eating it up.\nHere's how the tired old misinformation act of the CBO has unfolded: At the outset of scoring the OBBB, the CBO defaulted to its static methodology. As in 2017, it assumed a chronically underwhelming annual real GDP growth rate of just1.8%\u2013the same stale figure it has clung to for over a decade, regardless of the supply-side reforms at play. Unsurprisingly, the result of theCBO\u2019s debut analysisof OBBB was a headline-grabbing forecast of $3.9 trillion added to the national debt over the next 10 years.\nOf course, this initial forecast came under withering fire for two glaring omissions. First, as in 2017, it ignored the dynamic growth effects baked into the OBBB\u2019s permanent tax cuts, deregulatory measures, and investment incentives. Second, it refused to account for the revenue-generating power of Trump\u2019s tariff policy, which the White House projects will generate as much as $2.8 trillion over the same decade.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nUnder heavy fire, the CBO scrambled to release a\u00a0second \"dynamic\" estimate \u2013 but once again, they blew it. This time, they cooked the books by frontloading the bill\u2019s costs, artificially inflating the early debt load. That let them assume a spike in interest rates, which then conveniently wiped out the very growth their model was supposed to measure. It was a masterclass in bureaucratic sabotage disguised as fiscal analysis.\nTo wit: When you frontload spending \u2013 particularly on growth-oriented tax relief and business investment incentives \u2013 you should also frontload the growth surge those policies trigger. More investment, more jobs and more productivity from this dynamic growth surge translate into higher revenues and lower debt burdens, not higher. And with reduced borrowing needs, interest rates should fall \u2013 not rise \u2013 as the market prices in stronger fiscal sustainability.\nHad the CBO conducted an intellectually honest dynamic analysis AND accurately accounted for the Trump tariffs, it would have forecast a massivemultitrillion-dollar surplus, NOT an equally massive increase in the debt. Instead, what we got was yet another ideological forecast designed to discredit a Trump-led growth agenda that history has already vindicated once before.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThis CBO trash is what the Fake News is taking out now every day and night before the American people in its Trump Derangement Syndrome efforts to discredit what is beyond question a truly Big, Beautiful and FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE bill.\nHere\u2019s the Real News:President Trumphas designed a tax cut that will not just pay for itself through more rapid economic growth and robust tariff collections.\u00a0OBBB will\u00a0reduce America\u2019s deficits by the trillions while financing everything from no taxes on tips and overtime to a much stronger national defense and far secure border.\u00a0Get ready for the rocket ship.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PETER NAVARRO\nPeter Navarro is the White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/how-cbo-got-wrong-again-trumps-economic-bill-set-generate-trillions-surplus-not-debt","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":0,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

Spain is a pertinent example.\nIn April, the\u00a0country bragged\u00a0that for the first time, it was running\u00a0on\u00a0100% renewable energy. Later that month, a grid failure created a nationwide blackout that risked lives and\u00a0cost the country nearly a half-billion dollars.\nGenerating electricity solely through renewables makes electric grids more prone to collapse, and requires incredibly expensive upgrades to energy infrastructure that leads to higher electricity prices for consumers.\nTHE PREDICTABLE OUTCOME OF CALIFORNIA\u2019S GREEN ENERGY POLICIES HAS ARRIVED AND IT'S A DISASTER\nThe\u00a0International Energy Agency found\u00a0that for every 10% increase in the portion of electricity generated by renewables, costs go up by more than 4 cents per kilowatt hour. As a result, countries like Germany pay more than 2.5 times the average electricity rate than the United States, and over four times higher than China.\nWhen countries likeChina or Russiacan generate electricity more cheaply than their democratic rivals, they gain an important economic advantage. China\u2019s coal consumption\u00a0reached record highs\u00a0last year, and its buildout of new coal power plants reached the\u00a0highest level of construction\u00a0in the last 10 years. Russia is the\u00a0world\u2019s second-largest exporter of natural gas\u00a0and holds natural gas reserves that rival the U.S.\nWhen it comes to the environment, these countries are not extracting or using fossil fuels with the same care as American companies. In fact, the\u00a0largest carbon emitter\u00a0in the world by a long shot is China. In 2020, China\u2019s emissions\u00a0exceeded those of all other developed nations\u00a0combined.

In an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday,\" he said the \"big, beautiful bill,\" which is \"a huge leap forward for our priorities,\" is the first step in a three-tier strategy.

Ro Khanna, D-Calif.,and DNC Chair Ken Martin in particular as \"old, tired talking points\" that are typically used against any Republican tax legislation.\nJohnson stressed that the bill permanently extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which the speaker claims targeted lower- and middle-income Americans. He said the bottom 20% of earners witnessed their lowest federal tax rates in 40 years because of those original cuts and said that the new megabill expands on that by cutting taxes on tips, overtime pay, and seniors \u2013 benefits that he says will help Republicans during the 2026 midterm elections.\n\"We're giving everybody a tax cut,\" Johnson told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Shannon Bream. \"And that's going to help the economy, it's going be jet fuel.

{"title":"SCOTT BESSENT: President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' will unleash parallel prosperity","date":1751587200000,"body":"President Donald Trump opens up about the future of the country following the passage of the 'big, beautiful bill.'\nThe same issues that drove the Founders to declare independence from the Crown in 1776 drove 77 million Americans to the polls in 2024: heavy taxes, weak leadership, and an overreaching government numb to the needs of its citizens. President Trump won in a landslide victory by offering powerful solutions to each of these problems. He is the American people's declaration of independence from business as usual in Washington.\nThe president seeks to serve \"the forgotten men and women of America.\" And theOne Big, Beautiful Bill, which he signs into law today, is central to that mission. This historic legislation will make life more affordable for all Americans by unleashing parallel prosperity\u2014the idea that Main Street and Wall Street can grow together.\nNEW PROJECTION SIGNALS GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, WORKERS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'\nThe One Big, Beautiful Bill represents the priorities of the new Republican Party, which includes millions of working-class Americans who once called themselves Democrats. This bill builds on the blue-collar renaissance started by President Trump.\nSince President Trump took office in January, blue-collar wages have increased 1.7%. This represents the largest increase in working-class wages to start a presidency in more than 50 years. For comparison, working-class wages decreased during the same period under every single president since Richard Nixon with only one exception\u2014President Trump in his first term.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes President Trump's 'One Big, Beautiful Bill' will unleash an economic boom.(Getty Images\/Photo illustration)\nKey to sparking the president\u2019s second blue-collar boom has been his efforts to end illegal immigration. The open-border policy of previous administrations accelerated our nation\u2019s affordability crisis. The influx of millions of illegal aliens put an unsustainable strain on healthcare, housing, education and welfare. It also supported a black market in labor that artificially suppressed working-class wages for decades. But that ends with the One Big Beautiful Bill.\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill is more than just a tax bill. It works to ensure that illegal immigrants are not taking advantage of the safety net created for Americans. The bill also funds the completion of the border wall and provides resources to hire thousands of additional federal agents to protect our country against future illegal immigration. The goal is to redirect the estimated $249 billion inannualwagespaid to illegal workers to lawful workers and American citizens. Ending the black market of undocumented labor by funding enforcement of our existing immigration laws will result in a massive pay raise for the working class.\nUS President Donald Trump arrives to speak on his policy to end tax on tips in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 25, 2025. After visits to disaster sites in North Carolina and California, the Vegas stop is more of a feel-good victory lap, as he lays out his plans to exclude tips from federal taxes -- an enormously popular move in a city built on the hospitality industry.(MANDEL NGAN\/AFP via Getty Images)\nWe have seen American workers benefit from the president\u2019s economic approach before. Under President Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, the net worth of the bottom 50% of households increased faster than the net worth of the top 10% of households. That will happen again under the One Big Beautiful Bill.\nThe billprevents a $4.5 trillion tax hikeon the American people. This will allow the average worker to keep an additional $4,000 to $7,200 in annual real wages and allow the average family of four to keep an additional $7,600 to $10,900 in take-home pay. Add to this the president\u2019s ambitious deregulation agenda, whichcouldsave the average family of four an additional $10,000. For millions of Americans, these savings are the difference between being able to make a mortgage payment, buy a car, or send a child to college.\nThe president is delivering on his promise to seniors as well. The bill provides an additional $6,000 deduction for seniors,which will meanthat 88% of seniors receiving Social Security income will pay no tax on their Social Security benefits.\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill also codifies no tax on tips and no tax on overtime pay\u2014both policies designed to provide financial relief to America\u2019s working class. These tax breaks will ensure Main Street workers keep more of their hard-earned income. And they will bolster productivity by rewarding Americans who work extra hours. All Americans can learn how President Trump\u2019s tax cuts will impact their lives for the better witha new White House calculator.\nThese productivity-enhancing measures dovetail with the second booster in the blue-collar boom: providing 100% expensing for new factories and existing factories that expand operations, plus car loan interest deductibility to support Made-in-America.\nEconomic security is national security. This became especially clear during COVID, which exposed glaring vulnerabilities in our critical supply chains. By providing 100% expensing for factories\u2014in addition to rebalancing trade to encourage greater domestic production\u2014President Trump is fortifying our supply chains and reawakening the might of America\u2019s industrial base.\nTo help fuel this effort, the president is unleashing American energy by removing onerous regulations, increasing oil and gas lease sales, eliminating the perverse subsidies of the Green New Scam, and refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. These measures will make life more affordable for American families by bringing down the costs of gas and electricity across the country.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThrough the One Big Beautiful Bill, President Trump is taking a bottom-up approach to restoring the economy. To that end, the bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent to give businesses of all sizes the certainty they need to grow, hire, and plan for the long term. It also provides targeted relief for small businesses by more than doubling the cap on overall small business expensing. These tax provisions will put billions of dollars back in the hands of America\u2019s small business owners, which they can then use to expand their workforce and reinvigorate Main Street.\nThe intent of all these policies\u2014be it tax cuts for the working class, full expensing for manufacturers, or new deductions for small businesses\u2014is the same: to improve the lives of Americans on every rung of the economic ladder. With visionary leadership, President Trump is laying the foundation for the Golden Age he promised through tax deals, trade deals, peace deals, and deregulation.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill will Make America Affordable Again. It will cement the blue-collar boom, reignite U.S. manufacturing, and unleash the commercial potential of the greatest economy in the world.

These wins are not abstract. They are personal, tangible, and powerful.\nLet\u2019s start with taxes. For the last several years, millions of families have benefited from lower individual tax rates that helped stretch paychecks further and keep small businesses afloat.

Josh Hawley, who is bafflingly pushing an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15\/hour with additional increases indexed to inflation.\nIf wages could be raised by mandate without negative consequences, why would we stop there?

It was passed as legislation precisely to exclude unskilled workers, particularly immigrants, minorities and women, from the workforce. It has the same effect today.\nBut the financially illiterate don\u2019t seem to understandbasic economics.\nThe minimum wage is not an average wage, median wage, maximum wage or even an expected wage. It is quite literally a floor (although, as economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, the real minimum wage is zero). As reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (\"BLS\") via FRED, only 1% of workers report being paid at or below the federal minimum wage, and that data is \"based solely on the hourly wage they report (which does not include overtime pay, tips or commissions).\"\nLEFT, LEFTER AND LEFTIST: DEMOCRATS COULD BE DEFINED BY RADICAL, BIG CITY MAYORS\nSen. Josh Hawley asks questions during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Jan. 15, 2025.(Tom Williams\/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\nThe minimum wage is heavily slanted toward teens and workersentering the workforcewith few skills. As the BLS noted, \"Minimum wage workers tend to be young. Although workers under age 25 represented one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they accounted for 43% of those paid the federal minimum wage or less.\"\nWhile minimum wage directly impacts a small number of individuals, its effects ripple throughout the economy at large. If teens and unskilled workers have a guaranteed wage floor, those with skills and experience will want to be compensated even more.\nThat increases bothwages and taxes paidfor a business throughout their labor force, as well as that of all their suppliers, adding substantially to operating costs and reducing what may already be slim operating margins. The businesses will either have to make less money or pass on costs to consumers \u2013 or both.\nThis makes products and services more expensive and, in many cases, will put businesses out of business across the economy as every company now competes in a market where nonskilled workers have a high fixed cost set by government.\nNEW YORK'S SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE IS JUST BEGINNING BUT THERE'S STILL A WAY OUT\nSometimes, businesses will also reduce product sizes or service offerings \u2013 shrinkflation, as we saw under the last administration \u2013 but one way or another, that increase in labor cost flows through the economy and impacts what you are able to get for your dollars.\nIt\u2019s notable that small business owners, who often work well in excess of 40 hours of week and risk their own capital, don\u2019t get a guaranteed wage, but politicians are happy to make entrepreneurial effortsmore risky and costly.\nThe minimum wage, particularly the federal proposals, don\u2019t take into account different economic costs by region or geographic area, either.\nJust because bad policy exists doesn\u2019t mean that we should keep doubling down on it. Pay should be negotiated between parties based on value and demand for skills and services.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAn economy cannot function without being able to get people into the workforce and trained. We need to keep jobs where people can enter the workforce, learn skills and, if desired, move on in their career paths.\nAt a time whenAI is threatening jobs, and technology is replacing workers, enacting legislation that incentivizes fewer jobs and makes it more costly and difficult to run a business is patently insane.\nWages will naturally shift with the market for labor, as we have seen in recent years.

Housing affordability has been a central pillar of his campaign.\nApolicy documenttitled \"Stop the Squeeze on NYC Homeowners\" from Mamdani\u2019s mayoral campaign website argues that the city\u2019s current property tax system disproportionately benefits wealthy, White homeowners, particularly in Manhattan and affluent areas of Brooklyn, by allowing them to pay far less in taxes due to outdated assessment caps.\nZohran Mamdani speaking and a leafy neighborhood.(Theodore Parisienne for New York Daily News ;Beata Zawrzel\/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nCITY-RUN GROCERY STORES, DEFUNDING POLICE, SAFE INJECTION SITES: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT NYC'S NEXT POTENTIAL MAYOR\nIn contrast, Black, Latino and immigrant homeowners in neighborhoods like Brownsville and Jamaica in the outer borough of Queens are overburdened and at higher risk of foreclosure.\nHis solution?\n\"Shift the tax burden from overtaxed homeowners in the outer boroughs to more expensive homes in richer and whiter neighborhoods,\" the proposal reads. \"The property tax system is unbalanced because assessment levels are artificially capped, so homeowners in expensive neighborhoods pay less than their fair share.\"\nThe proposal would reduce the taxable portion of assessed property values citywide, and offset that by raising actual tax rates in wealthier areas. The result: lower tax bills for lower-income neighborhoods and higher ones for affluent areas \u2014 which the campaign describes as \"richer and whiter.\"\nThe racial component of the policy position has come in for criticism online, with broadcaster Mark Levinsharing a New York Poststory about the proposal and writing \"Oh, and Mamdani is racist, too.\"\nPolitical commentator Eric Daugherty also brandished it as explicitly \"racist\" on X, while the New York Post editorial board also slammed the proposal as \"pure racism.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Mamdani\u2019s campaign for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\nThe campaign document also highlights racial disparities in deed theft and \"tangled titles,\" which are situations where someone lives in a home they believe they own \u2014 often through inheritance \u2014 but their name is not on the deed, creating legal uncertainty about ownership.\nThe document states that predominantly Black neighborhoods face these challenges at much higher rates than White neighborhoods.\nTo address this, Mamdani is proposing a $10 million \"Tangled Title Fund\" to help city residents hire lawyers and clear legal titles so they can secure full homeownership rights and benefits.\nREPUBLICANS USE MAMDANI BOMBSHELL VICTORY OVER CUOMO AS AMMUNITION TO BLAST DEMOCRATS AS EXTREMISTS\nMamdani is a member of theDemocratic Socialists of America, whose preamble discusses a way to \"end white supremacy and racial oppression because its destruction is in the interest of all workers, including white workers.\"\nOverall, the housing document frames the city\u2019s housing inequities as structurally racist and economically unjust.\nThe document also claims that the city\u2019s tax lien sale system is exploitative and racist. When a homeowner falls behind on property taxes under the system, the city sells that debt to a private trust of Wall Street-backed investors, usually at a discount. instead of collecting the debt directly.\n\"The tax lien sale has been particularly harmful to Black, brown, and working-class homeowners, leading many homeowners to lose their home to foreclosure, or forcing them to sell below market value in order to pay off their accumulating debts,\" the document reads. \"The city is six times more likely to sell a tax lien in a Black neighborhood than a white neighborhood.

Inflation is at a four-year low. Wage growth is strong, with more than 620,000 new jobs added since January. Business investment is accelerating and optimism is returning. Underpinning that momentum is PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s pro-growth policies \u2013 and the small businesses his agenda is built to strengthen.\nWith the\"One Big, Beautiful Bill Act of 2025,\"Republicans are working to solidify Trump\u2019s agenda with the most sweeping tax and entitlement overhaul ever \u2013 to ensure the Main Street comeback isn\u2019t temporary, but lasting.\nSince February, I\u2019ve traveled across the country meeting with small business owners in nearly every sector \u2013 from family farms and factory floors to the Main Street cornerstones of restaurants and retailers. Their message is clear: they don\u2019t want bailouts, bigger tax bills or bureaucracy. They want a tax code that enables them to plan for the long term, puts more money in their pockets, and rewards \u2013 not punishes \u2013 work, entrepreneurship and growth. This bill delivers on all three.\nTHE \u2018ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL\u2019 URGENTLY NEEDS A MAKEOVER TO USHER IN TRUMP\u2019S GOLDEN AGE\nThanks toTrump\u2019s commitment to ending wasteful spending,data shows that inflation is no longer the top concern for small businesses. Today, the threat of rising taxes has taken the top spot. Unless Congress acts soon, the 2017 Trumptax cutswill expire, raising the top tax rate on small business pass-through income to 43.4%. That would hit more than two-thirds of small business owners, most of whom file taxes as individuals.\nTrump's tax relief should help businesses on Main Street, USA. FILE: Revelers on Bourbon Street in downtown New Orleans, Louisiana.(John Coletti via Getty Images)\nThe\"One Big, Beautiful Bill\"prevents the largest tax hike in history. It makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, including the Section 199A deduction \u2013 leaving more capital in the hands of America\u2019s 34 millionsmall business ownersto hire, expand and reinvest in their operations. This provision alone is projected to create 1 million new jobs on Main Street and generate $750 billion in economic activity over the next decade.\nThe bill also keeps cash in the wallets of blue-collar Americans. With no taxes on tips or overtime, it raises take-home pay for our workers without increasing costs for their employers. It repeals the IRS\u2019s $600 reporting rule, which created compliance headaches for millions of gig economy workers and small sellers. It increases the Child Tax Credit and standard deduction for working families. And it protects family farms from the death tax \u2013 preserving generational assets rather than taxing them twice.\nTRUMP PUSHES 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS SOLUTION TO FOUR YEARS OF BIDEN FAILURES: 'LARGEST TAX CUT, EVER'\nTo address the post-pandemic labor shortage, the bill incentivizes work, with work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents receivingMedicaid benefits,bringing nearly 4.8 million Americans back into the workforce and removing 1.4 million illegal aliens who do not qualify for Medicaid. At a time when small businesses are still struggling to hire, this is a necessary step to align government incentives with opportunity to pursue the American Dream.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe legislation also reinforces a key goal of Trump\u2019s economic vision:Made in America.Companies that manufacture here will benefit from targeted tax incentives, including interest deduction for American-made vehicles. They can take advantage of full expensing for investments in capital and equipment, R&D and factory construction. These provisions don\u2019t just encourage domestic production \u2013 they renew our industrial base and create good-paying jobs for American workers.\nFinally, the bill tackles one of the most overlooked obstacles to small business success:regulatory overreachand costs. Under the Biden administration, Washington added an estimated $5.8 trillion in new regulations. The \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" reins in those costs, clears out bureaucratic red tape, and restores a business climate where job creators can focus on growing \u2013 not just staying afloat.\nIT'S TIME FOR CONGRESS TO DELIVER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' TO HIS DESK\nSupport for the bill spans party lines \u2013 just not in Washington. A majority ofsmall business owners,including many left-leaning entrepreneurs, back the legislation\u2019s core provisions. That\u2019s because these ideas aren\u2019t ideological \u2013 they\u2019re practical. They reflect the real-world perspectives of the people who show up every day to keep our communities running.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nUnlike his predecessor, Trump has never lost sight of those who drive the American economy. The \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" is a reflection of his commitment to working families and small businesses.

During the previous four years, that number was higher than the current rating only once, when it hit 32% in June 2024. For reference, at the end of the first Trump administration, 33% gave economic conditions positive marks (December 2020), but that had been as high as 55% in January 2020 (just before the pandemic).\nCurrently, 62% say their family is getting ahead (14%) or holding steady financially (48%), up 5 points since January. The 36% who say they are falling behind is the lowest in four years.\nFOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM\nStill,economicsentiment is mostly gloomy: 84% are extremely or very concerned about inflation, 68% score conditions as only fair or poor, and 55% feel pessimistic about the economy.\nDemocrats, Independents, women, and voters without a college degree are among those most likely to say the economy is in bad shape, while Republicans, men, and college graduates are among those most likely to rate it better.\nFOX NEWS POLL: DEMOCRATS' FAVORABILITY HITS NEW LOW, STILL FAVORED OVER GOP IN 2026 MIDTERMS\n\"During theBidenyears, Republicans and independents were overwhelmingly negative about the economy, while Democrats were slightly less so,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps run the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"Now with Trump as president, Democrats think the sky is falling, while Republicans see rays of sunlight.\"\nBy a 21-point margin, voters oppose the federal budget legislation passed by the House of Representatives that the president calls the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" (38% favor vs. 59% oppose). About half think the bill would hurt their family (49%), while one quarter think it would help (23%), and another quarter don\u2019t think it would make a difference (26%).\nSixty percent feel they have a good understanding of what is in the OBBB, and while those voters are more likely to favor the legislation than those who are unfamiliar with it, more still think it will hurt rather than help their family (45% vs. 34%).\nViews of the legislation are highly partisan, withRepublicansfavoring it (73%), and Democrats (89%) and Independents (73%) opposed. Fewer than half of Republicans think it will help their family (46%).\nOverall, 57% think tariffs hurt the economy, the highest ever recorded in Fox News surveys -- and double the number who think tariffs help.\nWhile a majority (53%) approve of Trump\u2019s handling of border security (46% disapprove), the president otherwise receives negative marks on the issues: immigration (46% approve, 53% disapprove), and foreign policy (42-57%). His worst ratings are on the economy (40-58%) and inflation (34-64%), where he\u2019s underwater by a whopping 30 points.\nThe president\u2019s overall job approval stands at 46%, while 54% disapprove. That\u2019s up a couple ticks from 44-55% in April. His highest approval, 49%, came in March 2025 and April 2020. Men under age 45 (55% approve) and White men without a college degree (54% approve) are among those giving the president his best marks. Seven in 10 Republicans consider themselves part of the MAGA movement, and fully 98% of them approve.\nAbout 90% ofDemocratsdisapprove of the job Trump is doing generally and on specific issues, with the exception of border security, where fewer disapprove (80%). Most Republicans are with Trump, but approval drops to 68% on inflation and 75% on the economy, generally. Disapproval among Independents ranges from roughly half on border security to three-quarters on inflation.\nWhen voters are asked how they feel about Trump as a person, his ratings are underwater by 10 points: 45% have a favorable opinion and 55% an unfavorable view. For comparison, that\u2019s about on par with JD Vance (44- 53%), Joe Biden (43-56%), and Marco Rubio (42-46%), and ahead of Elon Musk (41-58%), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (40-45%), Gavin Newsom (39-45%), and Pete Hegseth (32-45%), while his ratings trail those of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (48-50%) and Kamala Harris (49-51%). Harris\u2019s higher favorability comes from more Democrats (87%) and Independents (38%) viewing her positively compared to favorable views of Trump among Republicans (85%) and Independents (34%).\nNone of those tested \u2013 not the president, not the vice president and not the former president nor the former vice president -- garnered positive marks from at least 50% of voters, although Harris comes closest.\nAs mentioned above, most are concerned about inflation (84%), including 78% of Republicans.\nBy a single point, the future of the U.S. narrowly tops inflation as voters\u2019 top concern, with 85% saying they\u2019re worried about the direction of the country. That includes 8 in 10 Republicans, and 9 in 10 Democrats and Independents.\nEight in 10 voters are concerned about government spending and Iran getting a nuclear weapon, while around 7 in 10 are worried about antisemitism, illegal immigration, and the use of the U.S. military domestically, and roughly 6 in 10 about protests in U.S. cities.\nMore Democrats (87%) and Independents (71%) express concern about the deployment of federal troops in cities in response to anti-ICE protests than Republicans (42%). On the other hand, more Republicans (84%) are worried about illegal immigration than Independents (68%) and Democrats (49%).\nThere are zero issues that all three groups, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, agree on as priorities. The top three concerns for Democrats are the future of the U.S., inflation, and U.S. troops being deployed, while for Republicans, it\u2019s illegal immigration, Iran getting nukes, and government spending.\u00a0 Among Independents, it\u2019s the future of the country, inflation, and government spending.\nCLICK HERE FORCROSSTABSANDTOPLINE\nConducted June 13-16, 2025, under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,003 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file.

But he needs Congress to do its part by ensuring that the\"One Big, Beautiful Bill\"isn\u2019t neutered by shortsighted compromise.\nRecently, Trump gave Senate Republicans the green light to make changes to the House version of his signature legislative initiative, openly acknowledging that there is room to significantly improve on its current form.\nI\u2019ve been working publicly and privately to advocate for this bill since before Trump\u2019s reelection, collaborating with some of the greatest business leaders and economists in the country to ensure that we make the absolute most of this rare opportunity to set this country up for long-term economic prosperity.\nTRUMP PUSHES 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS SOLUTION TO FOUR YEARS OF BIDEN FAILURES: 'LARGEST TAX CUT, EVER'\nWe\u2019ve identified several provisions that add significantly to the bill\u2019s \"score\" from the Congressional Budget Office (a measure of how much the legislation is projected to affect the federal budget) without offering commensurate economic benefits. Addressing these provisions would free up space to expand the bill\u2019s most impactful pro-growth elements \u2014 most significantly by creating the budget room to make theTrump tax cutspermanent.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans celebrated passing Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(Getty Images)\nOne element of theHouse billthat needs to be eliminated is a provision offering full expensing for new structures. While it might sound like a good, pro-growth idea to allow companies to deduct the entire cost of a new building the year it\u2019s placed into service, in practice no public company would ever take advantage of it \u2014 because taking the deduction would slash their reported earnings, harming their stock value and investor confidence.\nEven private businesses face structural hurdles, including the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT), income mismatches and the reality that bonus depreciation already provides ample incentive. Buildings are long-term investments. A one-year tax write-off simply isn\u2019t the deciding factor.\nGOP SENATORS EXPRESS 'CONCERNS,' 'SKEPTICISM' OVER TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL AFTER MUSK RANT\nAccording to the CBO, however, this provision alone adds $148 billion to the projected cost of the \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\" That\u2019s a huge chunk of change that crowds out other worthwhile provisions that companies would actually use to increase productivity and output.\nBlue state Republicans successfully fought for the inclusion of a much more generous cap onstate and local tax (SALT) deductions,which the House bill raises from $10,000 to $40,000. The increased cap means that about 90% of filers will be able to deduct the full value of their state and local taxes from their federal income tax, adding an estimated $320 billion to the cost of the legislation.\nOnce again, however, the projections fail to account for the actual, real-world implications of the provision. Because of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), very few filers would even be able to claim the full deduction at the $40,000 cap used in the House bill. In other words, blue state Republicans are sabotaging this legislation for the sake of political theater \u2014 they don\u2019t expect voters to understand the nuances of tax law, and when they run for re-election next year, they want to be able to tell their constituents that they went to bat for them.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIn fact, raising the SALT cap could ultimately hurt many blue state taxpayers, because Democrat elected officials in those states would use the increased cap to justify raising taxes even higher while telling voters that Uncle Sam will be offsetting a significant portion of the cost.\nTRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' FACES RESISTANCE FROM REPUBLICAN SENATORS OVER DEBT FEARS\nWe\u2019re fortunate that theTrump tax cutsare coming up for renewal at a time when Republicans control the White House and both Houses of Congress. But who will be in charge the next time the tax cuts are due to expire? We should not be forcing American families to live with the anxiety of wondering whether their taxes will automatically shoot up if the political winds aren\u2019t blowing the right way in the future. Likewise, we can\u2019t expect businesses to make the long-term investments oureconomyneeds if they can\u2019t reliably project tax rates even just a few years into the future.\nCertainty and stability are essential to sound economic policy. With the savings from eliminating full and immediate expensing of structures and lowering the SALT cap back to $10,000,Congressshould be able to make the individual and corporate tax reductions permanent, creating the conditions for long-term growth.\nThe White House launched a new website tabulating how much the big beautiful bill is anticipated to save Americans.(White House\u00a0)\nThe fixes outlined above could also create room in the budget forfull and immediate expensing of R&Dinvestments. Unlike expensing of new structures, companies would eagerly take advantage of tax write-offs on their research and development costs. This was included in the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, but is currently in the process of being automatically phased out.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCompetitors such as Great Britain and China are already offering permanent, full and immediate expensing of domestic R&D investments.

{"title":"Invisible tax: Government debt is crushing your finances","date":1748563200000,"body":"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on senators pushing for changes to the House-passed spending bill as it moves to the Senate for debate.\nMortgage rates\u00a0rose again this week, with the average 30-year fixed rate climbing past 6.8%. That\u2019s not just a post-pandemic hangover; it\u2019s a warning sign. Behind the scenes,rising government debtis putting steady upward pressure on borrowing costs.\nIf your mortgage, car loan, or credit card payments are more expensive than they were a few years ago, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 and despite what you may have heard, it\u2019s not just because of inflation or Federal Reserve policy. The surge in federal borrowing is helping inflate interest rates across the board.\nIfgovernment debthad stayed at 2015 levels, the typical family could be paying $222 less per month on their mortgage. Go back to 2005 debt levels and the number jumps to $536. That\u2019s real money disappearing from household budgets not because of the jump in home prices, but because Washington can\u2019t stop borrowing.\nDAVID MARCUS: WHY NOBODY WANTS TO CUT THE NATIONAL DEBT DESPITE EVERYONE SAYING THEY SHOULD\nFor years, economists puzzled over why interest rates kept falling. Aging populations, slower productivity, and foreign demand for American debt were all cited as reasons. One result was that Uncle Sam took advantage and racked uplarger deficits and debt. After all, refinancing was affordable at low rates. Another was that Americans got used to lower monthly mortgage payments, auto loans, and other interest rate-related expenses.\nNow, we\u2019re grappling with interest rates that have surged and stayed stubbornly high. The change followed a torrent ofunfunded federal spendingin 2020 and especially 2021 which exploded the deficit, shook investor confidence in America\u2019s long-term fiscal stability, and caused bond markets to react to policymakers\u2019 fiscal bravado.\nMy\u00a0new research\u00a0for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, along with a growing body of economic literature, shows the debt itself is pushing up long-term interest rates \u2014 and by more than some experts are willing to admit. While broader economic changes and policy decisions also play roles, this particular problem is too big to ignore.\nOver time, as trillions of dollars in debt compound, the Treasury shells out hundreds of billions more in interest payments. It\u2019s not just a problem for Washington\u2019s balance sheet. It\u2019s a problem for yours.\nEconomists have a term for what\u2019s happening: \"crowding out.\" When the government borrows more, it competes with private borrowers for capital. And when two consumers want the same thing, the price usually goes up \u2014 in this case, the price of borrowing (interest rates).\nAll kinds of important things become more expensive: mortgage payments, car loans, student loans, credit card debt. These are not abstract concerns. They determine whether plenty of families can afford to buy a home, send someone to college or buy a new car or truck. They determine whether someone can start or expand a business and provide more people with jobs.\nTake housing. Mortgage rates are now hovering near their highest levels in over 20 years. That\u2019s not because lumber or labor costs spiked, but because of the effects of\u00a0federal borrowing.\nStudent loan interest rates are tied to Treasury yields, which means college graduates are now repaying debt at the highest rates in almost two decades. Auto loan rates are rising too, pricing out lower-income consumers.\nFor Americans with credit card debt (almost half of U.S. households carry a balance) the average interest rate is now around 20%, driven in part by the same upward pressure caused by growing federal debt.\nThesedebt-driven rate increasesare an invisible tax on all of us. Families feel the squeeze every month. Businesses delay investments. Budding entrepreneurs face higher hurdles.\nWhy aren\u2019t more economists talking about the problem? It\u2019s complicated.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO), for example, significantly underestimates the effect. Its\u00a0latest projections\u00a0assume long-term interest rates will stabilize at lower levels even as government debt as a share of the economy grows. But if debt pushes rates up more than the CBO predicts \u2014 as most empirical studies now show \u2014 then its rosy forecasts won\u2019t reflect how much the federal government will pay just in interest.\nBeyond our own households, there are consequences for the whole economy and government. Higher interest costs mean less money for education, infrastructure, or tax relief. They increase the risk of a debt spiral in which interest payments themselves become the fastest-growing part of the budget.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMost people understand that the federal government\u2019s borrowing binge can\u2019t go on forever, and that it will burden future generations of taxpayers. But if you\u2019re between the ages of 19 and 99, the tax is probably already hitting you in some way each and every month.

Sometimes, they\u2019re in your face, like the taxes we pay or how long it takes to navigate the DMV. Other times, they\u2019re pedantic annoyances, like the permits some states require for kids\u2019 lemonade stands or when hair braider licenses require more training hours than EMTs.\nAnd sometimes they even impact how you take out your trash.\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing inCalifornia, where a combination of state, federal and county regulations\u00a0resulted in the closure of a landfill\u00a0that was serving Los Angeles County. Local citizens, the landfill and elected officials are dealing with a challenging and\u00a0rare chemical reaction\u00a0taking place in an old part of the landfill. It has been a massive undertaking that involves federal and numerous state regulatory bodies.\nCALIFORNIA'S GREEN NEW SCAM COULD COST YOU $20,000\nBut here\u2019s where theprogressive rubbermeets the reality road: People didn\u2019t stop throwing out their trash, so the closure hasn\u2019t solved any problems. It\u2019s merely increased the cost and complexity of trash removal, because county taxes are now paying for transport\u00a0to a landfill further away.\nToo often,government policiesare based not on helping people, but on a politician\u2019s personal and professional goals. Is there a financial crash? Regulate the banks (after bailing them out)! Is healthcare expensive? Put stringent regulations on them (even though it increases the costs)! Close all the restaurants during COVID (but keep open the ones that serve Hollywood)!\nThese grandstanding policies have real impacts on real people. When the federal government was raising the minimum wage almost two decades ago, Walmart received a lot of praise for supporting the effort. The problem was that Walmart pay was already above the minimum wage, so there was no impact on that company. But there were a lot of impacts on its small, local competitors, who went out of business.\nThat\u2019s good for Walmart. For small business owners? Not so much.\nCalifornia is theposter childfor policies that generate attention but have little positive impact on those who have the least flexibility and power. One of the highest income taxes (to fund social welfare)?\u00a0Check. Insane cost of living (caused in cities like San Francisco by housing regulations and across-the-state by high taxes)?\u00a0Check. Massive environmental bureaucracy that somehow leaves fire hydrants depleted, reservoirs empty and trash removal more expensive?\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nCheck, check, check. And as we\u2019ve seen, not even landfills \u2014 or your trash cans \u2014 are safe.\nIt\u2019s no wonder Golden State residents can\u2019t flee fast enough. And those who are left behind may not have enough jobs to support them. From 2018 to 2021 alone, 352 companies moved\u00a0their headquarters out of California to more business-friendly states because, in part, they don\u2019t want to pay the state\u2019s\u00a08.84%\u00a0corporate tax rate, which is the eighth-highest in the nation. Instead, they are heading to states like Texas, which has no corporate tax.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWith fewer people, there are fewer households to pony up taxes and fund the extravagant programs that elected officials in California have enacted. That means the residents and businesses who decide to stick it out are now faced with even higher taxes, increased costs of living and higher fees for trash pickup.\nRegulations havereal impacts, especially in states like California that are so over-regulated that even trash collection is affected. That\u2019s a basic municipal service that is essential to the health and well-being of all residents. But maybe they won\u2019t be residents for much longer anyway.

{"title":"MORNING GLORY: Trump emerges as 'closer-in-chief' to push 'one big, beautiful' tax bill through Congress","date":1748476800000,"body":"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on U.S. Senate efforts to pass President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' on 'Special Report.'\nWhen then-President-electDonald Trumpdeclared to me on January 5 of this year that \"My preference is one big, as I say,one big, beautiful bill,\"he started a snowball rolling down Congressional Hill that has gathered momentum and should be on his desk, perhaps by July 4, and certainly not later than Labor Day weekend. Trump willed H.R. 1 into being the way he willed his return to the Oval Office: By speaking clearly and repeatedly about what had to be done. Turns out the commander-in-chief is also the \"closer-in-chief.\"\nOf course, the House and Senate GOP knew they could not have allowed Trump\u2019s 2017 triumph of his first tax bill to expire at the end of this year and thus shatter an economy recovering its bearings and its potential for great growth after the disastrous years of inflation unleashed by former President Joe Biden\u2019s reckless looting of the federal treasury.\nBut neither did it seem likely they could make the Trump tax code permanent as well as add more cuts to taxable income for folks who depend on tips, for seniors and for homeowners in states with burdensome tax rates.\nSCOOP: HOUSE GOP MEMO HIGHLIGHTS REPUBLICAN WINS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'\nBut the president worked so closely with House SpeakerMike Johnson,Majority Leader\u00a0Steve Scalise\u00a0and Majority Whip Tom Emmer that he not only got the \"one, big, beautiful bill\" through the House, he got what he promised on the campaign trail last year. Now he seems likely to help Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thuneand Senate GOP Whip John Barrasso and Conference Chair Senator Tom Cotton pilot H.R. 1 through the narrows of that body.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans celebrated passing Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(Getty Images)\nBut the challenge will come when the Senate \"leaves its fingerprints\" on the bill, as West Virginia Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito put it to\"the fellas\"on the \"Ruthless\" podcast this week. Senators have ideas too. They are equal participants with the House members and the Senate GOP can also only lose three of their 53 votes and still carry the \"one, big, beautiful bill\" forward.\nThere are two things which can be done to make the bill better and also create some space for money for rural hospitals which, as Capito stressed, is of great concern to many in the GOP conference.\nMIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET \u2018BIG, 'BEAUTIFUL\u2019 WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE\nThe first big change is to add a process by which entitlement reform could commence, and the second is an\"IRA\/401k conversion window\"where a flat tax would be applied to seniors who wish to convert their IRA\/401k assets into Roth IRAs, a window which if opened for this tax year, would yield trillions in revenue next year and thus prevent the \"one, big beautiful bill\" from increasing the debt, while also being wildly popular with the demographic most likely to vote in the 2026 mid-terms.\nFirst, fiscal hawks worried about the rising debt could be lured into supporting the final version of the bill by the promise of a shot at entitlement reform \u2014 not cuts \u2014 in this Congress. To accomplish this requires the senators remember both the \"Greenspan Commission\" and the \"BRACs.\"\nThe Greenspan Commission, officially the National Commission on Social Security Reform, was a bipartisan commission appointed by President Ronald Reagan and the leaders of the two houses in 1981 to address a short-term financing crisis facing Social Security.\nLed by Alan Greenspan, its report produced the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which included both benefit-reduction and revenue-raising measures to address the projected funding shortfall. Social Security was in much worse shape then than now. Now, Social Security, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, need reforms, not benefit cuts.\nINSIDE TRUMP'S URGENT MEETING WITH HOUSE GOP TO PASS THE 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'\nThe \"BRAC\" was the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, established by law, which proposed closures or realignments of military facilities across the U.S and the world to improve efficiency and reduce costs. A BRAC Commission has been used five times \u2014 with rounds initiated in 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995 and 2005 \u2013 and each produced lists of military bases and facilities to be combined or closed.\nIts members compiled the lists and the result was presented to Congress with the choice: do nothing and the BRAC recommendations became law or pass a resolution rejecting them all. It was and remains a brilliant idea that can be applied to entitlement reforms produced by a new Greenspan Commission.\nIdaho Sen. Mike Crapo told Hugh Hewitt that a flat tax on IRA\/401(k) conversions could raise at least $1 trillion.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe new commission, like the original, would be made up of presidential and congressional appointees. It would be tasked with proposing entitlement reforms that would \u2014 very gradually\u2014 make entitlements fiscally stable. (An example: Raise the retirement age a month every year for the next 40 years, which would raise the retirement age to 69 by 2065. That is a \"reform\" not a cut, one so gradual as to be unnoticed by Social Security recipients who are already working longer without a prompt from the federal government. Similar reforms for Medicare and Medicaid can be put into place that allow for gentle transitions of the sort that responsible reforms embrace.)\nTRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' PASSES KEY HOUSE HURDLE AFTER GOP REBEL MUTINY\nI\u2019ve written about the second big add-onbefore: the flat tax on IRA\/401(k) conversions.\nIdaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told me last month this reform is very much on the table. It would raise at least a trillion dollars in one-time revenue and perhaps twice that amount or more. There is opposition from the retirement planning community that operates IRAs and other retirement vehicles, but those offered a 10% or 15% or even a 20% tax on conversion from standard retirement accounts to Roth accounts would applaud long and hard and remember this change come November 2026.\nLed by Alan Greenspan, its report produced the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which included both benefit-reduction and revenue-raising measures to address the projected funding shortfall.\nThe impact of the amendment to the tax code would fly through theSenateparliamentarian\u2019s review under the \"Byrd rule\" and more than balance out the fiscal impact of increasing the SALT deduction. Here\u2019s to sanity among the bill\u2019s drafters in the Senate: Sometimes the obvious thing to do is also the right thing to do.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWith just these two additions to the bill, both fiscal hawks and the politically minded would find the \"one, big, beautiful bill\" a magnet that could not be resisted.\nAll the Senate has to do is polish up H.R. 1 and the Congress can go home for a well-earned summer vacation.\nHugh Hewitt is a Fox News contributor, and host of \"The Hugh Hewitt Show\" heard weekday afternoons 3 PM to 6 PM ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

Now even more tariffs threaten an economy already staggering from the uncertainty set off by Trump\u2019s erratic policies, attacks on the rule of law, and threatening statements.\nAdding more injury to injury, Trump and his MAGA allies just forced the \"Big Beautiful Bill Act\" through the House of Representatives -- by one vote. Their divisive, financially unhealthy approach boils down to trillions in tax cuts for the ultra-rich, devastating cuts in basic health care and food services, and crippling new debt for us, our kids, and grandkids. Worse yet, right after the bill passed, Trump proudly announced more job-killing, cost-raising tariffs on allies and iPhones.\nWhen he ran for president in 2024, Trump promised us inflation would end \"immediately\" and that we\u2019d feel prices falling on \"Day One.\" To millions of 2024 swing voters -- a decisive voting bloc in the election -- that was the whole point of choosing him. But now prices are higher, economic growth is declining and life is harder than it was when Trump took the oath of office in January.\nELON MUSK 'DISAPPOINTED' BY TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL, SAYS IT UNDERMINES WHAT DOGE IS DOING\nSince Inauguration Day, consumer sentiment has plunged to historic lows. Moody\u2019s downgraded America\u2019s credit rating for the first time in over 100 years.\u00a0 Ford and Walmart are raising prices because of the tariffs.\nNow, instead of making our economy take off like a \"rocket ship,\" as he also promised, Trump is killing it with a sweetheart tax deal for his Mar-A-Lago friends. A president who promised to stand up to the establishment is effectively laundering taxpayers\u2019 money to line the silk pockets of his own preferred elites -- to the detriment of middle-class families and American business.\nNow, the American economy, which was unequivocally outperforming every other country on earth when Donald Trump tookover, is falling behind in ways it hasn\u2019t in decades.\nNO MILLIONAIRE TAX HIKE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'\nSpecial tax giveaways, like a write-off for buying private jets, are paid for with the biggest Medicaid cuts in history, higher health insurance premiums, and gutting food programs for distressed working families.

The reduction in American tariffs allows China to resume sales to the U.S.\u2014America accounts for more than a third of global consumer spending\u2014but the reduction in Chinese tariffs does little to permit American goods to enter China. The main obstacles to American exports to China are China\u2019s non-tariff barriers, and the announced pause does nothing to end non-tariff barriers put in place before April 2, \"Liberation Day,\" as Trump called it.\nBILLIONAIRE RAY DALIO RAISES ALARM OVER CHINA, SAYS TRUMP RENEGOTIATING TRADE DEALS 'HAS TO HAPPEN'\nMoreover, the reduction inU.S. tariffsis akin to unilateral disarmament. U.S. tariffs are generally remedies for China\u2019s theft of U.S. intellectual property and its increasingly predatory trade practices. During the pause, China is continuing these unacceptable practices without facing the penalty of America\u2019s elevated tariffs.\n\"China came out on top,\" Alan Tonelson, an American trade expert who blogs at RealityChek told me. \"No question, we got the short end of the stick.\"\nTrump\u2019s \"tariff war,\" as the Chinese regime calls it, could not have come at a worse time for the Communist Party.\nThe country\u2019s economy was already in distress. Yes, the National Bureau of Statistics continually issues reports of robust growth of gross domestic product\u20145.4% in the first quarter\u2014but in reality, the economy looks like it is contracting. Price data for February, March, and April confirm China is in a deflationary spiral.\nDONALD TRUMP DETAILS 'MOST EXCITING PART' OF CHINA TRADE AGREEMENT\nTrump\u2019s \"Liberation Day\" tariffs battered China\u2019s already struggling export sector. Factories were closing, unpaid workers were demonstrating in the streets, smaller banks were restricting withdrawals. As Trump suggested to Baier, the Chinese regime was struggling and might not have survived his high tariffs.\nThe 90-day pause, therefore, gave the Chinese regime a lifeline.

The Communist Party, almost everyone then assumed, would see it in its interest in maintaining an international system that was responsible for China\u2019s rise.\n\"By now, it\u2019s clear that our hopeful assumptions about China\u2019s trajectory were fundamentally wrong,\" Charles Burton of the Sinopsis think tank told me this week. \"As China grew stronger, the Communist Party became even more hostile, belligerent, and dangerous.\"\nThis month,Xi Jinpingdemonstrated that cooperation with his hostile, belligerent, and dangerous regime is not possible.

The attorneys' public social media posts also showed them supporting left-wing political groups and acts of defiance against President Donald Trump's executive directives.\n\"US Attorneys must be nonpartisan and objective in their work and the partisan backgrounds of these attorneys add to the doubts,\" Keene said. \"Far too many questions remain unanswered about this incident. The DOJ must investigate this matter immediately.\"\nIn early January, NYC launched its congestion pricing program, ordriver's tax,which imposed a $9 daytime toll on most individuals driving their cars into Manhattan's core, south of Central Park. A month later, the Trump administration issued a federal order meant to halt the program by March 21, but the tolls have continued as the result of a federal lawsuit filed by New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the state agency that runs New York City's public transit system.\nIF THESE STATES DON\u2019T COMPLY, WE WON\u2019T APPROVE THE FLOW OF THE BILLIONS GOING TO THEM: SEAN DUFFY\nLicense plate readers, such as those pictured above, are being used by New York City officials to tax drivers operating their vehicles in the city.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)\nThe Department of Transportation and the MTA subsequently reached an agreement extending the deadline to end the program until at least the fall.

This reality is not disputed by pretty much any credible person or entity, including the Treasury and the Fed.U.S. government debtis massive, currently north of 120% of GDP, an amount that is close to double what many institutions consider to be sustainable debt levels.\nOur deficit is running at a wartime level, around double the historic average as a percent of GDP, and interest on the debt has now surpassed spending on defense, which is not a healthy indicator for a country and its fiscal stability.\nA main cause of this issue isCongressand their years of reckless overspending. Unfortunately, it lies in their hands to fix the problem they helped create.\nUS HEADING TOWARDS ECONOMIC \u2018HEART ATTACK\u2019 IF DEBT IS NOT CUT SOON: WORLD\u2019S LARGEST HEDGE FUND FOUNDER\nCurrently, Congress is at work on \"one big, beautiful bill\" to address taxes and spending. And what we have seen thus far is still too big and doesn\u2019t address the critical issues at hand. Frankly, the new bill needs a \"fat shot\" (the humorous moniker President Donald Trump used for weight-loss drugs like Ozempic). And without it, we are just going to push our country nearer to a fiscal cliff.\nAmerica is facing a looming debt crisis. Will Congress have the will to fix it?\nThe problem with our finances is not one of tax collection, it is a spending problem. Federal government \"revenue\" was nearly $5 trillion for last fiscal year. That is more than the GDP of every country on earth, except the U.S. and China. Still, that is not enough for the government, which then spends that $5 trillionplusanother $2 trillion \u2013 around 6-7% of GDP \u2013 which then needs to be financed.\nAfter decades of being irresponsible, we are dangerously close to thatfiscal cliff.I worry about the prospects of a debt spiral. That is where the interest on our debt drives up the deficit (as it has). As the government needs to finance that deficit, the supply of Treasury debt increases. That then drives up Treasury yields, which increases our interest costs. That increases the deficits, which again have the same impact and that vicious cycle continues.\nSEAN HANNITY: THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION IS A 'TOTAL, UNMITIGATED DISASTER'\nAnd that\u2019s with debt servicing costs, running at $1.2 trillion at the end of 2024, plus entitlements already exceeding the tax revenue collected, before considering any other spending.\nYet, while everyone knows our debt position is a problem, there doesn\u2019t seem to be the political will to fix it.\nIn a recent X post, Stephen Moore, who has advised Trump on economic issues,posted, \"You\u2019ll need a microscope to see the GOP\u2019s spending cuts! The CBO projects a staggering $89.3 trillion in federal spending over the next decade. The House plan proposes a mere $1.2 trillion reduction, leading to a total of $88.1 trillion\u2014a tiny 1.5% cut! Meanwhile, the Senate suggests an almost laughable $4 billion reduction against $521 billion in increases.

But overdoing the treatment can kill the patient instead, without removing the carcinogens in the economy. Fortunately, the administration\u2019s negotiators have called a truce, and we can reevaluate the treatment\u2019s effectiveness.\nThe last five weeks have seentremendous market turmoil, and not just domestically. The chaos that ensued after April 2 extended around the globe and has forced many nations to the negotiating table with the US\u2014and that includes countries that engage in unfair trade practices. In that sense, the tariffs have been successful.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s play here is to use tariffs as a tool of statecraft to force other nations into reducing their trade barriers through bilateral negotiations. To that end, the preliminary agreement with the United Kingdom shows some promise.\nAmerica must also seriously evaluate what turned the Industrial Belt into the Rust Belt. This hollowing out of the nation\u2019s industrial base was not caused primarily by international trade. Instead, the primary carcinogens were terrible regulatory and tax policies.\nPresident Trump has also used the threat of tariffs very effectively to help secure America\u2019s southern border and stem the flow of fentanyl, which had become the number-one killer of young people.\nINFLATION TICKED SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN APRIL AS TARIFF IMPACT LOOMS\nButthe drama around tariffshas had side effects, like chemotherapy killing off healthy cells in the body. This collateral damage could be found in survey data from the regional Federal Reserve Banks and purchasing manager indexes, all of which pointed to sharp declines in business optimism and planned capital expenditures.\nIn short, the on-again-off-again nature of these tariffs has made it extraordinarily difficult for businesses and consumers to plan. There has also been substantial turbulence in Treasury markets, gold prices, and equities.\nThat is not a broad condemnation of tariffs, just as the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation are not a denunciation of cancer treatments. But it does illustrate why heavy-duty therapies like radiation must be used in a targeted manner. The inaccurate \"reciprocal\" tariff rates released on April 2 caused significant\u2014and unnecessary\u2014damage domestically.\nDuring the current pause in this tariff fight, theTrump administrationwould do well to reevaluate its tariff strategy, ensuring, for example, that its reciprocal tariff rates are in fact truly reciprocal.\nTRUMP REPEATEDLY WALKED BACK TARIFFS IN FIRST 100 DAYS AS WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES LATEST DUTY TAX RELIEF\nAmerica must also seriously evaluate what turned the Industrial Belt into the Rust Belt. This hollowing out of the nation\u2019s industrial base was not caused primarily by international trade. Instead, the primary carcinogens were terrible regulatory and tax policies.\nMost of our economic wounds are self-inflicted.Chinadid not build a massive, bureaucratic regulatory state in this country. Likewise, we can\u2019t blame China for our burdensome, overly complicated tax code with high marginal rates. We did that to ourselves.\nThis is perhaps best illustrated by answering a geography question: where is the Rust Belt? It\u2019s inChicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, Youngstown, Pittsburgh, etc. In other words, it\u2019s those areas of the country where liberals have imposed particularly high taxes, overregulation of industry, and forced unionization.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nConversely, where is manufacturing seeing a rebirth in America? It\u2019s coming back in places like Texas, Tennessee, and the Carolinas\u2014states with low (or no) income taxes, less regulation, and right-to-work laws.\nFailed domestic public policy is the primary carcinogen wrecking America\u2019s industrial base, and tariffs can\u2019t fix that. At best, fixing international trade problems will give a temporary boost to domestic manufacturing, but the cancer will keep growing.\nPresident Trump\u2019s tariff diplomacy is working to create a level playing field and open foreign consumer markets to domestic producers, but America needs to look within toreshore manufacturingand rebuild the industrial base.\nJust throwing tariffs at the problem is like undergoing chemotherapy and radiation without any lifestyle changes. Imagine enduring all the painful side effects of such treatments while smoking cigarettes, maintaining a poor diet, avoiding exercise, and exposing yourself to asbestos and too much sunlight\u2014that\u2019s the equivalent of what\u2019s happening today!\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIf you think this is hyperbole, consider that the regulatory compliance cost for manufacturers in America is about $50,000 to $60,000 per worker, and then there\u2019s a tax burden on top of that.Reducing trade abusesis insufficient to reform the domestic policies which have made American workers unemployable in many industries.\nTariff diplomacy can go a long way, provided it is targeted and tailored, but we still need a tax-cut bill and more deregulation if we want to heal the patient.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM AJ ANTONI\nE.J.

And, I think for a long time, Republicans were sort of in denial \u2013 not just Republicans, but sort of free market types were in denial \u2013 and they didn't want to talk about income equality.\"\n\"I think they should absolutely talk about it, because what's causing it is not free markets,\" he said. \"It's something that I think everybody should oppose, which is government manipulation of the monetary system.\"\nSt. Onge was reacting to data showing that billionaires' share of the GDP increased from 14.1% in 2020 to 21.1% in 2025, as reported by Johns Hopkins economistSteve Hanke.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s private bank estimated that the number of billionaires in the U.S. increased from 1,400 in 2021 to nearly 2,000 as of 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported in April.\nDOGE SHOULD 'DEFINITELY' LOOK AT FEDERAL RESERVE COSTS, ELON MUSK SAYS\nPresident Donald Trump, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and former President Joe Biden(Getty Images)\nThe Federal Reserve is America's central bank, which sets monetary policies and oversees banks. It acts independently, meaning it does not require approval from the president or Congress when enacting policies.\nSt. Onge explained to Fox News Digital that \"debt is a rich man's game\" and that billionaires have benefited financially since the pandemic as the Fed worked to \"manipulate interest rates\" down below market value, which subsidized loans.\n\"During COVID, you could get a mortgage for, you know, three, three and a half percent, when inflation was running higher than that,\" he explained. \"You were literally being paid to borrow money, which is not a free market outcome.\u2026 So it makes loans cheap and the rich overwhelmingly borrow money.\"\nELON MUSK WARNS FEDERAL RESERVE MAY FACE DOGE AUDIT\nThe average debt for the top 5% of Americans sits at about $600,000, he said, while the average debt for the vast majority of Americans is roughly $74,000.\n\"That's about a nine times difference,\" he said of the data. \"So if you make loans too cheap, you are giving nine times more money to rich people.\u2026 If you make loans cheap, you're functionally giving $9 to rich people for every $1 to give everybody else.\"\nAssets are even more skewed, he explained, with the top 5% of Americans holding $7.8 million in assets compared to the average American's $62,000 \u2013 notching 130 times the difference between the two demographics, he said.\n\"The value of a stock or even a house are based on the future stream of income, and those are all discounted by the interest rate,\" he said. \"And so pretty close to mechanically, if you cut interest rates in half \u2013 long-term interest rates \u2013 you are doubling the value of stocks.\"\nThe nation's wealthiest residents saw their billions grow even larger in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic due to policies from the Federal Reserve that have deepened the chasm of income inequality, economic experts report.(Jason Reed\/File Photo\/Reuters)\nSt. Onge pointed to theAmerican economyin the 1970s and the early 2000s, outlining that growth \"took a big step down\" in the 2000s while asset values, such as housing prices and the stock market, skyrocketed.\n\"The reason is because, since the 1970s, the Fed has very aggressively held rates low, and so this has caused all those assets to go up. So stocks have gone up, housing has gone up. And again, those are rich men's games. Overwhelmingly, people who own stocks are rich. Housing is even more skewed.\"\n\"So if you've got a nine times difference on loans between the bottom 50% and the top 5%, and then you've got 130 times on assets, then the Fed manipulating rates down \u2013 they're not doing it to make rich people rich, hopefully \u2013 but that's sort of the consequence of doing that,\" he said. \"Holding long-term interest rates low is to shower money on rich people and to shower it in proportion to which they're rich, right?

Mike Dunleavy reacts to President Trump's call for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund and ways it could potentially benefit the American people.\nAmerica\u2019s economic future hinges onenergy security, supply chain resilience, and strategic investment in infrastructure. As global markets shift and federal policymakers seek solutions to boost U.S. competitiveness, Alaska has implemented policies that enhance economic resilience, attract investment, and solidify our role as a key driver of national growth.\nUnder theBiden administration, burdensome regulations and restrictive permitting processes hindered growth, deterring investment and delaying key infrastructure projects. However, with the Trump administration once again acting as a force multiplier for economic expansion, Alaska is making tremendous strides to unlock its full potential.\nAlaska\u2019s competitive advantagesare rooted in a framework designed to ensure responsible resource development while prioritizing economic growth. Our vast reserves of oil, gas, timber, and minerals provide reliable access to critical resources essential to manufacturing, defense, and technology industries.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP'S ALASKA PIPELINE COULD FUEL AMERICA'S ENERGY NEEDS AND HIS LEGACY\nSince theTrump administrationtook office, Alaska has made significant progress in streamlining permitting processes, reducing bureaucratic obstacles that have historically stifled investment. The Alaska LNG project, a cornerstone of our long-term energy strategy, is now advancing with critical federal approvals, allowing us to bring American natural gas to global markets including Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan, which recently signed a letter of intent to purchase LNG.\nTrade and economic expansion reinforce Alaska\u2019s role as a national asset. From 2013 to 2022, Alaska\u2019s imports surged by 164 percent, increasing from $1.4 billion to $3.7 billion, while exports rose by 24 percent, from $4.5 billion to $5.6 billion. The result is a $1.9 billion trade surplus, underscoring the state\u2019s growing importance in global commerce. Additionally, Alaska\u2019s economy has grown more than 40 percent since 2000, with GDP rising from $38.5 billion to $54.1 billion in 2023.\nInfrastructure investment further enhances Alaska\u2019s ability to compete in the global economy, as we work to modernize ports, airports, and broadband networks. Thefederal government\u2019srenewed focus on reshoring supply chains underscores the importance of states like Alaska that have the capacity and natural resources to support domestic production. In response, our administration has actively worked to secure federal funding for infrastructure projects that will improve transportation networks and connectivity, ensuring that businesses investing in Alaska have the logistical support they need to thrive.\nAlaska is uniquely positioned to meet growing national demands for space access and missile defense, thanks in large part to the Alaska Aerospace Corporation (AAC). Operating the Pacific Spaceport Complex on Kodiak Island, one of only four vertical orbital launch sites in the U.S., AAC offers unmatched capabilities for hypersonic system testing and secure space launch in a low-congestion environment. With its vast geography, strategic location, and proven expertise, Alaska is primed to expand its role in strengthening America's space and defense infrastructure.\nAlaska is also emerging as a prime location for data center development, offering a unique opportunity for domestic and international companies seeking secure, energy-efficient locations for digital infrastructure. With a cool climate that reduces cooling costs, abundant renewable and conventional energy sources, and proximity to both U.S. and international markets, Alaska is an ideal location for data centers that require reliability, security, and sustainability.\nWorkforce development initiatives are expanding to ensure that Alaskans have access to high-paying jobs in emerging industries, from energy to advanced manufacturing. By partnering with industry leaders and educational institutions, we are creating pathways for skills training and certification programs that align with the needs of modern industries. This commitment to workforce readiness is critical in ensuring that Alaska\u2019s economy remains competitive and that opportunities created through resource development directly benefit our residents.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nUnlike restrictive mandates that stifle innovation, our approach, The Alaska Standard balances resource development with conservation, ensuring long-term sustainability while maximizing economic opportunity. This model reinforces that responsible development and environmental stewardship can coexist, benefiting both present and future generations. Our constitutionally protected Permanent Fund Dividend is a direct example of how Alaska ensures that the benefits of resource development flow directly to its people rather than enriching foreign adversaries.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAlaska is taking decisive action to enhance economic vitality and competitiveness. Whether through energy, mining, technology, aerospace or infrastructure, we are creating an environment where investment is not only welcomed but encouraged. The progress being made today is a testament to what is possible when state and federal policies align to support innovation, growth, and opportunity.\nWith a renewed commitment to these principles, Alaska is helping to shape the next chapter of America\u2019s economic success. We encourage those looking to make long-term, strategic investments to recognize that Alaska is not just a resource-rich state, it is a blueprint for how American innovation and economic growth can be responsibly achieved in the 21st century.\nRepublican Mike Dunleavy is governor of Alaska.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/americas-last-frontier-our-most-strategic-investment","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1,"topic_inflation":0,"topic_taxes":0,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":0,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

{"title":"Trump\u2019s healthcare order will help fix healthcare for everyone","date":1747008000000,"body":"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nOne ofPresident Donald Trump's most significant achievementsduring his first 100 days in office was his\u00a0executive order\u00a0requiring \"radical\" healthcare price transparency. The order doubles down on his first-term\u00a0hospital\u00a0and\u00a0health insurance\u00a0price transparency rules requiring the publication of actual prices of care and coverage, including discounted cash and negotiated insurance rates.\nThis informationprotects patients from overchargesand empowers them to reduce inflated costs through choice and competition. The executive order requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Department of the Treasury to issue rules strengthening, standardizing and enforcing systemwide price transparency by the end of this month.\nTrump's healthcare price transparency effort will revolutionize healthcareand the entire economy.It's a pro-worker, pro-growth, free-market policy to boost worker paychecks and business earnings.\n5.5 MILLION PATIENTS' INFORMATION EXPOSED BY MAJOR HEALTHCARE DATA BREACH\nWhen employers and unions can access actual prices throughout the healthcare system, they can spot wide price variations for the same care, expose middle players driving up costs and design affordable health plans. They can share their savings with workers in the form of lower premiums and higher wages.\nPresident Donald Trump''s healthcare Executive Order is aimed at a billing transparency. (AP Photo\/Mark Schiefelbein)\nUnder the status quo, healthcare is fundamentally un-American. It is the only economic sector where consumers cannot see real prices before they buy.\nNo functioning market can exist under these conditions. As a result, prices for the same care can range by 10 times, even at the same hospital.\nFor instance, C-sections varyfrom $6,000 to $60,000and MRIs from\u00a0$450 to $6,500. That isn't a marketplace \u2014 it's Russian Roulette that allows Big Health to profiteer off patients' misery.\nFor decades, health insurers have hidden prices and claims information, facilitating spread pricing that robs workers and employers. Employer-sponsored family health plans now cost $25,600 annually\u00a0and increase by\u00a0double-digits\u00a0each year. Research\u00a0shows\u00a0that about the same amount of compensation gains for average workers since 2000 has gone to premiums as paychecks, a major cause of wage stagnation.\nUnfortunately, hospitals and health insurers haven't complied with Trump's first-term rules. According to a recent study by\u00a0PatientRightsAdvocate.org,\u00a0only 21.1%\u00a0of hospitals nationwide are fully complying with the hospital rule.\nThe Biden administration didn't meaningfully enforce the rule, issuing\u00a0only 25 financial penalties\u00a0on the thousands of hospitals that didn't comply. Biden also\u00a0rolled back\u00a0the rule, allowing the posting of unaccountable estimates in lieu of actual prices needed to shop. And health insurers have buried their data disclosures in massive files full of\u00a0meaningless \"ghost codes\"\u00a0that crash computers and are nearly impossible to parse.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nTrump's new order increases enforcement to boost compliance, requires actual prices \u2014 not estimates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0so patients can shop with financial certainty, expands transparency requirements throughout the healthcare system, and standardizes data disclosures, so consumers can make meaningful price comparisons. It gives people prices before they receive care.\nTrump's order will also enact overdue requirements for health insurers to provide Advanced Explanations of Benefits (AEOBs), required by the bipartisan\u00a0No Surprises Act\u00a0that passed at the end of 2020. AEOBs let patients know exactly what they'll owe \u2014 including their out-of-pocket patient responsibility \u2014 giving them financial peace of mind.\nUnder the status quo, healthcare is fundamentally un-American. It is the only economic sector where consumers cannot see real prices before they buy.\nThey also empower employers and unions to audit their health plans and verify claims payments match provider bills and posted prices. Employers and unions can then eliminate spread pricing that\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as the New York Times\u00a0reported last year\u00a0\u2014 often requires their health plans to pay far more to middle players than providers.\nDrawing on a JAMA study concluding that 25% of U.S. healthcare spending ($4.9 trillion in 2023) is waste, overcharges, and fraud, economists estimate systemwide price transparency can generate approximately $1 trillion of savings. Putting $1 trillion a year in overbilling back into\u00a0the productive economy, including worker paychecks and business investment, will result in an enormous annual economic stimulus.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHealthcare price transparency is the most important microeconomic reform in American history. It creates a functional, competitive marketplace that restores choice, accountability and trust. When prices are clear, markets work. When markets work, costs fall. And when costs fall, wages rise.\nPresident Trump's executive order \u2014\u00a0and the ensuing federal rules issued later in May \u2014will finally make healthcare price transparency a reality. They will solidify Trump's legacy as the president who fixed American healthcare.\nCynthia A.\u00a0Fisher\u00a0is a life sciences entrepreneur, and founder and chairman ofPatientRightsAdvocate.org.\nArthur B.

Republican leaders had warned that failing to do so would lead to a tax increase of over 20% for millions of Americans, if TCJA were allowed to expire at the end of this year.\nThere is no information in the bill so far about state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps, which have been asignificant point of contentionbetween blue state Republicans critical to keeping the House majority, and GOP lawmakers from deeper red, lower-tax states.\nSCOOP: REPUBLICANS DISCUSS DEFUNDING 'BIG ABORTION' LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN TRUMP AGENDA BILL\nPresident Donald Trump is helping to get House Republicans' budget bill over the line.(Getty Images)\nAnother notable exclusion is anew millionaires\u2019 tax bracket.Trump had floated the idea of a small tax increase on the ultra-wealthy, and a source familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital earlier this week that Trump was considering allowing a pre-TCJA 2.6% tax hike on people making $2.5 million per year or more.\nThose measures and others are not necessarily excluded from the final bill, however.\nThe legislation is also expected to include new Trump tax pledges like eliminating taxes on tips, overtime wages and Social Security checks for retirees.\nMore elements are expected to be added in the coming days via amendments. The full legislation is expected to advance through the Ways & Means Committee, the House\u2019s tax-writing panel, on Tuesday afternoon.\nRelease of the legislation is a major sign of progress for House GOP leaders, who had been forced to punt their initial planned deadline of having a bill on Trump\u2019s desk by sometime between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.\nBut SALT deduction caps and a millionaire\u2019s tax hike are two of the most volatile discussion points.\nHouse Ways & Means Committee Chair Jason Smith said his panel will advance the bill on Tuesday.(Tom Williams)\nHouse Republicans currently have a razor-thin three-vote margin, meaning they can afford to have little dissent and still pass anything without Democratic support.\nThey\u2019re hoping to do just that, with virtually no Democrats currently on board with Trump\u2019s massive Republican policy overhaul.\nRepublican lawmakers are working to pass their legislation via the budget-reconciliation process, which lowers the Senate\u2019s passage threshold from 60 votes to 51, lining up the House\u2019s own simple majority threshold.\nReconciliation allows the party in power to effectively skirt the minority and pass broad pieces of legislation \u2013 provided they address taxes, spending or the national debt.\nTrump wants Republicans to use the maneuver to tackle his priorities on the border, immigration, taxes, defense, energy, and raising the debt ceiling.\nBROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY\nBoth the House and Senate passed frameworks setting the stage for the bill earlier this year.\nNow, the relevant committees of jurisdiction on either side must craft policy in line with that framework, before all the parts are fitted into a final bill that must again pass both houses of Congress before being signed into law by Trump.\nThe most recent portion released by the House Ways & Means Committee would increase the current maximum CTC from $2,000 to $2,500.\nIt would also boost the maximum deduction for qualified business income, a tax provision known as 199A, from 20% to 22%.

{"title":"Trump\u2019s latest move proves his manufacturing Golden Age is just fools\u2019 gold","date":1746489600000,"body":"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the Trump administration\u2019s tariff negotiations with China and more on \u2018Special Report.\u2019\nPresident Donald Trump continues to promisethat his tariff regime will usher in a new Golden Age for American workers with an explosion of high-paying manufacturing jobs across the Rust Belt and America.\u00a0 These tariffs will certainly drive up the costs of imports, hurting American consumers. As demand for foreign goods declines, the unfairly maligned trade deficit targeted by the president may indeed narrow. But more expensive imports also guarantee the supposed manufacturing renaissance will turn out to be fools\u2019 gold for American workers and will not boost exports.\nContrary to popular belief,American exporters have enjoyeda manufacturing renaissance. Since 1994, American exports have nearly\u00a0tripled, even after you adjust for inflation.\nAmericangoods exported exceeded $2 trillionlast year. America\u2019s aerospace industry now exports nearly $100 billion a year. The American automotive sector exports more than\u00a0$160 billion annually, nearly doubling in inflation-adjusted terms since 1994. American soybean farmers supply livestock around the globe with feed. Each of these export-intensive sectors stands to lose jobs due to these tariffs.\nUS TRADE REPRESENTATIVE SAYS IT\u2019S A MATTER OF \u2018WEEKS\u2019 BEFORE NEW TRADE DEAL ANNOUNCEMENTS\nFirst, don\u2019t expect an overall gain in American manufacturing jobs. Certainly, individual companies may benefit. A tariff on steel might save a few jobs at a specific steel mill. But the cost for every American manufacturer using this higher-priced domestic steel will also increase.\nPresident Donald Trump holds a tariff chart comparing the U.S. and other nations.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI\/AFP via Getty Images)\nAmerican manufacturing relies on a complex global supply chain utilizing imported parts. Automakers, construction firms and appliance makers all must pass this cost along \u2014 sometimes cutting wages or even jobs to stay afloat.\nNumerous American companies have already begun laying off American workers in response to the tariffs, including at\u00a0five Stellantis plants. Currently,\u00a0up to 30% of North American auto production\u00a0may be temporarily halted due to the tariff uncertainty. These headlines will become routine if the trade war continues.\nAmerican manufacturers, who export their American-made goods to the rest of the world, will fall behind as their input costs increase. This danger compounds as other nations retaliate against us by imposing their own barriers.\u00a0As American exporters find their market shares shrinking and costs rising, American companies will see their profits plunge and American jobs vanish.\nSecond, the limited tariff-created manufacturing jobs will not be better paid jobs. Good-paying jobs are contingent on productivity.\u00a0Higher tariffs lower labor productivity\u00a0as less efficient businesses are protected from competition.\nThanks largely to the innovation and efficiencies from free trade, our jobs market has diversified away from a concentration of jobs in a lower-paying, physically demanding industry. The burgeoning sectors have supplied tens of millions of Americans with opportunities in safer professions.\nProductivity\u00a0overall of workers doubled in just\u00a0the past 40 years. It\u2019s not just investors or managers who benefit as resources yield more output. Workers share in this abundance of affordable, available and diverse goods.\nOur so-called \"trade deficit\" has largely enabled this boom in newer, more productive jobs. The surplus dollars overseas generated by us importing more than we export flow back to the United States often in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) in businesses here \u2014 exploding more than 500% compared to thirty years ago to\u00a0more than $330 billion last year. If the president succeeds at eliminating this trade deficit, workers employed in these new jobs will suffer as foreign direct dries up.\nEconomic distortion caused by tariffs will shift jobs and resources to industries in which we lack a\u00a0comparative\u00a0economic advantage. As government policies deploy resources to less efficient businesses, more individuals will be forced to take these less desirable jobs.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer poses with Tandy Jeckel, owner of TandyWear, at her flagship store in Commack, Long Island, NY, on Thursday, April 24, 2025. Jeckel is a Trump voter who is unhappy with the raising of tariffs.(Rashid Umar Abbasi for Fox News Digital)\nThe overall decline in business output translates not only to less profit; it yields less take-home pay and consumption for middle-class families. Workers will be harmed by this shift to lower-paying jobs.\nContrast this world of fewer, lower-paying jobs with a competitive environment which ensures that over time, each employee can produce more without working more. Business owners, employees and consumers all benefit. Higher prices on imported goods will not magically make American manufacturers more efficient or innovative. Quite the inverse!\nBy shielding them from competition, these businesses will grow complacent \u2014 with less incentive to improve, cut costs, and deliver better products at lower prices. As productivity declines, the standard of living for workers will also decline.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe ingredients for a flourishing manufacturing sector are lower regulations, lower taxes and more freedom to trade with others. In fact, many jobs returned to the USA after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) because America became more competitive with the rest of the world.\nEmbracing even part of this recipe has created a \"Golden Age\" for the past 40 years. Millions of people who would have previously worked in lower-paying factory jobs, now work in higher-paying, advanced services.\nIn fact, we now export far more of these services than we import. For this reason, the typical American family enjoys an annual income $26,000 greater\u00a0than just one generation ago. A record percentage of young adults are participating in our stronger economy.\nTariffs are a roadblock to prosperity, not a highway.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe overall decline in business output translates not only to less profit; it yields less take-home pay and consumption for middle-class families. Workers will be harmed by this shift to lower-paying jobs.\nWe\u2019ve been here before: Look at the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930. It was meant to protect American industry, but it prolonged the Great Depression by choking global trade. The layoffs, price hikes, financial carnage and cratering approval ratings caused by this historic tax increase may cajole the president into soon relenting.\nIf not,\u00a0the promised manufacturing jobs will come at the expense of jobs elsewhere and be far fewer in number than promised. We will produce less, consume less and earn less.

{"title":"This is how Donald Trump can terminate tariff turmoil","date":1746316800000,"body":"Economist Steve Moore discusses President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policy and the April jobs report on \u2018Fox Report.\u2019\nThis past April has been one of the most volatile months in stock market history, thanks to the Trump administration\u2019s botched rollout of its so-called reciprocal tariff rates. However, this tariff threat has at least succeeded in bringing other nations to the negotiating table \u2013 and now, the best way to restore calm is by letting Trump do what he does best: negotiate.\nThat\u2019s a difficult pill to swallow for businesses likeAmazon, which is addicted to artificially cheap imports from nations like China. Instead of pressuring Chinese vendors to cut costs or force the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the negotiating table, Amazon has been flirting with pressuring the Trump administration to drop the whole tariff fight altogether.\nRecently, for example, officials in the company were debating whether to display a so-called \"tariff cost\" along with the price of items for sale. Amazon called this transparency \u2013 but nothing could be further from the truth.\nAMAZON DENIES TARIFF PRICING PLAN THAT WHITE HOUSE CALLED 'HOSTILE AND POLITICAL'\nFor one thing, where was this \"transparency\" when former presidentJoe Biden\u2019sfour-decade-high inflation caused consumer prices to explode?\nAnecdotally, some products that I used to buy on the site doubled in price during Biden\u2019s tenure. Yet Amazon never dared tell consumers what portion of these price increases was caused by Biden\u2019s overspending.\nSimilarly, when Biden exploded regulatory compliance costs (which also directly impacted consumer prices), Amazon never told consumers how much of their bill at checkout was from overregulation. Folks never saw an \"inflation cost\" or \"regulation cost\" while Biden was president.\nTREASURY SECRETARY BESSENT SIGNALS US ADVANTAGE IN TARIFF BATTLE AS CHINA'S ECONOMY CRUMBLES\nNot only that, but where would Amazon even get the data needed to display the effect of tariffs on the cost of individual items?\nThis information certainly can\u2019t come from Chinese vendors. Anyone attached to the CCP is consistently pressured to lie and publish falsified data.\nIronically, it\u2019s more important that we make these trade deals with China\u2019s key trading partners than with our own. By peeling nations like India, Japan, and Australia out of China\u2019s sphere of influence, Trump can isolate the CCP and force them to their knees.\nInstead, finding information about (for example) the amount China exports requires finding how much every other nation is importing fromChinaand adding those figures. Only then can one gain a better sense of whether the \"official\" CCP data is accurate.\nUnfortunately, even such a painstaking method is imperfect because the CCP can pressure other totalitarian states to either falsify or neglect to publish relevant data. China itself simply stopped publishing unemployment data when the figures got too ugly for the CCP\u2019s liking.\nBUFFETT CRITICIZES TRUMP'S TARIFFS ROLLOUT, SAYS US SHOULDN\u2019T USE 'TRADE AS A WEAPON'\nAmazon has since backed away from the idea of displaying estimated \"tariff costs\" on its site. But even the discussion of such an idea speaks to how spooked markets are about potential tariffs.\nIf PresidentDonald Trumpis not able to make any deals before the end of the 90-day pause, the ensuing tariffs will amount to a massive tax increase on American consumers and foreign producers alike, grinding economic growth to a halt.\nBut Trump failing to negotiate isn\u2019t at all a foregone conclusion. In fact, we\u2019ve recently seen extremely positive developments with key trading partners like India and Japan.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS: COMPANIES THAT WILL INVEST $1B OR MORE IN THE US\nIn other words, there\u2019s plenty of economic runway left (as Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentput it recently), and Trump can still safely land this plane.\nWhat exactly does that look like? In short, it means signing bilateral trade deals with key trading partners to both guarantee American consumers can still access a wide variety of affordable products from abroad and ensure that American exporters can finally access to foreign consumer markets.\nIronically, it\u2019s more important that we make these trade deals with China\u2019s key trading partners than with our own. By peeling nations like India, Japan, and Australia out of China\u2019s sphere of influence, Trump can isolate the CCP and force them to their knees.

{"title":"REP. MIKE KELLY, SEN. TIM SCOTT AND SECRETARY SCOTT TURNER: Save the Opportunity Zones before it\u2019s too late","date":1745971200000,"body":"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nIn 2017, Congress passed one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in the last quarter-century. When President Donald Trump signed theTax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA),the law spurred economic growth the United States hadn\u2019t seen in a generation. Wages increased, and unemployment decreased. Americans were able to cash their paychecks and go home to their families with more money in their pockets.\nNow, eight years later, major TCJA provisions are up for renewal. Among them:Opportunity Zones,a successful, bipartisan piece of legislation that is transforming underserved communities in real time.\u00a0 Opportunity Zones have made an incredible impact across our nation.\nThe Opportunity Zone (OZ) initiative allows investors from all over the United States toinvest their capital gains earningsin economically distressed communities where new investments can be eligible for preferential capital gains tax treatment. Instead of sitting idle in a brokerage or bank account, this money is put to work in communities that have not seen significant private investment for some time.\nGOP PUSH TO MAKE TRUMP\u2019S 2017 TAX CUTS PERMANENT, SAY GOING BACK WOULD BE A \u2018DRAMATIC\u2019 CHANGE FOR MANY\nThis pro-growth tax policy offers crucial incentives that do not cost American taxpayers a single cent. In 2017, this kind of policy may have seemed unbelievable to some within the Beltway. Despite the skepticism, OZs are actively transforming communities and creating economic opportunities for families in the poorest zip codes.\nPresident Donald Trump's Tax Cuts & Jobs Act spurred economic growth.(AP Photo\/Alex Brandon)\nErie, Pennsylvania may best exemplify the economic benefits and the tangible changes Opportunity Zones can create in a relatively short period of time. In 2018, the city\u2019s downtown ZIP code, 16501, was named the poorest in Pennsylvania and among the poorest nationwide. \u00a0However, through the potential of OZs, the stigma of Pennsylvania\u2019s poorest ZIP code served as a springboard for investment in the area.\nShortly after TCJA was signed into law, a group of local residents recognized how Opportunity Zones could revitalize the city. Major employers, local universities and other organizations partnered to provide initial financial backing to form the Erie Downtown Development Corporation (EDDC).\nTo date, EDDC has leveraged more than $115 million in private investment into downtown Erie, which has built 108 new fully occupied residences, revitalized and created more than 100,000 square feet of new commercial space, and established space for 25 new businesses. Overall, $400 million of long-term capital investment is at work, breathing new life into Downtown Erie.\nThese investments have a proven track record of revitalizing small businesses and residential areas while fostering innovation in technology and manufacturing \u2014 an industry where South Carolina excels. Projects like the South Carolina Technology & Aviation Center (SCTAC) have generated over $6.1 billion in investments and created more than 18,000 new jobs in the local community. This further underscores the significance of Opportunity Zones, which have been and will continue to be impactful.\nAdditionally, Opportunity Zones have played a significant role in assisting the revitalization of previously overlooked communities, transforming them into economic powerhouses. In Oconee County, South Carolina, investors transformed a textile mill built in 1875 along Lake Hartwell into 197 new residential apartments. The project also incorporated retail and recreational amenities, including the restoration of the historic dam and the creation of public green spaces and trails.\nNationally, Opportunity Zones have generated$89 billionin private investment across more than 5,600 designated communities, and this investment spurred the creation of over 500,000 jobs in the first two years alone. According to a report released in March by the Economic Innovation Group (EIG), a bipartisan public policy organization based in Washington, D.C. The legislation also has a far-reaching impact \u2014 approximately one in 10 Americans live in an Opportunity Zone.

In the near-term, uncertainty and volatility remain.\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York City on March 28, 2025 amid President Donald Trump's escalating trade war.(Spencer Platt\/Getty Images)\nTrump announced tariffs on April 2, dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The announcement included both a 10% universal baseline tariff and plans to enact larger tariffs on dozens of other countries, including China.\nThese new import taxes immediately sent stock markets into free-fall, triggering one of the largest single-day S&P 500 losses since World War II, and prompting deep and unyielding uncertainty over possible next moves.\n\"The only thing that's happened that has pushed the odds of a recession up so high, so fast, is chaos coming from out of the White House,\" Wolfers said.\nTrump subsequently paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to encourage the administration to make \"deals\" with countries on trade and encourage more investment in U.S. manufacturing. Even so, some prices have already risen in anticipation of higher costs under the new tariff regime.\nUncertainty has also played a role.Trump's tariff announcementin April prompted a number of large container ships to abruptly halt their shipments to the U.S. earlier this month and turn back to their original ports. This means that more consumers will see a price hike for everyday products, likely at certain big-box retailer stores like Walmart or Target, as early as next month.\nThese price hikes are \"not showing up tomorrow, but will show up over the next few months, as scarcities develop and American retailers have to find other sources \u2013 that might take a while,\" David H.

However, for every dollar bill that goes to China, the U.S. gets something for it that Americans want to buy, like T-shirts.\n\"We have a dollar deficit \u2013 but we have a stuff surplus.\"\nThere are few signs thatTrump's tariffswill deliver the gains he sought, such as onshoring U.S. production or securing better trade deals, particularly with Asian countries.\nInstead, experts warn these countries are likely to circumvent U.S. markets and supply chains over time.\n\"If these tariffs stay in place, there will be hardly any trade between the U.S. and China,\" by the second half of the year, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview.\nRoughly $650 billion in annual trade between the two countries is at risk, along with knock-down effects on global commerce in the long term.\nWORLD LEADERS REACT AS TRUMP RE-ENTERS THE WHITE HOUSE\nPresident Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping\nTrump's tariffs also discard decades of international understanding that has depoliticized trade disputes, Feldman said.\nThe U.S. is \"moving from a system that at least was based on mutually acceptable rules of behavior to a system that does not have that as its anchor,\" Feldman, whose research focuses on global trade policy, told Fox News Digital.

Only the higher tariff will be applied to car manufacturers, not a combined tariff.\nThe announcement is the latest of Trump walking back, pausing or easing tariffs as he looks to even the trade playing field for the U.S., while encouraging U.S. manufacturing and job creation. Industries that manufacture products on U.S. soil do not face any tariffs.\nA White House official who spoke to Fox News Digital explained that while the past few months of tariff changes might seem chaotic in their entirety, each change was born out of a need to be flexible and an effort to bring manufacturing and jobs into the U.S. while ending the nation's chronic trade deficit.

A day later, after speaking with auto industry officials from Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, Trump walked back the tariffs if they affected the auto industry, granting a one-month exemption to tariffs \"on any autos\" from the two countries that abide by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement's rules of origin.\nThose rules were established under the first Trump administration, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a \u00a0news conference at the time.\nPresident Donald Trump(Andrew Harnik\/Getty Images)\nOn March 6, Trump again walked back the 25% tariffs on many imports from Canada and Mexico while praising Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for helping secure the U.S.-Mexico border.

At the same time, Trump is knifing the policies that actuallyhadbeen revitalizing American manufacturing, like Biden\u2019s bipartisan China competitiveness law and the Inflation Reduction Act.\nTrump\u2019s broken promises and self-inflicted economic losses don\u2019t end there. He and congressional Republicans are plotting Medicaid and Affordable Care Act cuts. Trump let the richest man in the world cutSocial Security benefits. Trump\u2019s also slashing the investments that are the lifeblood of our technological and medical innovation edges. All of this is to make room for the tax cuts for the rich that his tariff taxes finance.\nAnd even though the rule of law, American courts, and the independence of the Federal Reserve are critical to keeping the United States as the top economy in the world, Trump is eroding all of those pillars. He\u2019s even raging against judges and other leaders he himself nominated, includingSupreme Courtjustices, law enforcement officials, andFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\nTaken together, Trump is weakening our economy so profoundly that he\u2019s setting-off the deadliest exodus of investment away from America since the 1940s.

The liberal media, which has underestimated and misrepresented this president for the past decade, would have us believe that his second term so far has been a disaster. Many of us who voted for Trump disagree.\nPollsters tell us that Trump\u2019s approval ratings are in free fall. Critics (and the president) suggest some polls don\u2019t pass the smell test. GOP pollster John McLaughlin reports that in the new NY Times\/Siena poll, which showed Trump with a meager 42% approving of how the president is handling his job, only 37% of the survey group voted for Trump in 2024.\nThe recent ABC\/Washington Post poll showed Trump at 39% approval \u2013 \"The Lowest in 80 Years\" blared a headline \u2013 but included, according to McLaughlin, only 34% Trump voters.

Economists tell us that prices are set to soar, the U.S. is likely to tumble into recession, a \"supply shock is coming\" and thatthe dollar is under attack.\nNever mind that inflation has eased over the past two months and actually turned negative in March. \u00a0Never mind that the jobs market remains solid and that Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently told Bret Baier on Fox News that \"consumers are still spending.\"\nThe end is near, we are told, all because Trump is attempting something that should have happened a decade or two ago: he is trying to make America competitive again. He is trying to undo the damage done by allowing China to join the World Trade Organization, looking the other way while China broke everyrule meant to promote fair trade(Thank you Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama.) and by a series of trade agreements that allowed U.S. companies to ship jobs overseas.\nThe liberal media\u2019s take on Trump\u2019s tariff battle is relentlessly and universally negative. Isn\u2019t there anyone who worries that the U.S. is dependent on Chinese industry and pharmaceuticals? Isn\u2019t anyone irate that America\u2019s EU allies put 10% tariffs on U.S. autos while we impose only a 2.5% tariff on BMWs and Volvos? Does anyone see any upside at all to the Trump trade agenda?\nWhy yes, it turns out that possibly a great many people agree with the president\u2019s actions. Pollster Frank Luntz convened a group of some 15 Trump voters recently, taking their pulse on the rocky past few weeks and expecting them to blast their elected leader, especially on tariffs and the stock market downturn.\nLuntz seemed surprised to find out that the Trump voters remained solidly in the president\u2019s camp. On predicted tariff-generated price hikes, they said they were willing to pay more for goods made in the U.S. and supported trying to bring home production. On the stock market, they observed that markets go up and down, and that there had been corrections even under President Joe Biden.\nOverall, the group appeared willing to give Trump time to work through his agenda, noting that it was only a few months into his term, and that he had three and a half years to go.\nThat is certainly not the view of the liberal press, which has fought Trump every step of his political journey. Whether it was pushing our NATO allies to up their defense spending or calling out China for breaking trade rules and stealing our intellectual property, or advocating for a border wall, the establishment fought him until voters took his side.\nThe end is near, we are told, all because Trump is attempting something that should have happened a decade or two ago: he is trying to make America competitive again.\nTrump does not have much time. Since he can serve for only four years, and since he might lose the GOP majority in Congress in less than two years, he entered the Oval Office moving at what is now called Trump Speed on a host of initiatives. He is giving Democrats heartburn by tackling so many ambitions at once.\nOf 31 main campaign promises, even The Washington Post has had to acknowledge that he has made progress on all but eight, and that summary is dishonest. Of the eight described as \"Hasn\u2019t Happened,\" the promise to \"cut taxes\" and \"eliminate taxes on tips and overtime\" is clearly \"underway\" (another category) as Congress works toward a reconciliation bill.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe Post points out that numerous initiatives face \"roadblocks,\" with judges stepping in to deny progress on ending birthright citizenship and cutting funds to sanctuary cities; some of these proposals will succeed, others will not. Trump supporters will cut him some slack for not being able to overcome judicial interference.\nBut they will also applaud those promises that Trump is quickly moving to fulfill: expanding oil and gas production, rolling back destructive environmental regulations, eliminating offensive race and gender curriculms in schools, preventing girls from having to compete in sports with biological males and drastically reducing the flow of people entering our country illegally.\nThese policies offend the liberal establishment, but that isn\u2019t the group that elected Trump. Working-class, common-sense Americans voted for Donald Trump and for the most part I\u2019m guessing that \u2013 like the Luntz sample \u2013 they like what he is doing.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFor sure, because the president has taken on such a boatload of initiatives, mistakes have been made. The roll-out of the tariff program, in particular, was choppy and has created uncertainty. But if the White House can ink deals with India, Japan and South Korea in the next month or so, those wins will calm markets and cheer voters.\nTrump should continue to deliver on his campaign promises. \u00a0The polling will take care of itself\u2026 and become great again.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE LIZ PEEK","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/liz-peek-ignore-biased-polls-trump-voters-love-his-first-100-days","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":1,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":0,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

At the American Bankers Association\u2019s Washington Summit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent notably said, \"for the next four years, the Trump agenda is focused on Main Street.It\u2019s Main Street\u2019s turn.It\u2019s Main Street\u2019s turn to hire workers.

Now, he needs to make time to hear the concerns of small businesses. FILE: Afternoon sunlight shines on the historic core of downtown Independence.(iStock)\nSmall business is big businessfor America, which is why it is often referred to as the backbone of the U.S. economy. Per Small Business Administration statistics, there are nearly 35 million small businesses, compared to less than 20,000 big businesses. Small businesses account for around half of the private economy and create the majority of new jobs.\nHowever, as small businesses are spread out across geographies, demographics, industries and sizes, they don\u2019t garner as much attention in Washington. There are fantastic individual advocates as well as advocacy organizations like NFIB (National Federation of Independent Business), the S Corporation Association, the NSBA (National Small Business Association), the SBE Council (Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council) and many industry-specific organizations, among others, that should receive as many invitations to economic discussions as the bigger players.\nSmall businesses have been shouldering the fallout of government mandates for half a decade. First, state and local COVID-19 mandates shut down and negatively impacted millions of small businesses, for which the poorly designed PPP program did not fully compensate.\nOn the back of the COVID mandates, long-term disruptions occurred to supply chains and labor markets which further hurt small businesses. Then, historic inflation under the Biden administration put even more pressure on small businesses and their customers.\nWhile small companies were optimistic for theMain Street-first Trump administration,expecting deregulation and tax certainty to help boost their business growth, millions of small businesses are instead fighting yet another government-imposed battle with tariffs.\nWhether a small business has part or all of their supply chain abroad, has domestic suppliers with exposure to foreign supply chains or customers cutting back on spending and investment due to market and economic uncertainty, they are being hurt financially.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAnd while big companies like Apple were granted a temporary clawback in their tariff exposure, decreasing China-sourced tariffs for smartphones, computers and chips from 145% to 20%, millions of small businesses did not receive any relief. Apple has tens of billions of dollars in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet; small businesses do not have such balance sheet leverage.\nWhile understanding the needs of companies like Apple and Walmart is important, it is just as important to understand the needs of small companies throughout the country.\nSmall businesses have been shouldering the fallout of government mandates for half a decade. First, state and local COVID-19 mandates shut down and negatively impacted millions of small businesses, for which the poorly designed PPP program did not fully compensate.\nSmall businesses do not have the ability to absorb massive costs due to major overnight policy changes.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn fact, almost all small businesses that I speak with want very little from the government except to be left to do their business without government interference. They want to exist on the same playing field as everyone else and not have government-imposed barriers, regulations and challenges put in their path at every turn.\nTo understand these challenges, President Trump should invite more small businesses and their advocates to the White House. If Main Street is going to thrive, it needs to start with small businesses, and that reality should grant small businesses a seat at the table.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CAROL ROTH\nCarol Roth is a former investment banker, entrepreneur and author of the new book\"You Will Own Nothing\"Broadside Books.

It\u2019s like being a little kid in abig crazy familywatching the grown-ups have a nasty, screaming\u00a0fight\u00a0in front of the neighbors. It\u2019s embarrassing. But it\u2019s more than that. This big crazy family\u00a0needs the neighbors \u2013 which includes everyone in the world who participates in our financial system \u2013 more than ever.\nThere\u2019s probably not much\u00a0we\u00a0can do about the\u00a0fight. The grown-ups clearly don\u2019t care much about us kids \u2013 if they did, they\u2019d quit\u00a0fighting\u00a0and figure all this out.

(Drew Angerer\/Getty Images)\nBehind all the details there is one huge problem: the grown-ups are bad with money. Real bad. The last several presidents\u00a0and Congresses, have racked up something like $37 trillion in debt, most of it owed to the people watching in horror as the\u00a0fight\u00a0over the Fed gets\u00a0ugly. As more\u00a0and more of them conclude this is a badly dysfunctional family \u2013 something already on every neighbor\u2019s minds \u2013 it\u2019s going to be harder\u00a0and more expensive to finance all that debt.\nTRUMP SLAMS JEROME POWELL AS 'MR. TOO LATE,' CALLS FED CHAIRMAN A 'MAJOR LOSER'\nAs you would expect, there\u2019s a political part of the\u00a0fight. Trump\u00a0thinks Powell\u00a0has just one job, which is to do whatever\u00a0Trump\u00a0tells him to do. But that\u2019s wrong. TheFederal Reserveis created by Congress. Powell\u00a0is supposed to do what Congress tells him to do.\u00a0And right there in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 225a Congress has ordered the Fed to promote\u00a0\"maximum employment, stable prices,\u00a0and moderate long-term interest rates.\"\nThat seems clear enough until you turn to Section 10, where Congress tells the president he has the duty to appoint the chair of the Fed. Trump\u00a0claims that this must mean he also has the power to fire the chair.\nIf this was a simple power struggle, it wouldn\u2019t matter all that much. But Trump\u00a0alsostarted\u00a0an\u00a0economic\u00a0fightin January when, in his inauguration speech, he promised to \"overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers\u00a0and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries,\u00a0we\u00a0will tariff\u00a0and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\"\nAMERICA CAN RETURN TO FISCAL SANITY WITH STRONG FEDERAL RESERVE LEADERSHIP AND TRUMP BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE\nSo far Trump\u00a0has been inconsistent in honoring that promise. On April 2 he\u00a0announced his massive \"liberation day\" tariffs. On April 9, he suspended the tariffs. He said China was a big problem that required the U.S. to imposemassive new tariffs. Then he suspended those tariffs on electronic goods.\nYou might think that if the president is talking\u00a0and not doing, things can\u2019t go too badly. Maybe his advisors are keeping him from doing\u00a0any real harm.\nIf only.\nIn fact, the uncertainty is almost worse. Businesses can\u2019t brace themselves for one threat, they must worry about them all.\nTRUMP CRANKS UP HEAT ON FED CHAIR WHILE PRESSING FOR RATE CUT: 'POWELL\u2019S TERMINATION CANNOT COME FAST ENOUGH!'\nPowell\u00a0is in\u00a0an\u00a0even tougher spot. His mandate \u2013low inflationand low unemployment \u2013 are tough enough without a president who thinks he can \"overhaul our trade system.\" It\u2019s nearly impossible with a president who keeps changing his mind about how to do it.\nThis whole thing is especially\u00a0annoying to\u00a0economists.\u00a0We\u00a0can see the damage already being done when\u00a0we\u00a0look at the bad stuff happening in\u00a0bond\u00a0and currency markets.\u00a0And\u00a0we\u00a0know there\u2019s\u00a0an\u00a0easy solution: put a computer in charge of the Fed.\nSeriously. Fire\u00a0Powell, tell\u00a0Trump\u00a0he\u2019s got\u00a0an\u00a0early tee time\u00a0and then program a few simple rules into a computer.

And if there\u2019s one place on Earth where showmanship reigns supreme, it\u2019s\u00a0Las\u00a0Vegas.\nBut\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0didn\u2019t build a hotel in\u00a0Vegas\u00a0to learn how to count cards or win at slots. He\u2019s built many hotels.\u00a0What\u00a0he picked up in\u00a0Las\u00a0Vegas\u00a0was the magician\u2019s most powerful tool:\u00a0misdirection. The ability to distract the crowd with one hand while pulling off the real magic with the other.\nAnd right now? He\u2019s\u00a0using that same strategy toget things done for America\u2013 whether you love him or loathe him.\u00a0And those who loathe him have a hard time separating the man from his policies.

Misdirection is the art of drawing your opponent\u2019s attention one way, while the real play is happening elsewhere. It\u2019s how a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat. It's how\u00a0Trump\u00a0has always played politics \u2013 and he's back on center stage.\n10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER\nHere are three ways\u00a0Trump\u00a0is\u00a0using magician misdirection right now:\n1. Tariff Hype, But The Real Tariffs Were Aimed At China\nEveryone\u2019s shouting\u00a0about\u00a0Trump\u2019s 10% tariff on all countries \u2013 calling it reckless, inflationary and a new trade war in disguise. But while the mainstream media fixates on the headlines,\u00a0Trump\u2019s real play is something else entirely: Sending awarning message to Chinaand reviving good old American manufacturing.\nConsider\u00a0Trump's tactics.\u00a0Announce a policy.\u00a0Change a policy.\u00a0Announce a policy. Change a policy.\nPart of being a master negotiator is to never let your opponent get balanced footing. In the end of this massive flurry of tariff talks the\u00a0last two weeks, the real tariff hit China the hardest at 145%, sending the ultimate message that we won\u2019t tolerate manipulative tactics from China.\nHERE'S WHAT TRUMP IS REALLY UP TO WITH HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBIT\nWhile behind closed doors, the\u00a0Trump\u00a0team is simultaneously working with economic advisors to roll out a broader industrial plan \u2013 one focused on bringing critical supply chains home, incentivizing American-made goods and loosening our dangerous reliance on China. The tariff talk? That\u2019s just the spark. The fire iseconomic independence.\n2. Tariff Revenue, Tax Talks\nAmid all the tariff scuttlebutt, most Americans are forgetting that right around the corner looms one of thelargest tax discussionsin American history. President\u00a0Trump\u00a0signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, and those very tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025.\nOne of the big initial questions is, how we are going to pay for the tax cuts to continue and for\u00a0what\u00a0was promised on the campaign, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits.\nAccording to a study,\u00a0President\u00a0Trump\u2019s tariff plan\u00a0(as of April 8, 2025) is projected to raise significant revenue \u2013 over $5.2 trillion over 10 years on a \"strict conventional\" basis and $4.2 trillion on a \"partially dynamic\" basis commonly\u00a0used with\u00a0tariffs. This revenue\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0used to reduce federal debt, thereby encouraging private investment.\nHOW THE SENATE AND HOUSE FIND $2 TRILLION\nInstead, while most of the public-facing discussion in the media has been\u00a0abouttrade imbalancesor resurrecting fairness of trade around the world so the United States doesn\u2019t get taken advantage of anymore, this is a master magician move by\u00a0President\u00a0Trump\u00a0as I predict he will\u00a0use these tariffs revenues as a bargaining chip for a new tax plan that will move corporate tax rates to 15%, fulfill part of the \"no tax\" promises made on the campaign trail, and create tax cuts for millions of middle-class families in America.\u00a0It\u2019s just that nobody is talking\u00a0about\u00a0it right now.\n3. It\u2019s\u00a0Not\u00a0A Nobel Prize, It\u2019s The Noble Cause\nFrom Ukraine toGaza, and with growing tensions between Taiwan and China, global instability is on the rise. Some suggest that Trump\u2019s goal in stopping these wars is selfishly to win a Nobel Peace Prize.\nBut while\u00a0President\u00a0Joe Biden tried to walk a tightrope, hoping to please both progressives and defense hawks,\u00a0Trump\u00a0is pushing a simple message:\u00a0peace through energy, economic strength, and keeping our enemies off balance.\u00a0If you don\u2019t comply, \"there will be hell to pay.\"\nWe don\u2019t always know\u00a0what\u00a0President\u00a0Trump\u2019s real goal is in this magic trick. Take over Greenland?\u00a0Canada as the 51st\u00a0state? Gulf of America? Mineral deals withUkraine?\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIf you don\u2019t watch the sleight of hand,\u00a0what\u00a0he\u2019s calling for is a return to full-scale American energy dominance \u2013 through oil, gas, nuclear and even clean coal \u2013 to take power back from rogue nations like Iran and Russia.\nWhile critics scream \"isolationism,\"\u00a0Trump\u00a0may just be pulling off the ultimate trick by crafting a platform of\u00a0controlled strength\u00a0that aims to keep America out of wars by making\u00a0sure\u00a0no one wants to pick a fight in the first place.\u00a0How would that be for a grand\u00a0finale?\nAtlantic City and\u00a0Las\u00a0Vegas\u00a0may have taught Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0that if you want to win the game, you don\u2019t just play your hand \u2013 you control where everyone\u2019s looking.

Republicans are no longer the party of the \"wealthy.\" Manual laborers, shop and storekeepers and small business persons now comprise Trump\u2019s GOP.

Pritzker, D-Ill., gives his take on President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff strategy and more on \u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019\nA month before the 2024 election,Elon Musk tweeted, \"Trump now leading Kamala by 3% in betting markets. More accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line.\"\nThese markets were correct. Also correct is Musk\u2019s assessment of these markets. When people stake their own money, they do so with as much solid information and rational foresight as possible.\nThis fact is a big reason why PresidentDonald Trumpshould reverse his tariff policy. Financial markets are driven by people investing their own money in anticipation of future economic conditions, and these markets are screaming that the president\u2019s tariffs will inflict enormous harm on America\u2019s economy.\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 10, 2025, a day after announcing a 90-day pause on \"reciprocal\" tariffs, with the exception of China.(Anna Moneymaker\/Getty Images)\nFrom the time of Trump\u2019s April 2 release of his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs until his April 9\u00a0announcement of a 90-day pause in most of these duties, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 11% of its value. The S&P 500 dropped by 12% and the NASDAQ by 13%. These massive declines occurred in a mere six days. Then when investors learned of his tariff pause, the sell-off stopped. Much, though not all, of these losses were recovered.\n10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER\nIf the tariffs were truly likely to restructureAmerica\u2019s economyin a way that, as Trump promises, will \"make us very rich and very strong,\" the tariff announcement would have immediately had Wall Street overrun with bulls. They would have ignored any short-term economic disruptions caused by the tariffs. Focused on the bright future, the bulls would have immediately driven share prices upward.\nBut instead, financial markets tanked as they were mauled by bears \u2013 revealing that people in the know and spending their own money anticipated that the economic damage from these tariffs won\u2019t be temporary. It will be lasting.\nThen the bulls appeared in force as soon as the president announced his 90-day pause. There\u2019s no better evidence that investors with their eyes on the future are convinced that these tariffs are economically destructive.\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t they be destructive?\nRIGHT STARTS TO SOUND LIKE THE LEFT ON TARIFFS: THAT'S NOT AMERICA FIRST\nBy raising the prices of consumer goods, tariffs shrink families\u2019 purchasing power.\nBy protecting producers from competition,businesses becomeless entrepreneurial and innovative. The economy\u2019s dynamism diminishes.\nFurther, because\u00a0more than 61%\u00a0of U.S. imports are raw materials and intermediate goods used as inputs by producers in America, tariffs jack up American firms\u2019 costs of production. Covering these higher costs by raising the prices of their outputs, these firms not only sell less at home, their exports become less competitive globally. As firms sell and export less, they lay off workers.\nAnd several foreign governments retaliate by raising their own tariffs. This retaliation further reduces the market for U.S. exports.\nUnfortunately, the tariffs\u2019 economic carnage doesn\u2019t end there. By dampening the American economy\u2019s competitiveness and dynamism, tariffs incite global investors to retreat from the U.S.\nI OWN A CORVETTE DEALERSHIP AND I\u2019VE ALREADY SEEN THE BENEFIT OF TRUMP\u2019S TARIFFS\nGlobal investment brings capital to our shores and lowers our interest rates. Much of this capital funds the opening of new businesses, the expansion and improvement of existing businesses, and research and development as well as worker training.\nThese investments raise U.S. GDP. More importantly, they increase American workers\u2019 productivity. And increased worker productivity is utterly necessary if real wages are to rise and Americans\u2019 living standards to continue to improve.\nAnd so as the tariffs prod global investors to flee the U.S., American workers will, over time, find themselves less well-trained, and employed in workplaces that are less productive. Americans\u2019 incomes will shrink.\nThis retreat of global investors from America will, ironically, achieve one of Trump\u2019s main goals: smallerU.S. trade deficits. The president believes that these deficits are evidence that other countries are cheating America and\u00a0ripping us off.\nNETWORKS GO FULL NEGATIVE SPIN OVER TARIFF TURBULENCE, STEER CLEAR OF GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS\nBut the president is mistaken. America runs trade deficits because foreigners are especially eager to invest in America. Just as you can\u2019t spend all of your dollars onconsumption goodsif you want to invest, foreigners can\u2019t spend all of their dollars on American exports if they want to invest in America.\nDollars that foreigners don\u2019t spend on American exports raise U.S. trade deficits. But those same dollars are invested in America, causing the U.S. to run capital-accountsurpluses\u2013 meaning, a net inflow of investment to our shores.\nBecause no one invests in places believed to be in economic decline, the now half-century-long run of U.S. trade deficits proves that investors worldwide have immense confidence in America\u2019s economy. We shouldn\u2019t be pestered by having built a globally attractive economy. We should be proud.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAnd just as a company grows by attracting more investment, so does America\u2019s economy grow by attracting more investment.\nFar from U.S. trade deficits signaling Americans being ripped off, theseinvestment inflowsare foreigners\u2019 contributions to the health and growth of America\u2019s economy.

{"title":"New study about IRS reveals just how much Trump tax cuts saved you","date":1744848000000,"body":"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses Republican efforts on Capitol Hill to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s tax policy and more on \u2018Special Report.\u2019\nIn Washington, facts are often the first casualty of politics. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the debate over the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s signature tax reform law from his first term in office. As debates rage whether to extend the TCJA\u2019s individual tax cuts, left-wing politicians and legacy media outlets are ramping up their usual misinformation campaign.\nWe\u2019ve all heard the talking points: The TCJA was a\u00a0\"wealth transfer\" that came \"at the expense of working families,\"\u00a0a\u00a0\"giveaway to billionaires,\"\u00a0or my personal favorite, a\u00a0\"reverse Robin Hood\"\u00a0scheme to rob the working class for the benefit of the ultra-wealthy.\nThere\u2019s just one problem: none of that is true. Not even close.\nTAX TIPS: LAST-MINUTE ADVICE FROM EXPERTS AS TAX DAY NEARS\nEarlier in April, I co-authored a new policy study for The Heartland Institute examining the latest IRS personal income tax data. Our goal was to determine if the Republican tax law is still saving taxpayers money, and if so, how much?\nTrump can point to the success of his tax-cut strategy in aiding the middle class, according to a new study.\nWhat we found is that lower- and middle-income Americans have received the largest tax breaks due to the TCJA \u2014 and these are not small amounts, either. We estimate tens of millions of filers have saved thousands of dollars because of the Republicans\u2019 tax reform law, savings that are now at riskshould Congress fail to extendthe cuts before they expire at the end of 2025.\nThe evidence is clear, compelling and impossible to ignore \u2014 unless you\u2019re a partisan activist masquerading as a journalist.\nUsing government data, we were able to calculatehow much in taxesthe average filer in each IRS income bracket paid annually from 2017 to 2022. TCJA was passed into law in 2017 but didn\u2019t go into effect until 2018. By comparing the data from 2017 to later years, we can determine the effect of the tax cuts on individuals and families.\nThe IRS data shows that every income bracket received a tax cut because of the TCJA, but the taxpayers who received the biggest cuts, in terms of percentage saved, went to those who earned less than $75,000.\nFor example, the average filer in the IRS\u2019s \"$40,000 under $50,000\" bracket paid 18.8% less in taxes in 2022 than they did in 2017.\nSimilarly, the tax bill for filers in the \"$50,000 under $75,000\" bracket was 16.5% less in 2022 than it was in 2017.\nFor comparison, those earning between $5 million and $10 million paid 2.3% less over the same period. So much for the \"billionaire tax cut\" narrative. (You can find data for other income brackets in our published paper, which is availablehere.)\nSome critics of the TCJA have claimed that although middle-income Americans received large cuts to their tax rates, those tax rate reductions didn\u2019t amount to significant savings in terms of total dollars. But these assertions are also false. Many middle-class Americans have saved thousands because of the TCJA.\nA new analysis of IRS tax data indicates that everyone benefited from the Trump tax cuts, but those who earned less than $75,000 received a much-higher percentage of savings.(Samuel Corum\/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nOur analysis found from 2018 to 2022, filers earning between $50,000 and $75,000 annually saved an average of $4,516 because of the personal tax cuts contained in the TCJA. For those in the $75,000 to $100,000 bracket, the savings jumped to $5,923. And those earning $100,000 to $200,000 saved an astonishing $9,638 over five years.\nThese numbers do not tell the full story, however. Because the most recent IRS data available is from 2022, total savings estimates do not include the numbers from 2023 and 2024. To account for these years, we developed projected figures using the average amounts saved in 2018 to 2022.\nAfter extending the analysis through 2024 using consistent annual trends, the numbers become even more impressive. In 2022, more than 50 million middle-class filers fell into brackets that saved on average between $6,322 and $13,494 in total savings.\nEven lower-income and working-class Americans saw substantial relief. We estimate that households making between $30,000 and $50,000 saved $2,537 to $3,833 over the same period.\nIronically, the very law Democrats call a boon for the rich has made the U.S. tax code more progressive. We came to this conclusion by examining the tax burden paid by each IRS income bracket in 2017, the year before TCJA went into effect, compared to their burdens in subsequent years.\nWhat we found is that in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available, every income bracket earning less than $200,000 paid a smaller share of the total personal income tax burden than they did in 2017. Conversely, every bracket above $200,000 paid a greater share.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThat means that although every income group received a tax cut because of the TCJA,the Trump tax cutscaused wealthier filers to pay for a bigger chunk of the personal tax revenue pie than they did in previous years, the exact opposite of what Democrats frequently claim.\nIf Congress does nothing, the TCJA\u2019s personal income tax cuts will expire at the end of 2025. That means tens of millions of Americans will face a stealth tax hike. For many middle-income families, it could mean paying $900 or more in taxes annually.\nAfter extending the analysis through 2024 using consistent annual trends, the numbers become even more impressive.\nWashington elites might not feel it, but working families sure will.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThat\u2019s why this fight matters. This isn\u2019t about President Donald Trump or partisan point-scoring \u2014 it\u2019s about whether the government should take more from families already struggling under the weight of inflation and stagnant wages.\nThe data is in. The verdict is clear. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked \u2014 for everyone, but especially for working-class and middle-income Americans. It\u2019s time to tell the truth about the tax cuts, and then make them permanent.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINS\nJustin Haskins is a New York Times bestselling author and a senior fellow at The Heartland Institute and Our Republic.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/new-study-about-irs-reveals-just-how-much-trump-tax-cuts-saved-you","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":0,"topic_crypto":0}

{"title":"House prices skyrocketed under Biden. Now, guess who Democrats want to blame?","date":1744761600000,"body":"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nDemocrats love blaming high home priceson everything but their own policies.\nOver the past five years, the cost of a median house has risen 20% nationally while wages rose just 4% \u2014 and that disparity doesn\u2019t even account for increased mortgage rates.\nWithhousing costs becoming a massive painpoint for millions of American households, it\u2019s easy to see why Democrats want to avoid taking responsibility (and blame Republicans if possible).\nDIY EXPERT SHARES TIPS AND GADGETS FOR SPRING CLEANING\nSome, like Nevada Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen, have taken aim at President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies. In a\u00a0recent letter\u00a0to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, she warned that Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canadian lumber would \"drastically increase the cost ofconstructing housing in the United States.\"\nHouse prices shot up during the Biden years and wages didn't come close to keeping up.(iStock)\nLike many economists, I\u2019m no fan of tariffs, but in this case, Rosen\u2019s concern is nothing more than political posturing. For one thing,\u00a0Biden actually increased\u00a0tariffs on Canadian lumber and received very little backlash from his own party.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that lumber prices alone have a relatively small impact on the cost of home construction (and shouldn\u2019t affect the price of existing homes at all).\nOne analysis by the\u00a0National Association of Homebuilders\u00a0(which advocates for low tariffs on construction materials) found that framing is the single most expensive part of building a new house, accounting for 15.5% of the final construction cost. But when you consider framing as a share of the home\u2019s sales price (which is what buyers actually care about) and try to separate out labor costs, lumber accounts for a much smaller percentage \u2014 perhaps as low as 4%. The current tariff on Canadian lumber is\u00a014.5%.\nCrunch those numbers, and it seems like wood tariffs drive up the cost of a median home by\u00a0a few hundred dollars\u00a0at most. That\u2019s not nothing, but it doesn\u2019t come close to explaining how home prices got so out of control.\nAnother Democratic line of attack, best exemplified by anexchangebetween JD Vance and podcast host Lulu Garcia-Navarro, has focused on immigration policy.\n\"So how do you propose to build all the housing necessary that we need in this country by removing all the people who are working in construction?,\" Garcia-Navarro asked the then-candidate for vice president.\n\"Well, I think it\u2019s a fair question because we know that back in the 1960s, when we had very low levels of illegal immigration, Americans didn\u2019t build houses,\" Vance answered, sarcastically.\nIt\u2019s true that non-citizens disproportionately work in construction (though not all construction workers build homes), but it\u2019s also true that they compete with citizens for scarce housing. Even the libertarian Cato Institute\u00a0acknowledges\u00a0that \"the marginal immigrant increases housing demand more than he increases housing supply.\" This means that, on the whole, less illegal immigration and more deportations will mean cheaper housing.\nDemocrats have tried to blame President Donald Trump for the spike in house prices. But President Joe Biden's administration was responsible. (Photo by TING SHEN\/AFP via Getty Images)\nThough, of course, the entire issue is a red herring, since the massive wave of illegal immigration under President Joe Biden coincided with a spike in housing costs. Even if it were true that tight border controls and strict immigration enforcement would make homes\u00a0more\u00a0expensive, it wouldn\u2019t explain how they got so expensive in the first place.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nPerhaps most absurdly, Democrats and the Biden administration even tried to blame\u00a0landlords\u2019 greed and the pricing algorithms they use. The Biden\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0sued\u00a0one of these algorithms\u00a0to \"make housing more affordable for millions of people across the country,\" and Democrats in Congress have proposed similar legislation to end the use of this software.\u00a0This is ridiculous.\u00a0An empty apartment is a huge financial hit for a landlord. That is exactly what happens when they price their units too high \u2014\u00a0they are left holding them back.\nFortunately, while Democrats continue to scapegoat and point fingers, Republicans are aiming to fix the housing cost inflation problem with deregulation.\nThis means that, on the whole, less illegal immigration and more deportations will mean cheaper housing.\nFor example,\u00a0under\u00a0newly confirmed Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner, the Trump administration is working to cut red tape that many builders say has held back new construction.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nTurner has announced a comprehensive review of HUD\u2019s programs. Of course, much of the red tape is state or local, but there are plenty of federal barriers that can be deconstructed as well, and that is exactly what the Trump administration plans on doing.That\u2019s a step in the right direction, which is far more than what the Democrats are currently offering. Hopefully, it\u2019s the first of many similar initiatives to come. Housing is a great populist issue that can provide endless political wins for the White House\u00a0\u2014\u00a0so the more, the merrier.\nJohn Schuler is an economist and assistant professor in Computational and Data Sciences at George Mason University.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/house-prices-skyrocketed-under-biden-now-guess-who-democrats-want-blame","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":0,"topic_crypto":0}

We\u2019ve spent 13 weeks in session, including the longest continuous period of session in 15 years, and the Senate has taken more votes at this point than in any other Congress since at least the Reagan era.\nWe have a lot to show for it.\u00a0We confirmed the president\u2019s Cabinet at the fastest pace in more than 20 years, despite Democratic obstruction, and we are building out the rest of PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s team at a brisk pace. As of this week, the Senate has confirmed more than 50 Trump nominees, including a new FBI director, a new chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and several ambassadors to key postings abroad.\nAnd confirmations are far\u00a0from\u00a0the only thing we\u2019ve done. We passed Sen. Katie Britt\u2019s, R-Ala., Laken Riley Act, which ensures that illegal immigrants who steal, assault a law enforcement officer, or kill or seriously injure another person are detained instead of being allowed back out on the street.

The Senate has so far passed seven Congressional Review Act resolutions to roll back Biden rules.\u00a0Among other things, we\u2019ve repealed theBiden administration\u2019s tax on natural gas, taken action to protect Americans\u2019 financial freedom, and repealed burdensome mandates on household appliances that got caught up in the Biden administration\u2019s climate agenda.\n10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER\nImportantly, we\u2019ve also laid the groundwork for a permanent extension of the2017 tax reliefand a transformational investment in our border, energy and national security.

Yes, the party that mere months ago was making plans to destroy the filibuster \u2013 a key Senate rule that today helps preserve the Founders\u2019 vision of the Senate \u2013 is now using it repeatedly.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nDemocrats have filibustered legislation to keep biological men out of women\u2019s sports, protect babies born alive after botched abortions, and sanction the rogue International Criminal Court, which is targeting Israeli\u00a0leaders today and has a history of targeting American citizens.\nWith as much as we\u2019ve already accomplished, there\u2019s a lot more work to be done, and we\u2019ll continue to keep our foot on the gas. There are appropriations bills to consider, more burdensome regulations to repeal, and work to be done to complete the final bill that will deliver on our promises on taxes,border security, strengthening our military, unleashing American energy, and getting our country on a more sustainable fiscal path.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThere are also more nominations to consider, and the Senate will continue to keep up a brisk pace. If Democrats decide to obstruct nominees, that isn\u2019t going to mean we slow down; it means we are going to keep senators here longer to get these confirmations done. If that means late nights or weekends, so be it. As I said to my Democrat colleagues, we can do these nominations the easy way or the hard way.\u00a0 But one way or another we are going to get them done.\nIt\u2019s been a busy 100 days in theUnited States Senate, and I\u2019m looking forward to delivering more results for the American people as Senate Republicans, House Republicans, and the White House continue to work together to advance our shared agenda.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

Trump will serve as the \"final decision maker\" of the negotiations, and he is \"very invested\" in securing the best trade deals for the U.S., the admin official said.\n'DEAL-MAKER-IN-CHIEF': BEHIND THE SCENES OF TRUMP'S TARIFF PAUSE, WHERE HE HAS FINAL SAY OVER NEGOTIATIONS\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event on energy production in the East Room of the White House on Tuesday, April 8, 2025 in Washington.(AP Photo\/Evan Vucci)\n\"The American people elected President Trump because he's a deal-maker, and he's going to be thedeal-maker-in-chiefto make this happen,\" the source said.\nSCOTT BESSENT SAYS UP TO 70 NATIONS WANT TO NEGOTIATE OVER TRUMP'S TARIFFS\nTariffs are expected to be a focal point of the week as Democrats continue lobbing attacks at Trump over the duty taxes and pausing the customized tariffs on the same day they took effect.\nPresident Donald Trump, right, and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele shake hands as they hold a meeting in New York, on Sept. 25, 2019 on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.(SAUL LOEB\/AFP via Getty Images)\nOn Monday, Trump will meet withEl Salvador President Nayib Bukeleat the White House. Bukele has emerged as a key ally to the administration regarding immigration policies, including by accepting illegal immigrants of anynationality facing deportationin the U.S. and booking them into El Salvador's notorious prison system. Those deported to El Salvador from the U.S. have suspected ties to vicious gangs, such as Tren de Aragua or MS-13.\nEl Salvador's CECOT prison is known as the nation's most notorious prison. The prison, which can hold 40,000 inmates, was built to house gang members in a country that held one of the highest murder rates in the world before violence dropped in recent history. Prisoners at CECOT are blocked from receiving visitors and can only attend hearings virtually, while the prison itself blocks any cell signal to ensure gang members cannot contact criminals still on the street, various media reports have detailed.\nEL SALVADOR TAKES IN HUNDREDS OF VENEZUELAN GANG MEMBERS FROM US, EVEN AS JUDGE MOVES TO BLOCK DEPORTATIONS\n\"Looking forward to seeing President Bukele, of El Salvador, on Monday! Our Nations are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity,\" Trump posted to Truth Social on Saturday, confirming the meeting this week.\n\"President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation\u2019s custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States. These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency'sElon Musk, as well as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, both previewed that the \"Trump Gold Card\" would be operational in the coming days. Trump explained earlier this year that the U.S. would offer a $5 million card that grants foreigners the ability to live and work in the U.S., as well as a path to citizenship.\nTRUMP VOWS TO REFUND, DEPORT ANY 'UNSAVORY' IMMIGRANTS WHO TRY FOR CITIZENSHIP UNDER POTENTIAL 'GOLD CARD'\n\"We\u2019re going to be selling a gold card,\" Trump said from the Oval Office back in February. \"You have a green card. This is a gold card. We\u2019re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million and that\u2019s going to give you green card privileges, plus it\u2019s going to be a route to citizenship. And wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card.\"\n\"[I'm] working with Howard [Lutnick] to get that, the Trump gold card, operational hopefully in the next week or so,\" Musk said during a Cabinet meeting with Trump last week.\n\"That'll be very exciting,\"Trump responded. \"That's a pathway to citizenship into the United States.\"\nPresident Donald Trump, left, and Elon Musk in attendance during UFC 314 at Kaseya Center in Miami on April 12, 2025.(\u00a0Sam Navarro-Imagn Images)\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nTrump is kicking off his 13th week back in the Oval Office with a clean bill of health after White House physician Capt.

Eventually, more people came around to the mistakes and promised this would not happen again.\nToday, embedded in the discourse around tariffs, we are seeing many of the same behaviors and language. But staggeringly, it is many on the right that are standing on the wrong side of freedom.\nThere are, no doubt, myriad fiscal issues plaguing the U.S. today.\nAN AMBITIOUS TRADE DEAL WITH INDIA IS IN OUR GRASP\nTheBiden administrationleft the Trump administration a giant fiscal mess. After Biden propped up growth with massive deficit spending, our U.S. debt\/GDP grew to north of 120%. Our deficit\/GDP in the 6-7% range is now that of a country at war. Our spending on interest to service our debt exceeds U.S. defense spending, which is a massive warning sign. Biden\u2019s historic inflation remains difficult to combat.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s options are limited given all the above, current interest rates, massive financing and refinancing of debt that needs to happen this year and other factors.\nHowever, tariffs are unlikely to work as a tactic to solve the above.\nTRUMP RISKS IT ALL, TAKES ON THE WORLD WITH TARIFFS AND PUTS AMERICA FIRST\nIn the panic of \"do something,\" many Trump supporters are sacrificing principles, sounding more like the left then purveyors of conservative values.\nSmall businesses who bore the brunt of theCOVID mandates, their after-effects and inflation, are now at risk again. Those who have part or all of their supply chain abroad are going to have a hard time surviving if this goes on much longer and they are not exempted from tariffs.\nI have heard over and over again on social media that those businesses don\u2019t deserve to exist, basically the same thing that I wrote about in \"The War on Small Business\" after COVID, when the left told small businesses they needed to close for \"the greater good\" as they defined it.\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT TARIFFS AND THE HISTORY LESSON MANY CRITICS ARE MISSING\nThat\u2019s not freedom or America first \u2013 that\u2019s central planning garbage.\nMoreover, most of those spewing rhetoric don\u2019t realize that small businesses that have part of their business abroad is stillAmerica first. Small businesses in the U.S. exploit comparative advantages in the supply chain. The same businesses often have personnel in design, marketing, sales, administration and other functions in the U.S. that create American jobs.\nThey may sell all over the globe, getting desired products not just to Americans, but to citizens of other countries as well. When those foreign citizens buy the products, they are supporting American jobs and sending their capital to the U.S. Those profits are invested and spent, often in America.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nTelling these businesses not to exist in support of \"the greater good\" is communist-type thinking.\nMoreover, if millions of thesesmall businessesgo under, not only will those jobs, profits and capital be removed from America, it is likely a foreign company or a massive corporation will pick up the opportunity and benefit.\nThat is not America first.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWe have many issues to solve economically, but most of those have been caused by moving away from freedom and capitalism.

I witnessed firsthand the near collapse of my business during the tumultuous years of 2021-24.\nCrippled by COVID-19, supply chain disruptions, and unfair trade practices the previous administration neglected or even encouraged, my story mirrors the broader struggle of American industry. However, the Trump administration's 2025 tariff strategy, a \"stratified gambit,\" triggered a dramatic and unexpected turnaround.\nTRUMP'S TARIFF PAUSE THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF HIS PRAGMATISM ON THE POLITICAL STAGE\nIn the game of bridge, a \"stratified gambit\" is a strategic play where players are grouped at different levels, or \"strata,\" competing against those in their tier yet still part of a larger tournament. It's a layered competition that allows different skill levels to coexist, compete and win in their own way based on the player's strategy.\nRetired autoworker Brian Pannebecker, from Detroit, speaks alongside President Donald Trump as he delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs during an event in the Rose Garden entitled \"Make America Wealthy Again\" at the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 2, 2025.(Brendan Smialowski\/AFP via Getty Images)\nToday, this is precisely what's happening with the American economy under theTrump administration's strategic use of tariffs. It\u2019s a multi-tiered economic gambit aimed at restoring trade balance, boosting national production and providing the forgotten American businesses and workers with a fighting chance.\nAnd that\u2019s all we ask for: For our own government to give us that fighting chance.\nUnlike conventional trade policies, Trump's tariff rollout was meticulously planned and layered, providing American industries vital time to adjust and reshore without facing immediate retaliatory shocks. This strategy signaled a decisive shift away from \"America last\" policies, prioritizing fair trade and bolstering domestic production.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAgainst the backdrop of dire media predictions, Corvette Warehouse has experienced a remarkable surge in sales and renewed customer confidence. Consumers, driven by both financial and patriotic motivations, began \"buying American again.\" The tariffs effectively corrected longstanding trade imbalances, addressing years of outsourcing and currency manipulation that had eroded American industry. We\u2019ve seen our best week in nearly 36 months.\nAlongside advocacy for strategic, temporary trade protections, the tariffs serve to rectify market failures and unfair global competition. Coupled with potential interest rate reductions by theFederal Reserve, this strategy aims to stimulate domestic growth and alleviate the national debt. Yes, the Trump administration has \"paused\" the customized reciprocal tariffs, but the message is already coming through loud and clear.\nThe shift is palpable in the used-car market, with a notable increase in demand for American-made vehicles and trade-ins of foreign brands. This reflects a growing wave of economic patriotism, where consumers actively prioritize American-made goods. This is exactly what we need to bring jobs back home and rebuild American industry.\nNow, America needs further fiscal prudence, includingreduced government spendingand enhanced efficiency, to maximize the benefits of the tariff strategy. This is not isolationism but a strategic move toward balanced trade that supports American workers and businesses.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhat\u2019s coming next isa tangible revival of American industry. We must have strategic thinking and real-world experience in navigating the complex economic challenges ahead. Trump\u2019s \"stratified gambit\" is unfolding, and it\u2019s the right approach, reshaping the economic landscape and empowering American producers and consumers.\nPresident Trump is giving America the fighting chance we need.

Vietnam simply doesn't have the economy or the resources to import from the United States and to\u2026 provide that reciprocity,\" Kapadia explained.\nVietnam charges the U.S. a 90% tariff on imported goods to the nation. The Trump administration last week announced the Southeast Asian country will face a46% tariff on goods importedto the U.S.\nVietnam's industries are also deeply rooted in Chinese business investments, Kapadia said.\nMUSK SAYS HE HOPES FOR 'ZERO TARIFFS,' FREEDOM OF TRADE ZONE BETWEEN US AND EUROPE\n\"To add insult to injury, they also have been a hot bed for Chinese investment. Since the imposition of the Section 301 tariffs under the first Trump administration, which were these large-scale tariffs on Chinese imports, you had a whole number of Chinese companies across a variety of industries in the consumer product segment basically invest, instead, in factories in Vietnam as a way to circumvent paying tariffs, so the Chinese would keep their market share, but just go and make it in another country,\" he explained.\nChinese President Xi Jinping, left, and Vietnam President To Lam pass by an honor guard at a welcoming ceremony at the Great Hall of the People on Aug. 19, 2024 in Beijing.(Andres Martinez Casares-Pool\/Getty Images)\nTrump signed a memo under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 in 2018 under his first administration targeting Chinese goods for U.S. tariffs in response to Chinese theft of American intellectual property, Trump said at the time.\n\"This was by far the worst day for the Vietnamese government, in the sense, they're realizing that that door has now closed. A 46% tariff \u2013 Vietnam is not an attractive country to import from.

Kappadia said the newest upcoming tariff and the \"high-band\" tariffs of 45% on some Chinese goods puts the country's tariff barrier at about 75% to 80%, which Kapadia predicted could grow to 150% by the end of 2025.\n\"That's because there's just a lot of ongoing challenges with China that have not begun to kind of roll-out or get resolved, and ultimately the United States is going to have to continue to pressure U.S. companies to invest more in the United States, and the only way to do that is to continue to put pressure on China,\" Kapadia said.\nThe trade expert continued that other nations, particularly European export sectors, could also see fallout from the tariff plan in regard to luxury products or household purchases, but that it's too early to predict where the chips will fall with Europe.\n\"I think that that might resolve itself over time, depending upon how the Europeans behave. From what we've seen, just early next week, we're going to have some dignitaries and officials from Europe come and visit the president to negotiate on a potential resolution. All in the meanwhile, they are threatening a retaliatory 20% tariff to kind of make this tit-for-tat based on the reciprocal tariff announcement, but we know from the president that all that's going to do is turn the 20% that we put on Europe to 40%,\" he said.\nKapadia pointed to India and Japan as the two nations that will benefit from Trump's tariff plan last week.\nHERE\u2019S A CLOSER LOOK AT TRUMP\u2019S TARIFF PLAN: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW DUTIES\n\"We have seen both the Japanese head of state and the Indian head of state come to Washington and provide the president with opportunities where they would then reduce their own tariff barriers,\" he said.\n\"Just a week before this announcement, Prime Minister Modi came out and provided a whole list to the government\u2026 that says, 'Here are all the things that I'm going to reduce, in terms of tariffs of U.S. exports to India' And so I think that's going to continue. And I think that they're going to make headway at getting toward more equitable trade between the two countries,\" he added.\nTrump unveiled a 27% tariff on India on \"Liberation Day\" and a 24% tariff on Japan.\nPresident Donald Trump and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Feb. 13, 2025.(Photo\/Alex Brandon)\n\"I think that they're going to make headway at getting toward more equitable trade between the two countries, whether that's India and the U.S. or Japan and the U.S., and honestly serves to the U.S.' benefit to rectify some of those tariff barriers with India,\" he said. \"It is the largest democratic country in the world, and they are strategic ally for geopolitical reasons and a number of other considerations. And so they're going to be a country that I think we have to watch and really see how they negotiate their way through this new tariff regime.\"\nKapadia pointed to a handful of U.S. companies that operate in India, such as Lego, Apple and Goldman Sachs, and predicted companies that have made large-scale investments in India will likely stay there, while they will likely move other overseas operations in nations facing even higher tariffs, such as Vietnam, to India.\nTRUMP TOUTS RETURN OF \u2018AMERICAN DREAM\u2019 IN HISTORIC TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENT\n\"You name it, a whole slew of U.S. companies have made concerted, large-scale investments in India. I think that they're going to stick to them. I think they're going to grow there. And if you look at the difference, just on our arbitrage basis, 46% versus 26% \u2013 that's a big Delta. So if you're Apple, and you're making Apple technology, Apple-related products in Vietnam, and you're importing at 46%, or you're making it in India at 26%, you're obviously going to double down on your India effort,\" he said.\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in the Oval Office of the White House on Feb. 7, 2025.(Jim Watson\/AFP via Getty Images)\nKapadia continued that Trump's latest tariff policies target corporate America, which opens the doors to which industries will move back to U.S. soil to avoid the tariffs. He pointed to \"critical industries\" such as semiconductor manufacturing, critical minerals, aluminum and steel manufacturing delivering large-scale investments in the U.S. both this year and next year, to increase capacity and production \"out of necessity.\" He noted that Trump's customized reciprocal tariffs are not stackable with existing tariffs on certain industry imports, such as steel and aluminum.\nHERE'S WHAT HAPPENED DURING TRUMP'S 11TH WEEK IN OFFICE\n\"That's going to be the opportunity for the jobs to be created, for the investment to happen.

{"title":"SEN RAND PAUL: Terminate the Trump tariffs before it's too late","date":1743724800000,"body":"President Donald Trump predicts US will ultimately flourish and 'boom' because of his tariffs plan.\nIf you think eggs are expensive, just wait until the new tariffs hit cars. Goldman Sachs\u00a0estimates tariffs on imported vehicles could raise prices by $5,000 to $15,000. That\u2019s because tariffs are taxes on foreign imports that are paid by American consumers. These tariffs apply to almost every conceivable product. As a result, energy will be more expensive, andgas pricesin some parts of the country could see as much as a 70-cent increase in the cost per gallon. According to the National Association of Home Builders, the\u00a0building of a single-family home could become up to $10,000 more expensive because of the tariffs. With the tariffs on aluminum, even beer and hard seltzer are likely to increase in price.\nUnfortunately, these tax increases are on top ofthe taxesyou have already paid when tariffs were imposed during the first Trump administration. The Tax Foundation calculated that tariffs between 2018 and 2023 imposed an additional $1,753 in costs on American families. Now that the tariffs apply to even more products, the tax increases are poised to be even higher this time. The Peterson Institute predicts tariffs could annually cost families $1,200 a year, while Yale\u2019s Budget Lab estimates the tariffs would cost the average American family $4,200 annually.\nThe fact that tariffs are taxes paid by consumers is not news to the American people. That is why vehicle sales\u00a0jumped almost 13% \u00a0last month as Americans sought to make their purchases before the 25% tariffs on motor vehicles and parts went into effect.\nVICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE SAYS TRUMP IS 'TAKING THIS ECONOMY IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION'\nConservatives used to publicly acknowledge that tariffs are taxes paid by Americans. Milton Friedman stated plainly that tariffs \"raise prices to customers and waste our resources.\" Ronald Reagan similarly opposed protectionism because it \"costs consumers billions of dollars, damages the overall economy, and destroys jobs.\"\nBut the actions of those who now advocate for tariffs acknowledge the damage tariffs cause, even if their words do not. Recently, the Secretary of Agriculture\u00a0indicated the administration was preparing programs to mitigate \"economic catastrophes\" for farmers harmed by tariffs\u2014a clear admission that tariffs hurt Americans. The firstTrump administrationauthorized $28 billion in farmer bailouts to offset financial losses caused by tariffs. Do Americans expect to get hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars back from the government to pay for their increased costs caused by the tariffs? Of course not.\nTariffs are not just bad for American families and the national economy; tariffs are also bad for Republicans.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nTariffs have been electoral disasters for Republicans.\u00a0The McKinley Tariff of 1890 caused such a spike in prices that theRepublican Partylost nearly 100 seats in the House and by the end of the next election, the House, Senate, and White House were all in Democratic hands.\nWhen the House passed the Smoot-Hawley tariff on May 28, 1929, stock prices in New York fell in June. Senate passage of the Smoot-Hawley tariff on March 24, 1930, triggered a dramatic fall in stock prices.And, on June 17, 1930, President Herbert Hoover signed the bill into law, the stock market plummeted even farther.\nThe 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariff worsened the Great Depression and wiped out the Republican Party. By 1933, Republicans lost over 100 seats in the House as well as their majorities in both chambers of Congress.\nEven seniority and power could not save the tariff\u2019s authors and president who signed it into law the next time they faced the voters. Oregon Republican Congressman WillisHawley, who served 26 years in the House, was not renominated to return to his seat. After serving five terms in the Senate, RepublicanSenator Reed Smoot,of Utah, was defeated in 1932.

{"title":"Biden\u2019s leftover regulations will decide your next light bulb unless Trump stops them","date":1743724800000,"body":"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nAmericans have shown a real dislike for the wave offederal regulations targeting home appliances.Even more infuriating is the fact that our tax dollars bankroll this unwanted agenda. It is time to pull the plug on those inside and outside the government who make a living micromanaging our appliance choices.\nA threatened regulatory crackdown on\u00a0gas stoves\u00a0in 2023 sparked a surprisingly strong public backlash, but it did not deterBiden administration regulatorsfrom going after\u00a0nearly every other home appliance,\u00a0including washing machines, refrigerators, furnaces, dishwashers, air conditioners, light bulbs and water heaters.\nMost of these rules are from the Department of Energy (DOE), specifically its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). That office has an annual budget north of $3 billion and a staff of hundreds, about a quarter of which is devoted to energy efficiency.\nGOP LAWMAKERS UNLEASH PROPOSAL TO REVERSE BIDEN'S 'ILL-INFORMED' POLICIES CRIPPLING CRUCIAL INDUSTRY\nJust about every clich\u00e9 there is for a bureaucracy run amok \u2013 moving back the goalposts, mission creep etc. \u2013 is true in spades for EERE and its energy efficiency regulations. Many appliances have been subjected to three, four, or even five rounds of successively tighter energy efficiency regulations over the years, with no end in sight.\nThe Biden administration's war on home appliances featured a campaign against gas stoves. (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson\/Getty Images)\nAt this point, it is not unusual for regulations to substantially boost the up-front cost of an appliance, in some cases more than is likely to be earned back in the form of energy savings.\u00a0 Nor is it out of the ordinary for standards to compromise appliance choice, features, performance, or reliability in the single-minded obsession with forcing less energy use.\nTo take but one example, EERE regulated traditional incandescent light bulbs off the market by imposing a series of efficiency regulations they cannot meet. Taking their place over the last decade have been light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, which are more efficient and can meet the standards but cost more and are not to everyone\u2019s liking.\nTo be fair, the initial assault on incandescent bulbs was required under a\u00a02007 statute,\u00a0but as usual the regulators have now gone beyond any legal requirements. The most recent light bulb regulation, published last April, is\u00a0so strict\u00a0that most currently available LEDs can\u2019t comply either, and average prices will rise from $2.98 to an agency-estimated $5.68.\u00a0Keep those candles handy.\nEven worse are regulations that compromise appliance performance, such as the\u00a0dishwasher regulations\u00a0that have doubled the time it takes to do a load from about an hour in pre-standards models to more than two today. Rather than try to fix the problems with existing dishwasher regulations, the Biden DOE came out with yet another set of incrementally tighter energy and water use limits \u2013 its fifth overall.\nClimate change became the Biden administration\u2019s all-purpose rationale for further tightening the screws on appliances. This explains the efforts to use these regulations to discourage appliances that run on natural gas, a fossil fuel. Beyond stoves, other appliances that come in both electric and natural gas versions, such as furnaces and water heaters, now face costly regulations designed to tilt the market away from gas. In the case of furnaces, the additional cost of a compliant gas model could be as high as\u00a0$867, the agency estimates.\nAssisting the federal regulators inside the government is an army of activists outside of it who also make a nice living \u2013 partially at taxpayer expense \u2013 off the appliance game. This includes organizations that focus primarily on appliance regulations as well as big environmental groups that cover appliance efficiency along with many other green causes.\nFor example, the Rocky Mountain Institute, which remains at the forefront of the efforts to ban gas stoves, has no less than\u00a0six federal agencies\u00a0contributing part of its $139 million dollar annual budget.\nSeveral of these groups have recently received extra cash pursuant to the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Even some manufacturers have been showered with IRA giveaways stretching into the\u00a0tens of millions of dollars each\u00a0to make appliances favored by this agenda.\nStacey Abrams is part of Rewiring America, which received $2 billion from the Biden administration.(CBS)\nPolitical favoritism appears to play a role in deciding who gets these handouts. For example, Democrat Stacey Abrams, after twice losing the Georgia governor\u2019s race, moved on to a leadership position at an environmental organization called Rewiring America that is active in this space.\nIn particular, Rewiring America is pushing hard to eliminate natural gas appliances and make homes completely dependent on electricity. And now, the organization is part of a new coalition named Power Forward Communities that received a whopping\u00a0$2 billion dollar IRA grant\u00a0last April.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThese organizations can be counted on to fight for tougher appliance regulations. Several regularly submit comments to DOE in support of measures they want and against ones they don\u2019t, and some also sit on agency advisory committees that help fashion new rules. Many also push for state and local building code changes that favor their preferred appliance choices, and they now have\u00a0millions in IRA grants\u00a0to help stack the deck in their favor. These activities may not necessarily be illegal, but it is doubtful taxpayers would approve.\nIn addition, many green groups are involved in a never-ending stream of lawsuits against DOE, always on the side of more appliance red tape and often with the government paying attorneys\u2019 fees. Expect these litigants to pull out all the stops against any Trump administration reform efforts, as they did\u00a0during the first Trump administration.\nAssisting the federal regulators inside the government is an army of activists outside of it who also make a nice living \u2013 partially at taxpayer expense \u2013 off the appliance game.\nBottom line \u2013 homeowners\u2019 tax dollars are going to organizations that push for unwanted appliance meddling. Fortunately,President Donald Trumpis\u00a0reconsidering\u00a0many of the regulations, and the Department of Government Efficiency is looking for ways to stem further harmful outlays under the IRA. Congress is also targeting some specific appliance rules\u00a0for repeal\u00a0under the Congressional Review Act.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBut ultimately, the underlying laws must be changed. First, Congress needs to sunset EERE\u2019s appliance regulatory program and the government bureaucracy that lives off it. Just as important, Congress should defund all the organizations that have grown around this program, including blocking the IRA dollars not yet spent.\nNeither the appliance bureaucrats nor their activist allies have the support of the American people. Both should stop getting our money.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM BEN LIEBERMAN\nBen Lieberman is a senior fellow who specializes in environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/bidens-leftover-regulations-decide-your-next-light-bulb-unless-trump-stops-them","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":0,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

Deep down, they\u2019re fighting fora shot at an American Dreamthat now feels more like a mirage.\nWhether it\u2019s United Auto Workers leaning into PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s message of \"Make America Great Again\" or Chicago public school educators digging into their pockets to buy supplies for vulnerable students, the working class represents an electorate long ignored by Washington.\nBoth Democrats and the Trump-informed Republican Party claim to champion workers, but working-class families nationwide still lack real, consistent representation in the halls of power.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, President Donald Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer(Getty Images)\nI\u2019ve seen it up close \u2013 alongside educators, higher education faculty, healthcare workers and public employees. I\u2019ve also listened to factory workers, grocery clerks, long-haul drivers and warehouse staff. Whether in a union hall in the Rust Belt, a hospital in the Sunbelt, or a classroom in Detroit, the message is the same:working people feel unheardand undervalued.\nTHE SURPRISING WAY TRUMP CAN UNLEASH AMERICA\u2019S ECONOMIC COMEBACK\nLabor unions, often demonized by big business and political operatives, are the sum of their parts: everyday working people striving for better.\nThat includes cafeteria workers who kept schoolchildren fed during the pandemic, even when schools were closed; hospital technicians pulling overnight shifts so patients receive care; sanitation crews braving winter storms to keep cities clean; and adjunct professors educating future leaders while barely scraping by. These Americans come together not for power or profit but for dignity \u2013 fighting for better pay, safer conditions and a stable life.\nBut this isn\u2019t just about unions. Millions of workers \u2013unionized or not\u2013 are exhausted, underpaid and navigating broken systems. Yet, they remain the backbone of our economy. In fact, consumer spending by working\u2013 and middle-class families accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. economic activity \u2013 a staggering figure that underscores how deeply labor and livelihoods are tied to the nation\u2019s financial health.\nNEW DEMS READY TO MOVE PARTY AND COUNTRY BEYOND TRUMP CHAOS\nEducators, from kindergarten teachers to adjunct professors, are still paid less than their peers in other fields while facing burnout. Healthcare workers are stretched thin in understaffed facilities. Public employees are asked to do more with less. Meanwhile, private-sector workerscontinue to face job insecurity, outsourcing and wage stagnation.\nThough working-class voters across much of the South and Midwest helped send Donald Trump back to the White House, they also voted pretty clearly on the issues \u2013 including higher wages, paid leave, public schools and reproductive rights.\nOn a recent visit to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania \u2013 and at town halls across the country \u2013 I saw and heard the same thing: people are tired. Tired of broken promises. Tired of political theater. Tired of seeing their lives used as props during elections, only to be forgotten once the votes are counted.\nThe most powerful stories don\u2019t come from podiums. They come from the nurses in North Carolina who are marching to the state Capitol to demand safer staffing. They also come from the stadium workers in Detroit who haven\u2019t taken a sick day in years because missing a paycheck could mean missing rent.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThese aren\u2019t abstract issues. They\u2019re daily realities. And the people living them deserve more than lip service. Their perseverance, sacrifice and quiet acts of love should be at thecenter of our political conversations.\nIt\u2019s time leaders started listening \u2013 not just during campaigns but always. The working class isn\u2019t asking for much, just respect, a living wage, good schools, affordable healthcare and a dignified life.\nThat shouldn\u2019t be too much to ask in the wealthiest country in the world. And yet, here we are.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe results of Missouri\u2019s 2024 ballot measures, loudly and clearly, said what the people wanted. But too often, lawmakers choose special interests over the public interest.\nEven with poll after poll showing American support for neighborhood public schools, members of Congress are pushing a national school choice bill that would drain public dollars into private institutions. If we want to rebuild trust in our democracy, we have to listen to the people who keep it running. The ones who teach, heal, build and serve. The people in red hats and blue T-shirts who, despite the noise, are more united than we think.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM RICHARD FOWLER\nRichard Fowler is a contributor to FOX News Media and an adjunct professor of journalism at Georgetown University.

As a result, this has siphoned auto manufacturers' resources away from gas-powered vehicle production and toward EV production, ultimately pushing the costs of gas-powered cars higher, according a report by the AEI.\nIf auto manufacturers do not produce enough EVs to meet state and federal standards, they are forced to buy into a credit system to offset their emissions production, inevitably creating another avenue where additional costs are transferred to consumers, according to the report.\nGOP LAWMAKER SEEKS TO SLAM BRAKES ON BIDEN'S \u2018WOKE AND WASTEFUL\u2019 EV TAX CREDIT\nUtility costs also see an impact, AEI's report points out. State and federal subsidy and rebate programs for EV charging infrastructure, while beneficial for utility companies' profits, lead once more to increased costs that are subsequently passed on to rate payers. Forty states offer rebates for in-home level two chargers, while at the federal level, rebate and subsidy programs for EV charging infrastructure received an investment of roughly $7.5 billion under formerPresident Joe Biden.\n\"By distorting the market with regulatory credits, subsidies, and behind-the-scenes rulemaking, federal agencies are shifting costs from affluent EV buyers to working-class Americans \u2014 while straining a grid that\u2019s already under pressure,\" said Jason Isaac, co-author of the report and the founder and CEO of AEI. \"This isn\u2019t about consumer choice or energy innovation. It\u2019s administrative overreach that leaves Americans paying more to drive and to keep the lights on.\"\nIsaac, a formerTexas state representative, admitted that during his time in the legislature, he worked to create an EV subsidy in the Lone Star State, which provided all EV buyers with a $2,500 tax credit. He said that over time, he realized the majority of fully electric vehicles were being purchased by wealthier individuals who, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, would have done so even without the subsidies.\n\"This policy is not a home run,\"saidHunt Allcott, a professor of environmental social sciences and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, with regard to the federal EV tax credit system. \"While the [Inflation Reduction Act's] electric vehicle tax credits have slowed climate change and shifted production to U.S. manufacturing firms, they also impose high costs on U.S. taxpayers.\"\nTOP AGENCY STAFFER TRYING TO BLOCK CRUCIAL TRUMP DIRECTIVE ONCE MANAGED DEI TEAM\nEach EV that's purchased benefits from an estimated $94,000 to $153,000 in hidden subsidies over a 10-year period, according to research from the AEI. These figures account for the costsautomakersbear to meet government mandates as well as losses from forced EV production, expenses that ultimately raise prices for consumers.\nA Tesla charges at an electric vehicle charging station in New York.\nRebates and subsidies for EV charging infrastructure are driving up base utility rates for consumers as well, the AEI report states. It is estimated that if each EV sold resulted in one in-home or commercial charging infrastructure, the more than 1.1 million EVs sold in 2023 would have received more than $827 million in residential charging tax credits.\nIsaac said these rebates and subsidies are then used by utility companies to lobby public utility commissions to approve higher base rates because they are enhancing their infrastructure to improveEV infrastructure.\n\"When you go buy a gallon of gasoline, [taxpayers] are not helping you pay for that gallon of gasoline; all the costs are embedded within a gallon of gasoline,\" Isaac said. \"So the typical EV charge, whatever they pay at the charging station, is only a small portion of the expenses. That charging station itself has received a significant subsidy, both from the state and the federal government, and the utility has come in and increased the infrastructure or improved, enhanced the infrastructure to handle that load, and the rate payers in that particular area are picking up that burden.\"\nDEMOCRATS TURN ON TESLA DESPITE YEARS-LONG ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH\n\"Eliminating these costly EV mandates is exactly the kind of action needed under President Trump\u2019s energy emergency,\" says American Energy Institute's Jason Isaac. \"It would jump-start a resurgence in the American auto industry, lower the price of new vehicles and ease pressure on our electric grid, bringing down energy costs for every household.\"(AP\/Getty\/Fox)\nOne anecdote used in the report to illustrate the cost burden of EV charging subsidies and rebates posits that if one homeowner were to purchase anEV chargeron a street of 10 people, and the local electric company provides that homeowner with a $500 rebate, the downhill impacts lead to each of the 10 households shouldering a roughly $50 cost to build the charger as a result of the subsidized rate increases.\nThe increased costs on gas-powered car buyers and utility rate payers, Isaac said, illustrates the need to get rid of these clean-air mandates.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Eliminating these costly EV mandates is exactly the kind of action needed under President Trump\u2019s energy emergency,\" Isaac said. \"It would jump-start a resurgence in the American auto industry, lower the price of new vehicles and ease pressure on our electric grid, bringing down energy costs for every household.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to several EV advocacy groups, including Drive Change.

{"title":"EU tariff threats are crushing craft whiskey distillers like me","date":1743292800000,"body":"United Refining Company Chairman John Catsimatidis joins \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 to discuss the impact President Donald Trump\u2019s latest tariffs on countries buying oil and gas from Venezuela could have on global trade.\nAmerica\u2019s proud history as one of theworld\u2019s top whiskey-producing nationsis in grave danger from the trade war between the U.S. and European Union. If it wasn\u2019t enough for Canada to rip our products off shelves, the EU\u2019s threat of 50% tariffs on American whiskey, set to take effect\u00a0on April 13, now jeopardizes decades of progress and market expansion in Europe.\nPresident Donald Trump is right:We must trade with the worldin a fair and reciprocal manner. That\u2019s a model that has served the spirits industry well for decades. Small whiskey distillers like me are now counting on the president to strike a deal to ensure zero-for-zero tariffs on American whiskey, starting with the EU.\nMuch is at stake, including jobs,local agriculture and centuries of progress and pride in our craft. So ingrained is whiskey in American history that George Washington himself became a major distiller of rye whiskey after his presidency. But never has our legacy as a nation of distillers been as robust as it is today.\nSTOCKS RISE AFTER TRUMP TEASES 'NICER' TARIFF POLICY\nIn the past 20 years, an explosion of distilleries nationwide \u2014 from 50 in 2005 to more than 3,000 today \u2014 has taken the variety and reputation of American whiskey to new heights, expanding this subtle art to small towns such as Swisher, Iowa, where I operate my family-owned craft distillery. From these communities, our distinctive products have earned an international fanbase.\nJeff Quint is founder and CEO of Cedar Ridge Distillery in Swisher, Iowa, and producer of Cedar Ridge Iowa Bourbon.\nChief among those distinctive products is bourbon, which by definition can be distilled in any state in America, not just Kentucky. American whiskeys, such as bourbon, were exported from 37 states in 2024. In recent years, bourbon has become a sensation in foreign countries, earning a place alongside other national categories like scotch (a distinctive product of Scotland) and tequila (a distinctive product of Mexico).\nThese international markets are essential for the growth of small distilleries. Here in the U.S., there is only so much bourbon we can sell. A 50% tariff on bourbon in the EU would hike prices sharply and curb demand just as it is taking off. Many American distilleries will be forced to stop exporting, which could lead to bourbon overcapacity in America.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nI have experienced the sting of tariffs firsthand. In 2016, my craft distillery \u2014 Cedar Ridge \u2014 started the arduous but exciting process of establishing our brand in the EU. It takes three to five years to find foreign distribution partners, promote your brand and fight for shelf space in a new market before you see a dime of real profit.\nWe were devastated when, in 2018, just as we were getting our sea legs in Europe, the EU retaliated against U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs with a 25% tariff on American whiskey. Our business became collateral damage in a trade dispute that had nothing to do with us. The choice was either to raise our prices to cover the tariffs, eat the cost ourselves and take the loss, or pull out of the market entirely. We made the painful decision to pull out, as did many others.\nAt the time, the EU was the largest American whiskey export market. But between 2018 and 2021, our exports plunged 20%, from $552 million to $440 million. The EU suspended its tariffs in 2021, enabling exports to surge back even higher \u2014 to $699 million last year. But many small distilleries like mine stayed out of the market due to uncertainty over whether these tariffs would be reimposed.\nThat uncertainty is kryptonite for a small business. It leaves us paralyzed, unable to embark on a three-to-five-year investment journey when we know the rug could be pulled out at any moment. This hurts not just our family and our 65 employees, but the local Iowa farms we buy our grains from, the American manufacturers who make our barrels and bottles, and the other downstream industries that support us.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWe\u2019re counting on this administration to fight for us and restore certainty in our trade relationships, first with the EU before the\u00a0April 13\u00a0deadline, and then in Canada and other crucial markets.\u00a0There are also many markets where we do not have fair and reciprocal trade, and we hope that the Trump administration will open those doors for our great American products.\nOn the line is nothing less than America\u2019s whiskey legacy \u2014 centuries old and aged to perfection.\nJeff Quint is founder and CEO of Cedar Ridge Distillery in Swisher, Iowa, the producer of Cedar Ridge Iowa bourbon.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/eu-tariff-threats-crushing-craft-whiskey-distillers-like-me","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":0,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

In Oregon, a state with aggressive climate goals, the Department of Transportation has anticipated that it will face an estimated $350 million budget shortfall due in part to declining gas tax revenues. California, which requires auto manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles, is looking at a potential loss of $5 billion \u2013 or 64% \u2013 over the next decade, according to analysts.\nJason Isaac is the founder and CEO of the American Energy Institute, a trade organization representing mainly oil and gas companies. He told Fox News Digital that states are losing about $2,506 in gas tax revenue per every EV sold. Isaac said that, in his view, strict EV mandates are exacerbating the dearth in gas tax revenues.\nDOGE LAWMAKERS LOOK TO DEFUND BIDEN'S ANEMIC-PACED $3B EV POSTAL TRUCK \u2018BOONDOGGLE\u2019\n\"Theregulations and requirements from the federal governmentfor automobile manufacturers to make and sell electric vehicles is having a profound impact on revenue collection for states and the federal government to fund our highway infrastructure,\" Isaac said.\n(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\/Minnesota Department of Transportation)\nIn particular, he pointed to clean air fuel economy requirements.\n\"Automobile manufacturers are all losing billions of dollars making EVs. The only company that's making money selling EVs is Tesla, and they're making money because they're selling fuel emissions credits to other automobile manufacturers,\" Isaac said. \"Tesla would just break even, maybe a little bit of profit, if it wasn't for the selling of the credits to Ford and GM, Stellantis, and other automobile manufacturers that are forced to buy fuel economy credits because of requirements from the federal government.\"\nAs a result, Isaac said, gas-powered car manufacturers are compelled to make moreelectric vehiclesin an effort to keep up with government mandates.\n\"It's really destroying the market,\" he said.\nEPA ADMINISTRATOR ROLLS BACK 31 BIDEN-ERA REGULATIONS\nHummer EVs are seen on the production line as former President Joe Biden tours the General Motors 'Factory ZERO' electric vehicle assembly plant, in Detroit, Michigan, on Nov. 17, 2021.(Reuters\/Jonathan Ernst\/File Photo)\nMeanwhile, Isaac posited, fuel economy mandates and the ongoing credit-buy-back system have generated a \"multi-billion dollar market out of nothing that's not improving fuel economy.\"\n\"There\u2019s bipartisan support to get rid of these credits,\" he said, adding that the move would help auto manufacturers relying on the system \"to make a comeback and truly improve fuel economy and vehicles, because they won't be wasting billions of dollars from vehicles that people just overwhelmingly don't want. The rates of repurchases are decreasing significantly.\"\nAccording to McKinsey & Co.'s2024 Mobility Consumer Pulse,46% of EV owners in the U.S. said they were \"very\" likely to switch back to owning a gas-powered vehicle in their next purchase, due mainly to a lack of charging infrastructure and range limitations.\nSTUDY FOUND US GAS EXPORTS DID NOT IMPACT CLIMATE CHANGE, SO BIDEN ADMIN BURIED IT, OFFICIALS SAY\nThe Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said this month that it was beginning the process of rolling back automotive pollution and fuel economy standards set under former President Joe Biden, part of a broader initiative to peel back green energy initiatives. In January,President Donald Trump'sSecretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, also issued an order directing regulators to review the current Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards.\n(AP Photo\/Damian Dovarganes, File)\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDifferent solutions are being considered by states to supplement their lost gas tax revenues, including mile-based road usage charges, taxes on EV charging stations, and increased registration fees for EVs. A debate has also emerged over raising the federal gas tax\u2014which has not increased since 1993\u2014as a potential solution.\nIsaac said that in addition to amending federal fuel economy standards, he noted that raising the registration fee for EVs is a good solution. He said putting a tax on electric-vehicle charging stations would likely not generate enough funds to make up for the lost revenue.\nIsaac also posited that he was not very keen on the implementation of a vehicle-mile travel tax. He suggested that it could serve as a \"regressive\" tax on lower-income people who are struggling with the cost of housing, because they will have to move out of urban areas to rural or suburban areas, increasing the amount of miles they need to travel for work and other activities.\nIsaac is not a proponent of raising the federal gas tax either.\n\"We don't need to raise the tax, we just need to spend our dollars more efficiently,\" Isaac said. \"I thinkDOGE is going to helpwith that efficiency, so that dollars are truly making it to the maintenance of our nation's infrastructure.\"","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/clean-air-mandates-gas-tax-revenues-roads-bridges-infrastructure-expert","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":0,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

Trump\u2019s energy policies are fueling American independence","date":1742774400000,"body":"Energy Secretary Chris Wright discusses the Trump administration's energy agenda and declining gas prices on 'Special Report.'\nThe American people are starting to notice the change they voted for back in November. Despite all the hyperventilation and handwringing from the mainstream media in their leftist enclaves of New York and Washington D.C., things in the real world are actually starting to look good again. It\u2019s getting more affordable to get to work.Gas prices have dropped for the fourth straight week, and they are absolutely down from where they were under President Joe Biden.\nThe reason why isn\u2019t a mystery or a secret. We used to have a president who wasat war with American energy.Now, we once again have one who is unleashing it.\nFor four years,the Biden administration waged war on American energy \u2014 from canceling the Keystone XL pipeline to blocking drilling permits, restricting federal land leases and imposing crushing regulations on the oil and gas industry. The result? Gas prices soared, inflation spiked, and the average American family was forced to pay the price \u2014 literally. At the peak of Biden\u2019s energy crisis,gas reached over $5 a gallon. That was no accident.\nPRO-ENERGY GROUP URGES AG BONDI TO PROBE BIDEN'S AUTOPEN ON CRUCIAL DECISIONS THAT DEVASTATED INDUSTRY\nThat was a deliberate outcome of a policy designed to make traditional fuels unaffordable so that Americans would have no choice but to accept expensive electric vehicles (for which we still don\u2019t have the infrastructure) and unreliable alternative energy.\nGas prices are down significantly and that's because America no longer has a president who is at war with energy companies.(iStock)\nBiden\u2019s policies were never about helping working Americans. They were about forcing an extreme \"environmental\" agenda that made energy more expensive, all while claiming their reckless \"green\" policies would somehow save the planet. In other words, your family\u2019s budget was experimented on with the force of the federal government.Compare that to what\u2019s happening now after just a few weeks.\nIn just a matter of weeks, gas prices have been dropping. More than two-thirds of U.S. gas stations are selling gas for $2.99 per gallon or less. Thenational average is $3.02 per gallon,down 42 cents from last year. Meanwhile, let\u2019s not forget where things stood under Biden. At this point in Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, gas prices had already jumped up 49 cents.\nThat wasn\u2019t some global crisis; it was the result of bad policy.\nBy contrast, the momentPresident Donald Trump took office,he got to work fixing the problem. He declared aNational Energy Emergency, cut through the bureaucratic red tape strangling domestic production, and put an end to Biden\u2019s disastrous policies. Biden\u2019s energy agenda was never about saving the climate \u2014 if it were, his administration wouldn\u2019t have ignored the fact that China and India are the world\u2019s biggest polluters. It was about virtue signaling to the far left while working-class families paid the price.\nTrump understands what the radical left refuses to admit: Energy security is national security, and economic security is family security. That\u2019s why he has prioritized an all-of-the-above energy strategy that puts America first. Under his leadership, major energy producers are ramping up output, the U.S. is fast-tracking new energy infrastructure, and we areregaining our position as the world\u2019s top energy producer.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAnd there are more wins on the way. In February, Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council \u2014 a major step toward ensuring America\u2019s energy independence is never compromised again. Chaired by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Vice-Chaired by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the Council brings together key members of Trump\u2019s cabinet and top government agencies to oversee the resurgence of American energy dominance.This isn\u2019t just about reversing course \u2014 it\u2019s about securing America\u2019s energy future, fostering innovation and ensuring that our nation remains the world\u2019s leading energy powerhouse. With America\u2019s vast oil and gas resources and a constant flow of American innovation in the energy industry, America stands primed to lead the world into the next century of prosperity if we proceed wisely.\nBiden\u2019s policies were never about helping working Americans. They were about forcing an extreme \"environmental\" agenda that made energy more expensive, all while claiming their reckless \"green\" policies would somehow save the planet.\nThe Biden administration spent four years trying to convince Americans that high gas prices were just the new normal. They said it was \"Putin\u2019s price hike,\" a \"global supply issue,\" or anything else to avoid admitting the truth about their policies. The American people know when they\u2019re being played, everyone paying attention knew that gas prices didn\u2019t skyrocket by accident.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNow, with Trump back in charge, gas prices are falling, and the same people who claimed the government had no control over them arescrambling to explain why. They won\u2019t admit it, but the answer is simple: conservative, America-first energy policies work.\nThe recentprice drop under President Trump is what happens when America embraces energy independence instead of bowing to climate radicals and foreign competitors.

{"title":"Trump's outside-the-box 'gold card' proposal could be a remarkable game changer","date":1742601600000,"body":"Ohio GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno told Fox News Digital that the Chicago mayor is a 'bumbling idiot' and praised President Trump\u2019s immigration agenda\nMost people don\u2019t think about where the money comes from to build the things we use daily\u2014hospitals, hotels, train systems, and office buildings. However, in many cases, those projects exist because of the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, a little-known government initiative that helps create jobs and fund businesses without using taxpayer money.\nAt its core, EB-5 is simple: Foreign investors put money into U.S. businesses, and in return, they get a chance to apply for a green card. But to qualify, their investment must create at least 10 full-time American jobs. That means the EB-5 program doesn\u2019t just fund big projects\u2014it also provides real jobs for everyday people in industries like construction, healthcare, and hospitality.\nAnd now, with talk of apotential \"Gold Card,\"a program for ultra-wealthy investors, even more private money could flow into the U.S. economy, helping pay off national debt and fueling job growth. When speaking about the Gold Card, Trump said it \"will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship.\"\nTRUMP TOUTS $5 MILLION \u2018GOLD CARD\u2019 AS NEW PATH TO CITIZENSHIP\nA key advantage of the Gold Card would be that it would not impose global taxation, which is a significant deterrent for the wealthiest investors under EB-5. Many ultra-wealthy individuals send their children to the U.S. but avoid moving themselves due to tax concerns. By offering residency without taxing worldwide income, the Gold Card could unlock billions in foreign investment while allowing EB-5 to remain focused on job creation. These programs would diversify investment, strengthen infrastructure, and driveU.S. economic growth.\nHere\u2019s how EB-5 has already made a difference in communities across the country:\nThe biggest impact of EB-5 is job creation. Every investor must generate at least 10full-time jobsfor American workers. That means more construction workers, nurses, factory workers, engineers, and hotel staff getting hired.\nFor example, the Big River Steel Mill in Arkansas and the Philadelphia Convention Center expansion were both made possible with EB-5 funding\u2014creating thousands of jobs and keeping paychecks flowing for local workers.\nWhen you drive on a well-paved road, visit a new hospital, or take public transportation, there\u2019s a chance it was funded in part by EB-5.\nBrightline, Florida\u2019s high-speed rail system connecting Miami to Orlando, is a great example. Instead of relying completely on government funding, private EB-5 investors helped make the project a reality, reducing traffic congestion and boosting local businesses.\nEB-5 investments don\u2019t just benefit big cities\u2014they also bring businesses, jobs, and services to rural and struggling areas.\nTakeHarrison County Community Hospital in Missouri\u2014an EB-5-funded project that ensured local residents could access quality healthcare close to home. Without this program, many similar projects wouldn\u2019t have the funding to get off the ground.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nUnlike government stimulus programs that rely ontax dollars, EB-5 is a self-sustaining program. Since its creation, it has attracted over $55 billion in foreign investment, funding projects that directly benefit American communities, businesses, and workers.\nAnd the best part? This money doesn\u2019t come from taxpayers\u2014it comes from private investors who are required to create American jobs.\nAs a leader in the EB-5 industry for over 13 years, I have witnessed firsthand how this program transforms communities and strengthens the U.S. economy. Through my company,\u00a0EB5 Investors, I have worked with investors from all over the world, helping direct billions of dollars into job-creating projects across the U.S. This is more than just business\u2014it\u2019s about creating real opportunities for American workers at no cost to taxpayers.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Bottom Line: EB-5 Helps Everyday Americans\nWhether it\u2019s a paycheck, a hospital in your town, or a hotel where you work, the EB-5 program quietly improves the lives of everyday Americans.\nWith the potential for a new Gold Card program, increasing visa caps, and streamlining the EB-5 process, the U.S. could attract even more private investment, creating thousands of additional jobs and fueling economic growth\u2014all without costing taxpayers a cent. Like many other Trump plans, this appears to be a novel and out-of-the-box approach to our immigration system and ournational debt\u2014one that should not be overlooked.\nAli Jahangiri is the CEO of the largest platform connecting fund managers with international brokers who sell investment immigration programs, i EB-5 and other global residency and citizenship programs.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/trumps-outside-the-box-gold-card-proposal-could-remarkable-game-changer","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1,"topic_inflation":0,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

U.S. courts have strayed from commonsense assessments to the detriment of American innovation.\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House, March 7, 2025.(Reuters\/Evelyn Hockstein\/File Photo\/File Photo)\nWhen a company is sued for patent infringement, the potential damages should be limited to the specificvalue of the underlying technology. Unfortunately, this narrow focus has become more relaxed, and plaintiffs are now asserting damages calculations far greater than their intellectual property\u2019s value.\nWHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES\nConsider the advancedchips powering AI technologies. Each chip contains thousands of parts, many of which are covered by separate patents. If a plaintiff accuses a chipmaker of patent infringement, it should be able to claim\u00a0only damages limited to the value its patented invention adds to the chip\u2019s value. Instead, courts are increasingly awarding damages based\u00a0on\u00a0the entire chip\u2019s value.\nThe outcome is unreasonably large damages awards. In 2024, verdicts greater than $10 million, $50 million, and $100 million in patent cases\u00a0were up\u00a0over prior years. We are even seeing cases where damages reach into the\u00a0billions. Excessive damages are an unjust financial drain for high-tech manufacturers and an array of other innovative companies forced to pay more than they should owe.\nBloated damages are chum in the legal waters. Chum attracts sharks. In this case, non-practicing entities (NPEs) \u2013 which do not invent devices or techniques, or build and sell products \u2013 but collect patents to bring, and profit from, lawsuits claiming infringement.\u00a0More than half\u00a0of allpatent infringement lawsuitsin the U.S. are now initiated by NPEs, as the patent lawsuit business has attracted a surge of outside capital.\nThe possibility of winning eye-popping damages has caught the attention of litigation investors who fund legal actions in exchange for a share of any financial return. Litigation investment is a big business, totaling more than\u00a0$15 billion\u00a0in the U.S. today; and patent cases have been the largest category for new financial commitments in recent years.\nTHE LEFT THINKS TRUMP'S TARIFFS ARE A DECLARATION OF WAR. BUT THEY'RE CLUELESS ABOUT THE BATTLEFIELD\nNPEs pursuing large damages awards are ideal investment vehicles, particularly because in many jurisdictions the investor is allowed to remain anonymous. President\u00a0Trump\u2019s CIA Director John Ratcliffe referred to NPEs by their more familiar colloquial name \"patent trolls\" when he\u00a0explained\u00a0the trouble with this arrangement, namely that \"by funding patent trolls \u2013 shell companies whose sole purpose is to file patent infringement lawsuits \u2013 nefarious third parties, including foreign adversaries, can use intellectual property to attack U.S. companies through lawsuits.\"\nU.S. patent grants to global competitors are surging. In 2024, China-based companies saw a\u00a032%\u00a0increase in U.S. patents granted and foreign companies are making plays for superiority across a range of cutting-edge industries. Among them,a Chinese startup, DeepSeek, released an AI model that challenges the best that American companies have to offer.\nIt is crucial that we strengthen the rules governing our intellectual property system so that American innovators are not further hampered by those who attempt to game the system.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP IS MAKING MOVES TO BRING A GOLDEN AGE TO AMERICAN SMALL BUSINESSES\nThree reforms are necessary to address root causes of this abuse. First, federal courts should reassert their role as evidentiary gatekeepers, ensuring that unreliable expert testimony, which inflates damages, is not presented to the jury. We can\u2019t expect juries to make accurate decisions if they are fed bad information by supposed experts.\nSecond, Congress should pass Rep. Darrell Issa\u2019s\u00a0Litigation Transparency Act, a simple transparency measure mandating that litigation investors disclose their involvement in cases.\nAnd finally, the\u00a0Trump\u00a0administration must bolster the U.S. Patent Office\u2019s Patent Trial Appeal Board (PTAB) to give our innovators resources to deter and defend against abuse. The PTAB, and the administrative patent judges (APJs) who serve there, are tasked with invalidating bad patents, many of which are being used by NPEs to extort productive companies.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAPJs do their jobs much more efficiently than the federal courts and the PTAB is funded by fees, not by taxpayers. The president\u2019s newnominee to lead the Patent Office, John Squires, would be wise to ensure the PTAB can continue this important work.\nRight-sizing damages awards, increasing judicial transparency, and empowering the Patent Office\u2019s patent quality\u00a0review\u00a0will remove barriers to\u00a0economic\u00a0progress and prevent our competitors from undermining American industries.

Both the Trump administration and Congress are prioritizing an America First approach to the blockchain, ensuring we are the ones defining how these new digital assets are used, traded and created at home and abroad.\nOur opportunity now is to ensure that we shape this trend to serve American businesses and families. If the dollar is to be the currency of the digital age, then Washington must act to make that happen.\nThe good news is that durable, bipartisan progress is emerging. TheSenate Banking Committeejust advanced first-of-its-kind legislation for one key part of the blockchain ecosystem \u2013\u00a0stablecoins \u2013 in a landslide 18-6 vote.\u00a0 The House appears ready to follow with its version.\nThe strength of the U.S. dollar is not just a matter of national pride \u2013 it has tangible benefits for American businesses and families.(Igor Golovniov\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nThis congressional push reflects a shared national imperative for economic and technology competitiveness. Stablecoins are digital dollars that move securely, instantly and freely on blockchain networks. These are not cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that have significant price volatility. Stablecoins are fully reserved assets, meaning their value is always pegged one-for-one with the U.S. dollar.\nWHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES\nStablecoins are also a key tool inmodernizing the dollarfor the digital age by making all types of transactions cheaper, safer and more efficient. If regulated properly, they can cement the U.S. dollar as the most widely used currency for the fast-growing internet financial system \u2013 enshrining American economic strength for the next generation in the process. President Trump said as much at the Blockworks Digital Assets Summit, calling on Congress to pass \"common-sense\" legislation and affirming dollar-backed stablecoins will \"unleash an explosion of economic growth, and \u2026 expand the dominance of the U.S. dollar.\"\nThis shift in U.S. financial policy toward the blockchain may seem sudden, but it has been years in the making, dating back to when I served in the first Trump administration. And it reflects the structural trend of digitization that has already reshaped every sector aside from finance over the past few decades.\nAs White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks explained, \"Financial assets are destined to become digital like every other analog industry has become digital and we want that value creation to happen in the United States.\"\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently reinforced this shift by announcing that national banks can issue and process stablecoins, marking a major step toward integrating these digital dollars into the traditional banking system.\nTHE LEFT THINKS TRUMP'S TARIFFS ARE A DECLARATION OF WAR. BUT THEY'RE CLUELESS ABOUT THE BATTLEFIELD\nThis move legitimizes stablecoins as a core component of theU.S. financial infrastructureand provides regulated institutions with clarity to operate in this market. Importantly, stablecoins can serve this role only if they are subject to clear federal rules about reserves, transparency, one-for-one redeemability \u2013 key features that inspire trust.\nThankfully, the bills moving in both houses of Congress are promising.\u00a0Any good law would ensure that consumers are shielded from tokens masquerading as payment stablecoins that do not adhere to U.S. rule of law and oversight.\nStablecoin issuers should be required to publicly disclose their reserves and be open to independent audits to confirm those disclosures. And we should also ensure that American companies compete on a level playing field with offshore issuers and are incentivized to build and grow here in the U.S.\nThe strength of the U.S. dollar is not just a matter of national pride \u2013 it has tangible benefits for American businesses and families. A dominant and stable dollar means lower borrowing costs for businesses and homeowners, as global demand for dollar-denominated assets helps keep interest rates lower. It also translates into dramatically more efficient point-of-sale for merchants, reducing costs for retailers and consumers.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP IS MAKING MOVES TO BRING A GOLDEN AGE TO AMERICAN SMALL BUSINESSES\nA strong dollar helps curb inflation by making imports more affordable, ensuring that American households retain more of their purchasing power.

But as the EU is rushing to curb itsreliance on the U.S. for national security, the EU-China economic ties are only growing stronger.\nPROTECTING AMERICANS\u2019 DATA FROM CHINA IS CENTRAL TO AN AMERICA FIRST AGENDA\nChina is now the world\u2019s largest car-exporting country and that\u2019s in large part thanks to the popularity of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) in Europe. In fact, in 2023 the number of Chinese EVs exported to Europe outperformed American EV exports. Projections indicate that the market share of Chinese brands in Europe could rise from 2.5% in 2023 to nearly 10% by 2034, even despite tariffs imposed by the European Commission.\nSimilarly, the EU\u2019s goal to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 is fueling a deeper dependence on China. The EU remains heavily reliant on China for raw minerals to support solar and wind supply chains. The European Commission recently admitted that 75% of recent solar modules installed in Europe were imported from China.\nChina\u2019s technology ambitions are clear: surpass the U.S., infiltrate the industries of the future and threaten our national security in the process. Its curiously titled\u00a0\"Made in China 2025\" initiative aims to position the country as the global leader in advanced manufacturing, particularly in AI, robotics, aerospace and clean energy.\nCHINA THREATENS OUR FARMERS AND FOOD SUPPLY. STATES NEED TO STEP UP\nChina has already overtaken the U.S. in patent applications. The state massively invests in semiconductor production and green tech to reduce its reliance on American technology and control much of the world\u2019s supply chain for battery cells, solar modules and wind turbines. With billions pouring into research and development and state-backed firms to compete with U.S. giants like Google and Microsoft, China is directly challenging U.S. innovation and security.\nChina\u2019s state-backed aerospace manufacturer is now planning to expand further into Western markets with deeper investment into European jet maker Airbus and compete with America\u2019s dominant aerospace industry and its largest company, Boeing.\nSupporting American-made aerospace companies, which are prioritized to partner with the U.S. government as a builder and supplier of cutting-edge warfighting technologies, is critical for economic and national security.

{"title":"DOUG SCHOEN: I'm a lifelong Democrat. My party is failing and needs to learn from a winner","date":1742169600000,"body":"Sen. John Fetterman urged fellow Democrats on Tuesday to speak like normal people when pressed by MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle on the rise of \"oligarchs.\"\nRight now,it is clear that the Democratsare at a pivotal moment, and we need to choose an agenda that genuinely addresses Americans\u2019 concerns.\nIn the mid 1990\u2019s, whenformer President Bill Clintonran for re-election, he chose an agenda that spoke to the American people, not his party\u2019s most extreme wing.\nIt is critical that Democrats use a similar method today.\nFirst and foremost, there has to be recognition that, while the electorate does want fundamental change, it is not enough to say, \"we need to stand up to Trump and demonstrate against him.\"\nFormer President Bill Clinton listened to ordinary Americans, not the extreme wing of his own party. FILE: Clinton raises his hand to the crowd before giving his acceptance speech Thursday night at the1996 Democratic National Convention at the United Center.(Harry Hamburg\/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images)\nI understand the logic, but this simply does not work.\nOur party needs to stand for clear ideas and have an agenda reflecting a worldview that is distinctive, but not adversarial.\nIn other words, Democrats need to show themselves as a competent alternative to the GOP, but they cannot do so if their entire agenda is one of resistance.\nLet\u2019s be clear: the American people want a reduction in inflation, a secure border and a smaller, more efficient government that produces economic growth and can create jobs in other ways that increasing its own size.\nClinton noted as much in 1996 when he said the era of big government is over. This concept is increasingly alien to today\u2019s Democratic Party, which has yet to familiarize itself with the idea that the government can deliver for people without being excessively large.\nThat being said, the American people \u2013 and financial markets \u2013 are clearly uncomfortable with the extreme behaviors currently coming out of the administration.\nFor example, what Elon Musk and DOGE are doing agency by agency is well-intentioned, in theory, but the chaotic, wholesale cutting of entire agencies on a whim threatens to upend the economy.\nDemocrats need an alternative to DOGE, yet they\u2019ve failed to even have this conversation.\nDemocrats should consider their own version of DOGE. FILE: Elon Musk speaks during an event in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump at the White House on Feb. 11.(AP Images)\nBeyond that, we need to take steps to spur economic growth. As the Wall Street Journalhighlighted, an extremely positive Trump policy was letting companies deduct the full cost of capex in the year they\u2019re made.\nDemocrats should adopt that growth-supporting policy, and others such aspreserving state and local taxesdeduction (SALT) and extending tax cuts.\nFurther, Democrats must abandon their overly regulatory ideas that increase costs and delays in building housing and infrastructure. California Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom recently adopted this approach in rebuilding his state, but the rest of the party has failed to follow.\nThis goes far beyond basic economic principles. Rather, it is rapidly becoming a significant political vulnerability for Democrats, as New York Times columnist\u00a0Ezra Klein aptly described.\nWriting in the Times, Klein noted that Democratic strongholds have seen massive population decreases almost entirely because Democrats\u2019 anti-growth and overly regulatory agenda makes the cost of living in blue cities and states out of reach.\nNot only is this going to erode Democrats\u2019 political power by shifting congressional and Electoral College votes to traditionally red states, but also gives the lie to Democrats\u2019 claim to be the party of the working class.\nMoreover, Democrats need to begin promoting school choice and even supporting the role of charter schools. For one example, Success Academy has been a model institution, and this should not be overlooked, particularly as our public-school systems continue to receive failing grades.\nTo that end, progressives will blame the state of public education on the Trump administration\u2019s disdain for the Department of Education, but the facts are that the nation\u2019s worst schools tend to be in deep blue areas.\nDemocrats need an alternative to DOGE, yet they\u2019ve failed to even have this conversation.\nBeyond this, we need different types of schools, as it\u2019s no longer true that every job requires a four-year degree. Vocational and trade schools are just as important, and should be supported equally, if not more so.\nCritically, Democrats also need to come up with a commonsense approach to border security.\nThere is absolutely no reason that Democrats should be attacking the Trump administration for closing the border just months after an election where voters overwhelmingly rejected progressives\u2019 open border policy.\nTrue, a significant question remains as to how we can forge a bipartisan immigration deal that recognizes that Dreamers and those that have played by the rules deserve a pathway to citizenship. But there is no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater and refuse to work with the GOP on this.\nNew York Times columnist Ezra Klein wrote how Democrat-dominated cities and states are anti-growth and losing population. FILE: Klein during an interview on September 14, 2017.(Lloyd Bishop\/NBCU Photo Bank\/NBCUniversal via Getty Images)\nAlong the same lines, the Laken Riley act, which a number of Democrats voted for, is a clear example of what most people find logical and reasonable.\nThere should be absolutely no room or leniency for criminals who are here illegally. That is not inhumane, it is the most basic level of common sense.\nTaken together, Democrats must realize that they\u2019re failing to provide an alternative. They\u2019re so consumed with resistance that they\u2019ve been unable to muster, \"Yes, we are for smaller government, but key programs such as Medicare or Medicaid should be protected.\"\nFinally, there needs to be a sense of hope, aspiration and commitment to stability both at home and abroad.\nTariffs are fine to protect ourselves from China, but \u2013 as the markets have shown \u2013 they are less OK when those policies change every few days, as we\u2019ve seen with Mexico and Canada.\nPredictability and stability need to be the bedrock of our foreign policy.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nNo one opposes the idea of ending the war in Ukraine, or that the U.S. should recoup some benefits. It is also hard to not have been sympathetic to the American president given what happened in the Oval Office, when Trump met with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy.\nOf course, it gladdened me to see President Donald Trump restore American intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine, as America\u2019s role in defending that country from Russian aggression remains essential.\nThere should be absolutely no room or leniency for criminals who are here illegally. That is not inhumane, it is the most basic level of common sense.\nUltimately, the argument for Democrats is really one of stability, hope and a sincere commitment to the American people.\nIf the Democrats do that and can articulate these policies, there is a chance to retake the House in the midterms.

{"title":"The left thinks Trump's tariffs are a declaration of war. But they're clueless about the battlefield","date":1741910400000,"body":"'America's Newsroom' panelists Mark Tepper and Lydia Moynihan analyze how tariffs could impact Americans.\nWhen the U.S. declared war on Japan on December 8, 1941, no one dared see the U.S. as the aggressor because Japan had already bombedPearl Harbor. That\u2019s precisely how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff fight should be viewed: America isn\u2019t the aggressor but is simply defending herself.\nThe discussion about tariffs is not happening in a vacuum. The important context here is decades of other countries imposing stiff tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) on the U.S. while stealing our intellectual property, sending everything from violent criminals todeadly fentanylpouring across our borders.\nConsidering all these economic and non-economic factors, there are good reasons for President Trump taking such a tough stand on nations like Canada.\nTRUMP'S 25% TARIFF INCREASE ON ALL STEEL, ALUMINUM IMPORTS TAKES EFFECT, PROMPTING RETALIATION FROM EUROPE\nOur neighbor to the north imposes stiff tariffs and has insurmountable NTBs for many markets. Numerous American exporters have better access to Russian consumer markets than to Canadian ones!\nFor example,Canada imposes tariffs and NTBs, like quotas, that create an effective tax rate up to 270 percent on American dairy exports and other products, making them uncompetitive, at any price.\nPresident Trump is not the aggressor here. He\u2019s merely responding to long-standing economic attacks from a supposed friend.\nCanada also allows China to abuse country-of-origin provisions in the US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA), effectively giving China a backdoor into American consumer markets that circumvents tariffs on Chinese products.\nPresident Trump is not the aggressor here. He\u2019s merely responding to long-standing economic attacks from a supposed friend.\nLikewise, most of America\u2019s other trading partners do not treat her fairly.The European Union (EU), for instance, imposes a 10 percent tariff on U.S. automobiles while the U.S. has just a 2.5 percent tariff on European autos, and the EU\u2019s value-added taxes make the disparity even worse.\nIndia imposes tariffs of up to 150 percent on American exports like whiskey, compared to 2 percent charged on Indian spirits coming into America.\nJapan imposes a 25% tariffon American beef, while we impose just a 2% tariff on Japanese beef.\nAll these tariffs and NTBs penalize American industry, and the American worker, making it impossible for either to compete on the world stage by making U.S. exports more expensive and forcing U.S. companies to pay these tariffs to other nation\u2019s treasuries.\nWhile negotiating tariffs in his first term, President Trump told the EU he would eliminate all tariffs and NTBs if the EU did the same.

{"title":"A failing response to bird flu is hurting farmers and consumers","date":1741737600000,"body":"Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on how concerned people should be about bird flu spreading on 'Fox Report.'\nThe highly pathogenic avian influenza \u2013 commonly known as bird flu \u2013 is wreaking havoc onAmerican agriculture. This devastating virus, carried by birds worldwide, is currently spreading among U.S. poultry and dairy cattle, with several recent human cases reported among dairy and poultry workers.\nSince the outbreak began in 2022, more than 162 million birds have been culled. In the past 30 days alone,bird flu has been detectedin 24 states. The virus has been confirmed in poultry in all 50 states and, as of December 2024, dairy cattle infections have been reported in 16 states.\nThe situation is worsening. Herd, flock and human infections have risen, farmers are grappling with market uncertainty, and consumer prices continue to rise. The economic impact of this outbreak is staggering, threatening farmers\u2019 livelihoods across the country.\nThe economic impact of this outbreak is staggering, threatening farmers\u2019 livelihoods across the country.(iStock)\nIn the last quarter alone, more than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the United States have died due to bird flu, causing the conventional egg-laying flock to shrink by nearly 4% in January. The federal government has spent more than $1.25 billion compensating farmers for their losses. Yet, despite these efforts, the crisis remains unchecked.\nSMART POLICY AND CHEAPER EGGS: TRUMP-ROLLINS TEAM GOOD FOR FARMERS AND US CONSUMERS\nRather than responding with urgency and competence, the federal government\u2019s actions have been inadequate. In recent weeks, theDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE)has made sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, dismissing key personnel tasked with public health and disease control.\nWhile improving government efficiency is an important goal, the indiscriminate mass firing of federal workers, specifically those focused on protecting the health and safety of Americans, is not the solution. In fact, it is reckless and dangerous.\nReports indicate that among DOGE\u2019s first targets at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were Ph.D.-trained scientists who assist state and local officials in responding to disease outbreaks. Others dismissed from the CDC included fellows in the Laboratory Leadership Service, who develop tests for new and emerging diseases and often collaborate with the Epidemic Intelligence Service on outbreak responses.\nAt a time when public health efforts should be strengthened, the Trump administration\u2019s federal workforce cuts are undermining our ability to combat the bird flu crisis.\nNEW BIRD FLU STRAIN DETECTED IN NEVADA DAIRY WORKER, CDC SAYS\nThe damage extendsto the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), where microbiologists specializing in animal disease mitigation \u2013 including bird flu \u2013 were fired from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. On Feb. 18, USDA publicly acknowledged mistakenly terminating Food Safety and Inspection Service staff responsible for bird flu control and mitigation.\nUSDA stated that it is \"working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters.\" It is unacceptable for this administration to \"accidentally\" fire essential personnel tasked with containing this virus and safeguarding lives and livelihoods in rural America.\nThe consequences of this mismanagement are already hitting American consumers. Egg prices soared by 37% in 2024, far outpacing the overall food inflation rate of 2.5%. In January of this year alone, egg prices jumped more than 22%, reaching an all-time high of $7.09 per dozen. Projections suggest prices could reach nearly $10 per dozen by the end of the year.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nUnfortunately, USDASecretary Brooke Rollins\u2019 most recent comments have provided little reassurance, such as suggesting people should raise chickens in their own backyard. This is neither helpful, nor safe \u2013 it\u2019s absurd. So far, none of her proposed plans adequately address the squeeze farmers and consumers are facing right now.\nImporting additional eggs is not a reliable form of price stabilization, especially considering the 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico that continue to loom over the economy.. In 2023, the United States imported $44.1 million worth of eggs from Canada \u2013 more than 40% of all egg imports to the United States. Imposing tariffs on a reliable trading partner who makes up a significant portion of existing imports is not going to translate into better prices for consumers, and it certainly won\u2019t improve conditions for U.S. egg producers.\nFurther, $500 million to address biosecurity gaps is important, but farmers will still bear some of the cost while continuing to lose their hens and chickens. I\u2019m deeply concerned that this plan will impose further costs on farmers who are in an already dire situation, and many may not be able to enter this voluntary program due to the cost.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe federal response to this crisis has fallen short at the expense of our agricultural producers and American consumers. Instead of taking decisive action on Day 1 to curb the spread of bird flu or mitigating its cascading impact on our food supply chain, this administration\u2019s actions risk exacerbating the crisis.\nAs a member of Congress representing working-class families in rural America, I stand ready to work with the president, Secretary Rollins, and the rest of theTrump administrationto implement a comprehensive strategy to contain this virus, stabilize the farm economy, and lower food prices for working families across our country, and I hope the administration will be willing to rise to the challenge.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.

In response, U.S. corporations increased their domestic investment\u00a0by\u00a0an average of 20%, according to\u00a0an NBER study\u00a0that analyzed 12,000 corporate tax returns.\nTRUMP IS POPULAR AND SO ARE MANY OF HIS POLICIES. DEMOCRATS ARE TANKING\nThe lower tax rate is a major reason whyU.S. living standardshave far outpaced other developed countries over the last several years.\nA 15% tax rate would create a new wave of success. Shareholders, including the\u00a061% of Americans\u00a0who own stocks, and ordinary workers would be the biggest beneficiaries.\nA 15% corporate tax rate cut would also help small businesses,\u00a01.5 million\u00a0of which are structured as corporations. Small companies that service corporations and their workers would also benefit from new opportunities and higher revenues.\nI HELPED TRUMP GET HIS FIRST TAX CUT BILL THROUGH CONGRESS. FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION THIS TIME\nBut what about the vast majority of small businesses structured as pass-throughs and paying tax at individual rates?The\u00a0Republican\u00a0tax billshouldalso give these entities relief similar to that proposed for incorporated businesses.\nSmall unincorporated businesses were among the biggest beneficiaries of the TCJA. They received a 20% tax deduction, accelerated expensing, and lower tax rates, bringing new life to the nation's entrepreneurship climate.\nNearly\u00a020 million\u00a0small businesses benefit from the TCJA deduction every year. Unfortunately, the TCJA's small business provisions expire at the end of the year.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nLawmakers can keep the tax code fair\u00a0by\u00a0increasing the 20% small business tax deduction to 25%\u00a0at the same time they reduce thecorporate rate to 15%. This larger deduction means a small business earning $200,000 per year would face an effective tax rate that's roughly the same as corporations (not including other deductions).\nLawmakers should also look to extend this small business deduction to even more pass-through entities. Currently, it phases out at\u00a0about $200,000\u00a0of earnings for non-manufacturer single filers. Significantly increasing this income threshold would allow many more middle-class small businesses to enjoy tax relief, avoid punishments for growth, and compete\u00a0on\u00a0a level playing field with corporations.\nThesecorporate and small business tax cutswould spur an economic boom that would pay for much, if not most tax, of their cost in a replay of the original TCJA. Since 2017, inflation-adjusted\u00a0tax revenue\u00a0(excluding tariffs) has significantly increased.

Sadly, people from all different races and walks of life struggle to afford basic necessities like food and shelter. It\u2019s our responsibility to keep lifting these folks up \u2013 no matter their background, their family history or where they live.\nI have developed a plan \u2013 built around three legislative proposals of mine \u2013 to empower underserved communities like the one I grew up in.By boosting affordable housing,growing small businesses and bolstering my Opportunity Zones initiative, a tool for encouraging investment in distressed areas of the United States, we can positively impact the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans.\nHousing has long been a cornerstone of wealth-building in America. Yet today, too many families, especially in low-income and working-class communities struggle to access it.\nWhile the national average for homeownership is 65.7%, we need to close the homeownership gap between low- and high-income households. In 2023, just 47% of households in the lowest-income group were homeowners, compared to 81% in the highest-income group.\nThis gap directly results from outdated policies and a housing market that has become increasingly unaffordable to the very people who need it most.\nMy legislation, the \"ROAD to Housing Act,\" will tear down outdated barriers and unlock billions to make homeownership affordable again.\nAs the longest-serving Black senator in U.S. history and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I have seen firsthand that poverty does not discriminate.\nWe must expand access to small-dollar mortgages, redefine manufactured housing and modernize public housing. When families own their homes instead of renting them, they build generational wealth and close the wealth gap. We must ensure this opportunity is available to everyone.\nAnother tool for economic mobility is entrepreneurship.\nI know this firsthand.\nWhen I was starting my small business, I went to a bank and looked for an opportunity to get a loan. My best asset then was a 1990, 10-year-old car with 253,000 miles. One would not consider that an asset, perhaps a liability, but it was my only means of transportation.\nIn those days, people could get a character loan, and because of that loan, my financial life changed, and my American Dream became a reality.\nHad I not gotten that loan, I might not be where I am today.\nUnfortunately, others have not had the same blessing.\nExpanding capital access and reducing regulatory burdens on community banks, which are critical to supporting local and small businesses, will empower first-time and non-traditional entrepreneurs.\nThe forgotten men and women of America helped vote President Donald Trump into office. Many of them live in underserved communities that need government help.(Photo by Tierney L. Cross\/Getty Images)\nMy legislation, the \"Empowering Main Street in America Act,\" aims to enhance capital access for a wider spectrum of entrepreneurs, particularly those in underserved communities, including rural\/non-metropolitan areas.\nMy bill has strong support from my fellow Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee because it seeks to streamline regulations for small and newly public businesses that are looking to grow while also fostering new investment avenues for Americans eager to do business locally.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nI believe that when businesses flourish, entire communities prosper. Access to capital should not be reserved for the privileged few.\nFinancial inclusion means ensuring that people who pay their bills responsibly have this reflected on their credit scores, making it easier for them to obtain a loan or take out a mortgage. My legislative efforts have pushed for common-sense reforms because the process of determining a person\u2019s creditworthiness is outdated and not holistic.\nAs I think about Black History Month, I cannot help but think about how I have benefited from my family\u2019s sacrifices \u2013 and I know I am not the only one.\nWhen we find the right opportunities, better things will come.\nThrough my Opportunity Zones initiative, we have unlocked nearly $85 billion in investments for distressed communities.

While the energy industry welcomes the new business-friendly administration, the Biden administration\u2019s damage is not easily undone.\nKeystone was a privately funded projectconstructing 1,200 miles of pipeline that would have brought 850,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Alberta, Canada, to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refining.\nBecause it would cross international borders, the U.S. State Department has permitting jurisdiction. In 2015, the Obama State Department approved the project, but President Obama, urged by Secretary of State John Kerry, denied the permits in the name of climate change.\nA tanker truck trailer in a field along the Keystone XL pipeline route near Oyen, Alberta, Canada, on Jan. 27, 2021, alongside a picture of former President Joe Biden, who revoked\u00a0the permit for\u00a0the\u00a0pipeline.(Getty Images)\nTrump\u2019s reversal resumed construction, but the project was still ongoing whenJoe Bidenwas inaugurated, and on his first day he revoked the permission, putting more than a thousand people out of work.\nTHE GIGANTIC SLUSH FUND INSIDE THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE\nWith Keystone back in the news, here are three long-term consequences Biden\u2019s cancellation caused:\nBiden\u2019s cancellation set an ugly and dangerous precedent. The parent company of Keystone XL did not apply for a permit from the Obama State Department, nor did they make a deal with Donald Trump. They reached an agreement with the U.S. government, whose full faith and credit was undermined by Biden.\nObama fueled thedrama around Keystone XLby calling it \"dirty\" and invoking fear of climate change. This labeling could apply to any large-scale construction project: an airport, a nuclear plant, a refinery. Activist groups will always present their \"science,\" and outrage over \"climate justice\" can persuade a fickle future president to undo anything.\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama campaign in Philadelphia on Nov. 5, 2022.(Mark Makela\/Getty Images)\nThat is the precedent Biden set. America\u2019s word hinges on elections.\n5 PRIORITIES CRUCIAL TO SUCCESS OF TRUMP\u2019S ENERGY COUNCIL\nPart of President Trump\u2019s appeal is that he is not a career politician. He was a businessman and even more pertinent, he was a builder. The private sector understands financial risks in ways government never can.\nLook at the $2 billion grant Biden\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made toliberal activist Stacey Abramsfor a new climate nonprofit with zero staff and zero accomplishments. The organizations had only $100 in revenue, and yet it received a taxpayer investment 20 million times earnings. Such a windfall would never happen in the private sector.\nGovernment operatives, whether agency bureaucrats or longtime elected officials, don\u2019t understand the complexities of a project like Keystone. A lifelong politician himself, Biden\u2019s cancellation didn\u2019t come with a \"bailout\" by taxpayers.\nTHE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MUST INVEST IN INNOVATION TO REASSERT ENERGY DOMINANCE\nWould any company take another risk on a costly project with green crusaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., looming as wannabe White House hopefuls?\nThepersonal sacrifice energy workersmake for their jobs is often overlooked.\u00a0 On a 1,200-mile pipeline there are no Zoom meetings, working from home or even a commute home. You live at a camp, or many of the older workers have trailers or campers, and you travel with the project.\nLike all construction jobs with an end date, skilled workers are lining up their next projects in advance. There were workers on Keystone who had five years of projected employment, but after Biden\u2019s actions, lost everything at the hands of a guy who called himself \"Scranton Joe.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nUnlike today\u2019s maelstrom of coverage over the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) bringing accountability to government bureaucrats, there was no sympathy or support from the mainstream media.No fawning \"60 Minutes\" segmentor weepy CBS story of a park ranger who lost his \"dream job.\"\nThe Keystone XL workers were necessary casualties in Biden\u2019s effort to save the planet.\nEven with Trump in charge, government needs to win back the trust of industry. The federal government could sign an agreement that a cancellation of a project would lead to a refund of costs. Congress could reclaim permitting jurisdiction from the executive branch through well-written legislation.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAs a builder, Donald Trump understands the importance of infrastructure projects. The Alaska LNG pipeline will need more than a decade. Proposed LNG pipelines from Pennsylvania to New England will require at least five years.\nBusinesses are thinking twice before putting billions of dollars on the line. Workers are taking a second look before taking a flyer on a project that a politician could cancel.\u00a0These are not onlythe lessons of Keystone, but also the sad legacy of Joe Biden and the lasting damage he did to our country.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DANIEL TURNER\nDaniel Turner is the founder and executive director ofPower The Future, a national nonprofit organization that advocates for American energy jobs.

In poll after poll before and after the election, the economy and inflation consistently ranked as voters\u2019 top issue.\nPresident Donald Trump addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) annual meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, Feb. 22, 2025.(Reuters\/Brian Snyder)\nAfter one month, we\u2019re beginning to see the directionTrump is taking our economy, and it\u2019s not pretty. Groceries are more expensive than ever. The price of eggs is setting new records every day. Inflation is back over 3% for the first time in eight months. The nonpartisan experts at the Federal Reserve expect inflation to keep rising.\nTRUMPONOMICS WILL TAME INFLATION--NOT MAKE IT WORSE\nIt\u2019s no wonder that there\u2019s only been one president in modern history who has been less popular with the American people after one month in office than Donald Trump is right now: Trump again, back in 2017.\nTrump is claiming that this month\u2019s high inflation isn\u2019t his fault, trying to shift the blame back to the Biden administration. Trump wanted credit for the stock market\u2019s surge in November, three months before he was sworn into office, but since the economic news is less rosy now that he\u2019s in office, he\u2019s trying to shift the blame.\nIn Trump\u2019s world, the buck never stops with him. The American people disagree. In recent polls, almost two-thirds of voters say he isn\u2019t doing enough to address costs. Voters don\u2019t care about who\u2019s responsible. They want the problem solved, and they don\u2019t think Trump is getting it done.\nNo matter who you blame, it\u2019s a fact that Trump\u2019s policies will only push prices higher going forward. Right now, the biggest contributors to thoserecord-high egg pricesare fears about bird flu, which has infected poultry flocks in all 50 states and already killed at least one American. The administration\u2019s response? Firing U.S. Department of Agriculture employees working to contain the outbreak.\nNEW POLL SHOWS WHAT AMERICANS THINK OF TRUMP'S PERFORMANCE IN SECOND TERM\nThe administration has also defunded and shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, making it easier for big banks to take advantage of average Americans, raising their costs through hidden fines and fees.\nOver the coming months, Trump\u2019s policies will continue to push prices higher, none more than his aggressive tariff proposals. He has already imposed an additional 10% tariff on everything we import from China \u2013 one of our three largest trading partners. In less than two weeks, he has promised to implement additional25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada\u2013 our other two largest trading partners \u2013 followed soon after by 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and microchips.\nTariffs are simply a tax that gets passed down to consumers. If a retailer pays an additional 10% or 25% to import a refrigerator or a car, the company is simply going to increase the sticker price at the store. As more of Trump\u2019s tariffs go into effect, costs will rise on everything from the Canadian lumber we use to build our houses to Mexican tomatoes and lemons we buy at the supermarket.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\nThe tariffs will be Trump\u2019s most inflationary policy in the coming months, but many of his other hallmark policies aren\u2019t much better.\nWe do need to secure our border, but mass deportations will send the costs of food and housing skyrocketing once we\u2019ve removed half of our farmworkers and a fifth of our construction workers. Repealing the Inflation Reduction Act, as Trump has repeatedly said he wants to do, will eliminate the $35 per month cap on insulin prices for seniors and raise prescription drug prices across the board for millions of Americans.\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s policies that are supposed to curb rising costs are unlikely to be successful. He has claimed he\u2019s going to bring down the cost of energy by increasing oil production, but it will be hard to go much higher than the record levels of oil and gas production set during the Biden administration.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Trump administration\u2019s disastrousattempts to cut government spendingwon\u2019t help with inflation either: as DOGE fires food safety inspectors and air traffic controllers, the chaos in the marketplace will drive prices up.\nAll of this is bad news for Americans who just want cheaper groceries.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nIn 2024,candidate Donald Trump ran for presidentas someone who cared about the average worker in America. But during his first month in office, he has fallen head over heels for the billionaire class and forgotten the people who elected him. Right from the start, President Trump handed our government over to the richest man on the planet, Elon Musk, and gave him access to all our most sensitive, personal data so that Musk can use that exclusive access to make himself even richer.\nEven worse, Trump and Musk have launched a dizzying series of assaults on low- and middle-income workers, making clear that this billionaire takeover of our government will leave American workers even more powerless than they were before.\nAnd it\u2019s not just Musk \u2013Trump has surrounded himself with a band of billionaires who could not be more out of touch with the everyday experience of most Americans. The federal minimum wage has been the same since 2009: $7.25. Sixty-two percent of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15 because they agree if you work a full-time job, you shouldn\u2019t be living at or below the poverty level.\n'ONLY TAKES 3': DEMS PUSH PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION TO TURN GOP AGAINST ELON MUSK'S DOGE\nYou know who doesn\u2019t agree? Trump and his billionaire cabinet. His newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent \u2013 net worth $521 million \u2013 made it clear during his confirmation hearing that he believes workers don\u2019t deserve a raise in the embarrassingly low national wage floor.\nPresident Donald Trump ran a campaign to help American workers. Has he lived up to that? FILE: Trump speaks to the crowd at the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Thursday, July 18, 2024.(Paul Steinhauser\/Fox News Digital)\nIt only took one week for Trump to set his sights ondestroying labor unions,where many workers join together to bargain for higher wages and better working conditions. Trump\u2019s first target was the agency responsible for protecting workers\u2019 rights, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).\nThe NLRB conducts union elections, investigates allegations of unfair labor practices, and protects workers from being exploited by their employers, all of which enrages billionaires like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk. The NLRB can\u2019t operate with less than three of its five members. So, what did Trump do? He paralyzed it by firing NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox, who had another three years left in her term. With just two members left, the board has been rendered completely toothless and unable to order parties to pay remedies or recognize a union.\nBut it\u2019s certainly not surprising, with Musk in charge. Musk has always hated workers. He made that point very clear, outright declaring \"I disagree with the idea of unions,\" and he\u2019s successfully fought tooth and nail to block Tesla workers from ever forming one.\nTesla is the only major U.S. car manufacturer whose workers aren\u2019t represented by a union, and they are worse off because of it. Tesla employees make about 30% less than workers at GM and Ford, who are unionized through the UAW. And before Trump killed the NLRB, Musk\u2019s companies were the subject of 24 investigations for alleged labor violations. Now he has free rein to mistreat his workers.\nWe know what comes next because Trump has spent the first month in office executing a radical plan to hand government over to the billionaires. It\u2019s called Project 2025, and this anti-worker, pro-corporate plan previews what\u2019s ahead.\nProject 2025 outlined an end to all project labor agreement requirements, which protect good-paying union jobs, and a repeal of Davis-Bacon, which assures that construction jobs using taxpayer dollars pay a living wage to construction workers.\nEven worse, Project 2025 calls for limiting when workers receive overtime pay to only when they work more than 80 hours in two weeks. If you work 60 hours one week and 20 the next week, you won\u2019t get the overtime pay you earned in the first week.\nTrump and Musk have also spent their first weeks in office relentlessly demonizing federal workers. These are the people who inspect our food to make sure it\u2019s safe, provide medical care to veterans, administer Social Security payments and process passports. Four out of five federal workers live and work outside the D.C. area. Before he was confirmed, Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought said, \"We want to put [federal workers] in trauma.\"\nHouse Democrats were blocked from entering the Department of Education building in Washington, Feb. 7, 2025.(Fox News)\nThe greatest insult to workers will be the giant tax and spending bill that Trump and congressional Republicans are pushing through Congress. It cuts taxes for billionaires, millionaires and corporations, and to pay for those tax giveaways, Republicans are going to gut the programs that help minimum-wage workers and their families, like Medicaid.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nMedicaid pays for most nursing home beds in the country, where the parents of hard-working Americans spend their final days. Those nursing home beds will disappear, and working families will face bankruptcy, having to shoulder all the cost of expensive acute care for their loved one.\nAll of these attacks on workers happening at the same time, aren\u2019t a big coincidence. Trump has decided to empower the ruling class\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the billionaires, the big corporate CEOs, the financial firm titans\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and gut protections and services for everyone else.\nWe know what comes next because Trump has spent the first month in office executing a radical plan to hand government over to the billionaires. It\u2019s called Project 2025, and this anti-worker, pro-corporate plan previews what\u2019s ahead.\nMusk doesn\u2019t care about helping working people because his priority is using his newly purchased power to make money off his control of government. He used his role at the White House to get a meeting with India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi so he could talk about opening a Tesla factory in India and shipping jobs overseas.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHe shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so he can turn X into an unregulated payments app. He destroyed USAID to give China, where he manufactures half of his cars, more power on the world\u2019s stage. Unsurprisingly, Musk's personal net worth has increased $130 billion since the election.\nTrump might have run as someone who cared about regular people, but he\u2019s governing like someone obsessed with one, singular idea: steal from workers in order to enrich the very, very wealthy and the corporate class. Every day Americans see more proof of Trump\u2019s blind loyalty to members of his own billionaire clique and his abandonment of the working-class voters who supported him last November.

{"title":"America, let's make families great again","date":1740268800000,"body":"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nAs a pastor, I see firsthand every day the fundamental reality thatfamilies need strong communities,including Christian communities, and that communities, including Christian communities, need strong families.\nThis is one of the reasons I look at issues and proposals through the \"lens\" of the family. Does something help or harm families? Does it help strengthen families, bringing them closer together, rooting them deeper in their communities and helping them raise their children, or does it fragment families and make the tasks of raising children and being rooted in wider communities harder?\nI also ask, particularly in this time of falling birth rates, whether it helps men and women form families. Of course, there are many dimensions and factors at play, many issues on which we have to ask this question. One of these is government policy, and some might rightly point out there are more influential factorsthan what government does.That\u2019s true, and it would be a mistake to see government as the sole cause of or the only solution to all the challenges facing working families in America.\nPARENTS COULD SEE UP TO $12,000 CHILD TAX REFUND UNDER NEW BIPARTISAN HOUSE BILL\nBut, it would be equally a mistake to think that government policy doesn\u2019t matter or has very little effect on working families, including those I serve in my community. This new administration has a timely opportunity to help working families through the tax code. In particular, the administration has an opportunity to strengthen the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and make the process to claim it simpler, saving millions of working families valuable time and money.\nPresident Donald Trump aided families by doubling the Child Tax Credit during his first term. Inflation has chipped away at those gains.(iStock)\nThe CTC is a tax credit for working families with children. It\u2019s directly connected to work, so the more you work the better. Back in 2017,the credit was doubledby President Donald Trump to $2,000 per child, a majority of which is refundable based on the family's earned income. Yet, $2,000 today buys far less than it did in 2017, meaning the CTC has been greatly weakened by the sky-high costs of raising a family \u2014 an everyday challenge for so many of those I serve.\nIndeed, the American people know this; according to\u00a0a recent poll, 81% support adjusting the CTC every year to account for the rising cost of living, and 74% think it should be raised (from the current $2,000) to $5,000 per child. In addition, a full 78% support some form of \"baby bonus\" to help families with a newborn.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThis would be a pro-family and pro-family formation policy that could provide something like a $2,000 per-parent \"baby bonus\" that parents could receive direct to their bank account with the child\u2019s Social Security card, typically two to four weeks after their child is born. That makes it immediately helpful for post-birth expenses and to support parents in those wonderful (but sleep-deprived!) first few weeks after birth.\nOur communities, our nation, need strong families and working families need a strong CTC and other policies like the baby bonus to support them in those crucial early years. Indeed, Vice President JD Vance\u2019s call for a $5,000 CTC is a great place to start. We can also help working families by providing optional flexibility in how it\u2019s claimed and making sure it\u2019s linked to inflation, so it doesn\u2019t lose its value again.\nThe administration also has an opportunity to use tools and technology to help make sure all eligible working families are aware of the credit and easily able to claim it. This should be a part of a new and appropriate focus on customer service across government, including at the Internal Revenue Service. After all, government exists to serve citizens, not the other way around. Working families shouldn\u2019t need a tax professional or to spend hours and hundreds of dollars to claim these critical credits like the CTC and the Earned Income Tax Credit.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe administration is off to a good start, with Trump\u2019s nominee to head the Treasury Department, Scott Bessent,\u00a0testifying\u00a0that one of the current free filing programs at the IRS,\u00a0Direct File, will continue to be available this tax-filing season for working families to file their taxes. It is free to file and enables working families to see if they are eligible for the Child Tax Credit (as well as other credits) and,\u00a0if eligible, helps them claim the credits and file their Federal taxes.\nIt\u2019s been said a community\u2019s future passes through its families, so if we want strong neighborhoods, friendly communities, effective education and high-quality jobs, we need strong working families who are raising the next generation of neighbors, educators, employers and pastors!\nPastor Tony Lowden\u00a0is the lead pastor and founder of Jabez Ministries.

{"title":"We replaced families with Uncle Sam. DOGE must make the right choices when cutting","date":1740182400000,"body":"Fox News correspondent Mark Meredith joins 'Fox & Friends' to explain President Donald Trump ending taxpayer benefits for illegal immigrants and the president weighing sending DOGE savings checks to taxpayers.\nIf we want a smaller government, we need stronger families.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to shrink the size and scope of government through theDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE)has the potential to change the trajectory of the nation. But Trump can\u2019t deliver this promise only by cutting wasteful spending. American taxpayers have been forced to fund DEI programs in Europe, drag shows in Ecuador, and electric vehicle experiments in Asia \u2014 turning off this tap won\u2019t be enough.\nSoon, the path torestoring fiscal health in Americais going to lead the administration down much more politically treacherous paths \u2013 ones that may include trimming government programs that millions of Americans use.\nIf this causes us to panic, we ought to ask the obvious question:\u00a0why\u00a0are so many millions of Americans reliant on programs like housing assistance, food stamps and government-funded healthcare? In fact, a big part of the answer is that the decline of marriage and thecollapse of familieshas fueled much of our nation\u2019s large-scale dependence on government to meet too many of our basic needs.\nOur nation has outsourced the key functions of family to the state and that isn't working.(iStock)\nIn order for DOGE to navigate these waters and accomplish its massive ambition, it will have to think along deeper lines than trimming staff and wasteful programs from the federal government. It will have to relinquish government power back to smaller units: families, communities and states.\nThe Center for Christian Virtue and the Institute for Family Studies recently collaborated on a new study called\u00a0\"The Hope and a Future Report.\"\u00a0This report takes a deep dive into how decreasing marriage rates, especially among the low-income Ohioans, are driving poverty, academic failure and violence in our communities \u2013 all of which drive the growth of government.\nConsider child poverty: In Youngstown Ohio, 68% of children are living in homes without a married father. Fifty percent of Youngstown children are in poverty.\nFrom there, the data tracks on nearly a straight line down: in Vice President JD Vance\u2019s hometown of Middletown, Ohio, 51% of children are living in unmarried homes, with 26% of kids in poverty.\nThen you have New Albany, Ohio, where 91% of children are being raised in a married home, and a mere 4% child poverty rate. More broadly, what we see is that children in single-mother families are four times more likely to be poor in Ohio than children in married families.\nFor DOGE, and any leader interested in scaling back the size of government at the federal or state level, child poverty is their scourge. Children in poverty are far more likely to rely on government services not just today, but long into the future.\nAgain, look to Ohio for a case study. In Republican Gov. Mike DeWine\u2019s projected 2025 budget, the state Office of Budget and Management says Ohio is expecting to receive $25.5 billion dollars from the federal government \u2013 the majority of this for Medicaid, a program specifically for low-income children, families and adults.\nIn fact, family breakdown is deeply tied to the three biggest items in state spending. Typical state budgets do three things: education, health and human services and law and order. They educate, they medicate and they incarcerate.\nOne of the big thing governments spend money on is incarceration. FILE: Kern Valley State Prison in California(Luis Sinco\/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\nA staggering 88.4% of Ohio\u2019s budget is spent on these three areas and all three are more expensive for taxpayers when kids aren\u2019t born into the ideal and most stable environment. That\u2019s because school failure, child poverty and antisocial behavior are significantly more common for children and families in non-intact families.\nChildren from non-intact families in Ohio are 72% more likely to have their parents contacted by a teacher or principal at their school for behavioral or learning problems, compared to children from intact, married families, according to an IFS-CCV analysis of the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIncluded in the\u00a0Hope and a Future Report\u00a0is a first-ever\u00a0Family Structure Index\u00a0which ranks all 50 states according to the health of their family culture. The Index analyzes demographic and fertility data to investigate which states are home to the strongest, most stable and most sustainable families.\nUnsurprisingly, we see a connection between healthy and stable families and the economic well-being of a state. Seven of the top 10 states in the\u00a0Family Structure Index\u00a0are also in the top 10 in the\u00a0American Legislative Exchange Commissions Laffer State Economic Outlook Rankings of 2024, which analyzes the states with the lowest tax and regulatory policies. In other words, one reason states like Utah, Idaho and South Dakota are doing so well economically and fiscally is that they also have some of the strongest families in the nation.\nFor DOGE, and any leader interested in scaling back the size of government at the federal or state level, child poverty is their scourge. Children in poverty are far more likely to rely on government services not just today, but long into the future.\nElon Musk, who is currently overseeing Trump\u2019s DOGE, has been a great advocate for half of the family solution here: that we should celebrate children. But, judging by his own approach to family formation, he doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate how much marriage matters for our kids and our country.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn order to protect these children from poverty and to keep them from ultimately becoming dependent on the government, we first need to encourage marriage. This not only best serves the kids, but over the coming years will make federal and state government far more efficient than even Musk\u2019s wildest dreams.\nBrad Wilcox is Distinguished University Professor at the University of Virginia, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and the author of \"Get Married: Why Americans Must Defy the Elites, Forge Strong Families, and Save Civilization.\"\nAaron Baer is the president of the Center for Christian Virtue.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM BRAD WILCOX\nBrad Wilcox (@BradWilcoxIFS), a sociology professor and director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, is a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the author of\"Get Married: Why Americans Must Defy the Elites, Forge Strong Families, and Save.\"","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/we-replaced-families-uncle-sam-doge-must-make-right-choices-when-cutting","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

Its work is likely to contribute to unprecedented economic development opportunities for Americans while providing our diplomats and peacemakers with important assets to help solve geopolitical challenges that make the world safer.\nOn Jan. 20, President\u00a0Trump\u00a0started his second term at the dawn of a once-in-a-century electrification supercycle.The International\u00a0Energy\u00a0Agency recently said the world will need to build as much capacity in the next five years as the U.S. and Europe did in the last 136 years.\nPresident Donald Trump and Energy Secretary Chris Wright(Getty Images\/Reuters)\nWhile much of the focus is properly centered on addressing the imperative of leadership for artificial intelligence and data centers, the demand drivers are much broader.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S PRO-ENERGY AGENDA WILL UNLEASH AMERICAN JOBS AND ENERGY SECURITY\nSimply stated, America and the worldneed a lot more electricity. Who provides it will determine prosperity at home and abroad. And, importantly, who builds and innovates the technology for electricity will win the space race of our generation.\nAs the CEO of America\u2019s leading electricity manufacturer, with 18,000 U.S. employees at 18 U.S. factories building gas turbines, nuclear power plants, critical grid equipment and software, and renewable equipment, I believe the\u00a0Energy\u00a0Council\u00a0can win for the U.S. and globally. To do so, my strongest advice is for the\u00a0Council\u00a0to put U.S. manufacturing at its core and consider these five priorities:\nExpand U.S. baseload\u00a0energy:Immediate progress\u00a0can\u00a0be made by simply improving what we already have. For example, in North America technology upgrades\u00a0can\u00a0be added to just one class of our industrial gas turbines that will add 14 gigawatts to our system. Upgrading nuclear and restarting decommissioned sites\u00a0can\u00a0add 2GW. And my company is ready to upgrade 35,000 onshore wind turbines so they\u00a0can\u00a0produce more\u00a0energy\u00a0from where they stand today.\nThe\u00a0Energy\u00a0Council\u00a0can\u00a0then go beyond the existing base to accelerate new baseload by deploying state-of-the-art gas andnuclear technologymanufactured in U.S. factories with sound policy, permit streamlining and partnership with the private sector.\nTHE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MUST INVEST IN INNOVATION TO REASSERT ENERGY DOMINANCE\nGrow the grid:President\u00a0Trump\u2019s executive orders and his Cabinet have put more emphasis on the need to build the grid than we\u2019ve ever seen. They are right to do so. Our grid is the unsung hero of our\u00a0energy\u00a0system and the \"central nervous system\" of our\u00a0energy\u00a0infrastructure.\nBut even heroes have vulnerabilities \u2013 and our grid needs immediate help. The\u00a0Council\u00a0can\u00a0secure our\u00a0energy\u00a0backbone by partnering with the private sector to modernize and build strategic reserves of critical grid equipment, growing factories and jobs along the way, and approaching the hardening of the grid with a security mindset.\nTreat\u00a0energy\u00a0through a competitive lens:To truly achieve the president\u2019s goals for \"the next century,\"\u00a0energy\u00a0innovation and competitiveness are key. Beyond our baseload needs, we are also building the world\u2019s leading \"all of the above\" technologies in the United States, critical not only for getting as many affordable electrons on the grid as possible, but to maintain U.S. leadership in all\u00a0energy\u00a0technologies.\nThe focus of the\u00a0council\u00a0should go beyond what we\u00a0can\u00a0do today and includefuture breakthrough technologiessuch as small modular reactors and carbon capture systems. If we don\u2019t lead the innovation in the U.S., others will, and the\u00a0Energy\u00a0Council\u00a0is well positioned to enable U.S. leadership in the near term while innovating for the future.\nTRUMP ENERGY PLAN WILL AVOID EUROPE\u2019S ENERGY DISASTER\nBuild it in the U.S.President\u00a0Trump\u00a0is right to talk about unleashing U.S.\u00a0energy. But it\u2019s not just the electrons and molecules that matter. The true foundation to\u00a0energy\u00a0dominance\u00a0is U.S. manufacturing and industrial capacity. We need to build on that legacy.\nAfter all, the first electrification revolution started with Thomas Edison innovating in upstate New York. Today, the technology we build in places like Greenville, South Carolina, Pensacola, Florida, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is among the most sophisticated equipment made anywhere.\nThe\u00a0Energy\u00a0Council\u00a0can\u00a0unlock the next U.S. manufacturing renaissance with the right policies, including manufacturing and\u00a0energy\u00a0production tax credits, ensuring prosperity for American workers and competitive strength globally for America.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nSolve geopolitical challenges:President\u00a0Trump\u00a0has uniquely spoken about the opportunity for U.S.\u00a0energy\u00a0assets to solve conflicts and bring prosperity to the world. As a company whose equipment helps provide 25% of the world\u2019s electricity in more than 100 countries, we see the opportunity every day for\u00a0energy\u00a0to be at the foundation of peace and prosperity. I recommend the\u00a0council\u00a0consider both\u00a0energy\u00a0and the equipment that generates electricity alongside each other as they advance this important mission.\nPresident\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0Energy\u00a0Councilis the right opportunity in the right place at the right time to help ensure American leadership and geopolitical prosperity at the beginning of an electrification supercycle that\u00a0can\u00a0reshape economies.

Chuck Schumer's, D-N.Y., opposition to the budget resolution.\nFIRST ON FOX:A new initiative is tracking government agency spending in comparison to growth, and a conservative fiscal watchdog group has discovered what it deems to be an alarming trend.\nAccording to OpenTheBooks, staff levels at theDepartment of Educationhave decreased since 2000, but the agency's spending grew by 749%. OpenTheBooks says the calculation is \"even more galling\" after recent statistics from the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that student achievement has still not recovered since it saw big drops during theCOVID-19 pandemic.\nThese graphs allegedly show numbers from the Department of Education that were uncovered by OpenTheBooks. The department's staff has gone down since 2000, but the agency's spending has increased nearly eightfold.\nOpenTheBooks' data on theDepartment of Educationis part of a wider initiative being unveiled by the group on Thursday to chart agency outlays versus agency spending in an effort to provide the public with \"a clearer picture of the government as it stands.\" As OpenTheBooks tracked agency spending versus size, it found that federal agency spending has far outpaced the rate at which these agencies have grown over time.\nIna reportannouncing the new initiative, the fiscal watchdog group cited complaints about purported cost-saving efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its leader, tech billionaire Elon Musk, questioning the need for spending cuts in the face of a federal workforce that has largely remained static in terms of size.\nIn some cases, such as with the Department of Education, the group found as much as a sevenfold increase in spending while staff headcounts remained relatively static or even went down.

For example, Department of Education staffing levels have decreased over the last 25 years as spending grew nearly 750%.\nIn addition to tracking outlays versus agency growth, OpenTheBooks also found that at least 75 federal agencies listed in the Federal Register are effectively \"defunct or obsolete,\" as they have become subsumed by other entities, renamed or in some cases no longer even exist. The group noted that records of these \"defunct\" agencies are frequently out of date, making it hard for the public to ascertain a complete picture of the federal government.\n\"In manyfederal agencies,spending has outpaced not just inflation but also growing headcounts \u2014 often many times over. This begs an important question: Where is the money going?\" OpenTheBooks CEO John Hart said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Taxpayers deserve to see the growth in spending in each agency so they can decide how many we need \u2026 If the excessive waste and fraud we've uncovered over the years \u2014 and DOGE is highlighting \u2014 is any guide, taxpayers may be better served by far fewer than 441 agencies, including the ones that are defunct.\"\n\u2018WASTEFUL AND DANGEROUS\u2019: DOGE'S TOP FIVE MOST SHOCKING REVELATIONS\nThe Department of Government Efficiency found a code linking treasury payments to a budget line item that was not previously required.

In recent weeks, Google, Amazon, Walmart, Ford, McDonald\u2019s and many other major corporations, facing backlash and declining employee morale, have backtracked from DEI, shifting gears in the face of mounting legal and financial risks.But Costco, against the tide,has doubled down on its DEI initiatives \u2014 at the peril of its bottom line, and now, its legal standing.\nCostco\u2019s DEI programisn\u2019t just a set of lofty ideals. It is embedded in the company\u2019s operations at every level, with a\u00a0Chief Diversity Officer\u00a0at the helm and employees dedicated solely to\u00a0diversity\u00a0goals. This program informs hiring decisions, with race and gender as key factors in determining who is hired.\nMoreover, the company favors racial minorities and women-owned businesses when selecting\u00a0suppliers, and its\u00a0donations\u00a0go to controversial activist groups \u2014 some of which have been accused of illegal\u00a0racial discrimination\u00a0themselves.\nFORMER COSTCO EXECUTIVE DEFENDS ITS DEI POLICIES, SAYS CRITICS DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY'S CULTURE\nIn a bid to halt Costco\u2019s DEI trajectory, a shareholder\u00a0proposal\u00a0was recently brought forward, urging the company to evaluate the risks associated with its diversity policies. This proposal pointed to the legal case of Starbucks, which was forced to pay a $25 million verdict for a single instance of discrimination against a White employee. While that case involved only one individual, thefinancial fallout for Costcocould be catastrophic.\nWhile many companies move away from DEI, Costco continues to stick to its outmoded strategy. FILE: In an aerial view, the Costco logo is displayed on the exterior of a Costco store on July 11, 2024, in Richmond, California.(Photo by Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images)\nIf even a small fraction of Costco\u2019s up to 200,000 non-minority employees decided to sue, the company could face judgments running into tens of billions of dollars. But when confronted with this data, Costco didn\u2019t retreat; instead, the company\u2019s board rejected the proposal and defended its DEI program. The company claimed that its focus on diversity wasn\u2019t just about improving financial outcomes, but about \"enhancing our culture and the well-being of people whose lives we influence.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nDespite the risks outlined, the three biggest asset managers \u2014 BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street \u2014 were complicit with the board in driving Costco\u2019s DEI push. With significant\u00a0stakes\u00a0in the company, these investment giants control nearly a fifth of Costco\u2019s shares. Their votes likely provided the critical mass necessary for the proposal\u2019s overwhelming passage. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have continued to champion DEI, even as its legal implications grow clearer.\nCostco\u2019s blind commitment to DEI is now drawing the attention of legal authorities at the highest levels. In late January, President Donald Trump issued an\u00a0executive\u00a0order directing federal agencies to scrutinize companies that maintain illegal discriminatory practices, including DEI initiatives. Each agency is tasked with identifying companies \u2014 such as Costco \u2014 that may be violating federal laws prohibiting discrimination.\nOn top of this, a coalition of 19 state attorneys general has stepped up, urging Costco to reevaluate its DEI policies. They\u00a0argue\u00a0that Costco\u2019s programs may be in violation of anti-discrimination laws, and the company has just 30 days to comply with their demands or face further legal action.\nCostco\u2019s decision to dig in its heels on DEI is a bold one and could prove to be disastrous. The mounting legal challenges and the ever-growing body of evidence showing that DEI programs increase workplace\u00a0hostility\u00a0and fail to yield the promised business\u00a0benefits\u00a0should give pause to anyone still holding out hope for their success.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAs more states and federal agencies take a closer look at the legal ramifications of DEI policies, companies like Costco may soon find themselves on the wrong side of the law, facing penalties that far outweigh any short-term cultural benefits. For investors, this should be a wake-up call. Costco\u2019s stock has tripled over the past five years and is sitting at an all-time high. Pushing for divisive, race-based policies could alienate customers and increase legal exposure, impacting the share price.\nThe tide is turning for most firms. Companies across America are waking up to the dangers of DEI. Disney, Target and Anheuser-Busch all saw their stocks plummet after DEI controversies and are trying to make amends. Costco might be next to learn that diversity at the expense of the law and customer preference is a bet that doesn\u2019t pay off.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANSON FRERICKS\nAnson Frericks is the co-founder of Strive Asset Management and the author of,\"Last Call for Bud Light.\"","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/costco-investors-could-pay-big-time-its-dei-policies","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":0,"topic_taxes":0,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":0,"topic_energy":0,"topic_crypto":0}

{"title":"The impending AI-driven jobless economy: Who will pay taxes?","date":1739404800000,"body":"Vice President JD Vance addressed the AI Action Summit in Paris Tuesday during his first foreign trip since taking office. (AP)\nOur socioeconomic system is facing anexistential threat from AI. In our capitalist society, most people depend on jobs to sustain themselves. The U.S. government, in turn, relies heavily on taxing the income of individual workers for revenue.\nAsartificial intelligence progressively eliminatesjob opportunities, a growing number of individuals will face severe job insecurity, leading to a corresponding decline in federal revenue. Radical action is needed now to steer away from a dystopian collapse toward better possibilities.\nSpecifically, income-based taxes must be replaced with some other form of taxation, and the support mechanisms for the unemployed must be adapted to support a large population that will have been pushed out of the job market. Given that the use of AI in place of human workers is the cause of the problem, it makes sense that the commercial use of AI systems should be taxed to compensate Americans for lost wages and the federal government for the loss of income-based taxes.\nThe revenue collected by the U.S. government is currently based on taxing working humans.\nThe motivation for these concerns is thatAI capabilities are advancing rapidly, and while most jobs are currently safe, it is becoming clear that AI will eventually perform nearly any task more efficiently and cheaply than people can. From manufacturing to customer service and even creative fields like writing or music, machines are already showing that they can outperform humans.\nAI CAN\u2019T WAIT: WHY WE NEED SPEED TO WIN\nThe wide range of robots under development will extend AI's reach to include physical jobs, such as construction, healthcare and house cleaning. Although this transition won\u2019t occur overnight, it is inevitable. Companies will continue replacing human workers with AI-driven systems because it saves money and boosts productivity. The question isn\u2019t if AI will take over most jobs, it\u2019s when.\nA future where robots do all the work could be great if we plan now for the societal implications of widespread unemployment. The obvious problem is that without jobs, people will have no way to pay for food, housing or anything else. The slightly less obvious problem is that the revenue collected by the U.S. government is currently based on taxing working humans.\nAdding up payroll, income,Social Security and Medicare taxestogether accounts for more than 80% of federal revenue. As unemployment grows, the tax base will diminish, resulting in a substantial decline in government revenue. Our economy will face a double whammy of falling revenue while at the same time growing numbers of people who genuinely and through no fault of their own need support.\nAI IS RESHAPING BUSINESS. THIS IS HOW WE STAY AHEAD OF CHINA\nTraditionally, the issue of supporting non-workers, for example, through Welfare or Universal Basic Income (UBI), has been objectionable to many because it fundamentally involves taxing the production of workers to support those who don\u2019t work. That type of wealth reallocation evokes alienating comparisons to socialism or communism. Even if we were willing to accept the idea of taxing workers and using the money to support others, that requires a large pool of workers to tax, which we won't have because AI will have taken their jobs.\nHowever, withAI replacing human workers, we have an alternative method for funding support mechanisms like UBI. What we need to do is figure out a reasonable way to tax the work done by AI and distribute the proceeds rationally to human beings.\nThis proposal is very different from socialism or communism in that we aren't taking the fruits of one person's work and giving them to someone else. Instead, we would be taking the proceeds of AI\/robot effort and sharing them out to humans.\nHOW TEAM TRUMP CAN MAKE AI STAND FOR AMERICAN INNOVATION\nGiven that AI systems have been trained on vast amounts of the public's data, there is even a compelling economic justification for taxing these AI systems and sending money back to the public. Think of it as a license fee paid to American citizens for using their data.\nOf course, many Americans also object to taxing businesses. FromAmazon to mom-and-pop groceries, the concern is that taxes would be burdensome and harmful to the business.\nHowever, these companies will see huge savings from replacing workers that might cost $30K to $300K per year in salary with robots that could easily cost less than $30K and have annual maintenance and power costs well under $20K per year. The savings for non-physical jobs will be even larger as those won't require a physical robot, just an AI running in the cloud.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAs an added bonus, these AI workers operate 24\/7 without needing rest. (Note that the power bill wouldnotbe prohibitively expensive. Training a large AI can be costly, but once trained it can be replicated many times with each copy able to run on a high-end personal computer using less than $10 of electricity per day.)\nWhen anAI-driven robot makes something, a sandwich or a car, it creates new value: the difference between the raw materials and the final product. Similar value is also created if the robot mines gold or harvests lumber. If a human did the work, then that value would be split three ways: employer, human employee, government. However, when a robot does the work, there is no human employee in the split.\nIn essence, I'm suggesting that we find a way to put humans back into that equation. The way that seems most obvious to me is that the AI work should be taxed and the proceeds used to support American citizens through UBI, or something similar.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAdmittedly, it's unclear how we should actually measure \"AI work\" in a reasonable way, but even if that were a fatal flaw in this proposal, the motivating problem ofAI taking over most jobsis still looming ahead. Whether it's taxing AI work or something else, we need to come up with some plan and start implementing it now.\nWe could have a bright future where people could live their lives comfortably, focused on their own passions instead of working for others.

I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\"\nMUSK'S NEXT TARGET? TRUMP SAYS DOGE WILL LOOK AT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, PENTAGON FUNDING\nPresident Trump is requesting the Treasury Department to stop manufacturing pennies, due to high costs.(Olivia Oxley via AP)\nIn fact, producing pennies is even more expensive than Trump\u2019s numbers. According to a 2024 U.S. Mint report, it costs nearly 3.69 cents to mint a single penny. The coins are primarily made of zinc and then covered in copper.\nTrump\u2019s statement comes after Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who is heading up the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), posted on X in January how expensive minting pennies is.\nDOGE is tasked with identifying ways to eliminate waste, and has so prompted changes, including gutting the $40 billion U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which provides aid to impoverished countries and development assistance.\nStill, proponents of the penny exist. Americans for Common Cents, an organization that provides Congress and the White House with research on the value of the penny, claimed that efforts are better targeted at reducing the cost of the production for the nickel.\nNickels, worth five cents, cost approximately 13.8 cents to mint, according to the 2024 U.S. Mint report.\n\"The logical and fiscally responsible solution is not to eliminate the penny but to focus on producing a cheaper nickel,\" Americans for Common Cents Executive Director Mark Weller said in a Jan. 23 statement. \"This approach would address the real driver of losses while preserving the functionality of small denominations in everyday transactions.\"\nWhile the waters are a little murky on the next steps, experts say Congress likely would need to become involved and pass legislation to fulfill Trump\u2019s wishes. And, historically, previous attempts in Congress to eliminate the coin have failed.\nUSAID STAFFERS STUNNED, ANGERED BY TRUMP ADMIN'S DOGE SHUTDOWN OF $40B AGENCY\nNickels cost approximately 13.8 cents to mint, according to the 2024 U.S. Mint report.(Kevin Lamarque\/Reuters)\n\"The process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,\" Robert Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University,told the Northeastern Global News.\nEven so, there is bipartisan interest on Capitol Hill to modify minting pennies. In 2023, Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Maggie Hasson, D-N.H., reintroduced legislation to alter the composition of the penny to cut down on costs.\n\"It\u2019s absolute non-cents that American taxpayers spend ten cents to make just one nickel. Only Washington could lose money making money,\" Ernst said in a statement in April 2023. \"This commonsense, bipartisan effort will modify the composition of certain coins to reduce costs while allowing for a seamless transition into circulation.

{"title":"'Constitutional crisis': The Impoundment Control Act takes center stage after Russell Vought's confirmation","date":1739145600000,"body":"Fox News host Laura Ingraham reports that President-elect Donald Trump nominated Russ Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget again.\nA power struggle concerning government spending is heating up inWashington, D.C., igniting what some Senate Democrats call a \"constitutional crisis\" amid the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to curb government waste.\nThe conflict stems from PresidentDonald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Russell Vought, and was exacerbated when the Trump administration announced it wouldfreeze federal grants and loanson Jan. 27 in an OMB memo.\nBoth Trump and Vought share a common point of contention: the Impoundment Control Act.\nThe 1974 law, which Trump and Vought both argue is unconstitutional,reasserts Congress' power of the purse and bars the executive branch from unilaterally side-stepping Congress and withholding appropriated funds.\nHowever, many legal experts warn that the matter is not up for debate, and the courts are clear; it is unconstitutional for the executive branch to divert dollars Congress has authorized.\nThe Senate voted to confirm Vought on Thursday by a 53\u201347 margin along party lines, following a 30-hour delay from Democrats in protest against his nomination.\nRepublicans claim that Vought is qualified to lead the department because he previously served in that role during Trump\u2019s first term. Sen. Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Wednesday that Vought would \"be able to hit the ground running.\"\nHowever, Democrats remained staunchly opposed to Vought's nomination and claimed his views on impoundment disqualified him from the role, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., arguing on Wednesday that Trump and Vought believe \"they may be above the law.\"\nHowever, what is the Impoundment Control Act? Here is a look at what's up for debate regarding government spending \u2014 and what changes could emerge during the Trump administration.\nArticle I of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the authority to manage the federal budget to determine funding decisions to balance power between the branches of government.\nHowever, the act of impoundment occurs when the executive branch chooses to not spend these approved dollars from Congress, since the executive branch and the Office of Budget and Management do oversee the actual spending of the approved funds.\nShould a president want to spend less than what Congress has budgeted, the executive branch must secure approval from Congress. Deferring funds also requires the executive branch to inform Congress.\nAs a result, Congress passed the 1974 Impoundment Control Act to establish these proper channels of congressional oversight if a president chooses to withhold or defer these funds.\n\u2018ULTRA-RIGHT\u2019: TRUMP BUDGET CHIEF PICK RUSSELL VOUGHT FACES FIRE FROM DEM SENATORS\nPresident Donald Trump's nominee for Office of Management and Budget director, Russell Vought, testifies during the Senate Finance Committee nomination hearing in the Dirksen Senate Building on Jan. 22, 2025 in Washington, D.C.(Kayla Bartkowski\/Getty Images)\nVought\u2019s opponents voiced concern that his leadership would lead to more cases like thefreeze of federal grants and loans disclosed in an OMB memo on Jan. 27, a move that Democrats say was illegal and violated the Impoundment Control Act.\n\"As much as Trump desires it, the president is not a king,\" Senate Budget Committee ranking member Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told reporters on Jan. 28. \"As much as Trump desires it, a law is not a suggestion.\"\n\"These are not questions of opinion,\" Merkley said. \"These are principles at the heart of our constitutional system. It's at the heart of our checks and balances, and thus we have a constitutional crisis.\"\nVought repeatedly defended his stance that the Impoundment Control Act was unconstitutional in multiple confirmation hearings and claimed that presidents historically could spend less than what Congress had earmarked prior to 1974.\nProponents of executive impoundment frequently point to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s administration in 1803, when Congress appropriated funding for 15 gunboats. However, Jefferson held off on purchasing the boats to not aggravate France amid delicate discussions between then-Secretary of State James Madison and Napoleon. The purchase of the boats eventually became unnecessary following the Louisiana Purchase.\nAdditionally, Vought\u2019s Center for Renewing America, a nonprofit Vought founded in 2021, has said impoundment allows the executive branch to exert fiscal discipline and that the president has the authority to determine if funds are used in the most efficient manner.\nVought did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\nHowever, according to multiple legal experts, the Constitution and the courts are clear that spending appropriations fall under the parameters of the legislative branch.\nMichael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, told Fox News Digital, \"The president has the constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and that includes spending.\n\"So I don't know where Mr. Vought gets the view that somehow the president has the right to decide what the government is going to spend money on,\" he said. \"This is Congress' job.\"\nDespite Trump and Vought\u2019s views that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional, McConnell said that he believed there is \"no reasonable prospect that the court is going to agree with that.\n\"The person who would have been the recipient of the funding will have some standing to sue,\" McConnell said. \"So, I would assume that if there's an impoundment, there will be an immediate lawsuit under the Impoundment Control Act.\"\nTRUMP TREASURY PICK: EXTENDING TRUMP TAX CUTS \u2018SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ISSUE\u2019\nRussell Vought repeatedly defended his stance that the Impoundment Control Act was unconstitutional in multiple confirmation hearings.(Jacquelyn Martin\/The Associated Press\u00a0)\nOther legal experts agreed that should the Trump administration attempt to withhold funds, the courts would step in and assert that there is no legal basis to do so.\nThat is because this is not a murky legal issue, according to Georgetown Law professor Stephen Vladeck.\n\"There are contested issues of constitutional law, but this just isn't one of them,\" Vladeck told Fox News Digital. \"Were it otherwise, there wouldn't be much point in having a legislative branch.\"\nLegal experts claim the courts historically have upheld the constitutionality of the Impoundment Control Act, and point to the 1975 case Train v. City of New York. In that case, the Supreme Court determined the Environmental Protection Agency must use full funding included in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, even though then-President Richard Nixon issued orders not to use all the funding.\nVought himself admitted in a Jan. 22 confirmation hearing that no court of law has found the Impoundment Control Act unconstitutional.\nThe courts did step into action following the recent OMB memo outlining a pause in federal grants and loans, and two federal judges have temporarily blocked the freeze.\nAlthough the White House did rescind the memo pausing the federal aid on Jan. 29, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the move did not equate to a \"rescission of the federal funding freeze.\"\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on Vought's nomination and comments from Democrats that the memo was \"illegal.\"\nThe memo did not appear to alarm Republican leadership in Congress, who publicly characterized the pause as standard protocol during an administrative turnover.\n\"I think that's a normal practice at the beginning of administration, until they have an opportunity to review how the money is being spent,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters on Jan. 27. \"We'll see kind of what the extent of it is, and \u2026 what they intend to do in a more fulsome way. But for now, I think it's just, it's just kind of a preliminary step that I think most administrations take,\" Thune said.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also told reporters on Jan. 27 the memo did not concern him and that he \"fully\" supported it, labeling the directive a \"common application of common sense.\"\nEven so, the memo further intensified opposition to Vought\u2019s nomination. Specifically, Democrats urged the entire Senate to reject Vought\u2019s nomination on Jan. 30 in response, following a committee vote advancing his nomination to the Senate floor.\nMerkely noted that Vought oversaw the OMB in 2019 when the office held up $214 million in military aid for Ukraine \u2014 an issue that emerged as a key point in Trump\u2019s first impeachment. Ultimately, the Government Accountability Office determined in 2020 the move did violate the Impoundment Control Act, ahead of Trump's Senate impeachment trial. The Senate ultimately voted to acquit Trump.\nTherefore, Merkley characterized Vought as \"dangerously unfit\" to lead OMB and a \"dangerous threat to our constitutional system of representative democracy.\"\nJosh Chafetz, a professor at Georgetown Law, said such language such as \"constitutional crisis\" is reasonable considering Congress\u2019s spending power is one of the few but critical ways the legislative branch ensures the executive branch doesn\u2019t exert too much power.\n\"These kinds of impoundments are not just unconstitutional, but they're actually anti-constitutional,\" Chafetz told Fox News Digital. \"They strike at the very foundation of our constitutional order.\"\nDemocrats also don\u2019t believe the recent memo is an isolated incident. Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. cautioned on Jan. 30 thatVought would seek to withhold fundsagain overseeing OMB \u2014 if the Senate confirms him.\nVought himself signaled the Trump administration could initiate reform on impoundment law. In a confirmation hearing on Jan. 22, Vought told lawmakers that while an exact strategy is not intact yet, the Trump administration plans to complete a review with the Justice Department to explore the \"parameters of the law with regard to the Impoundment Control Act,\" should the Senate confirm him.\nVought also noted that some lawmakers who agree with his position on impoundment have proposed legislation on the matter. For example, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced legislation in December 2024 to repeal the Impoundment Control Act, arguing that the law\u2019s \"unconstitutional limitations\" on the executive branch have \"contributed to a fiscal crisis.\"\nGET TO KNOW DONALD TRUMP'S CABINET: WHO HAS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT PICKED SO FAR?\nSen.

{"title":"Here's how Trump's tariffs on China could impact drug pricing and other healthcare costs","date":1739145600000,"body":"Former economic advisors Robert Wolf and Steve Moore weigh in on how President Donald Trump's tariffs affect the economy, on 'America Reports.'\nPresidentDonald Trump'stariffs on China have raised significant concern over their potential impact on healthcare costs, but while the move could have a broad effect on the industry, it is likely they will not produce the devastating results that some may be expecting, health policy and trade experts say.\nA survey by market research group Black Book Research found that 84% of the healthcare consumers they questioned said they expect to see higher costs due to increased pricing on medical treatments and drugs as a result of Trump's new tariffs. Buthealth policyexpert Chris Pope posited that healthcare is \"not a very highly tradable sector\" and that the sectors that do rely on trade relations, like pharmaceutical drugs or medical devices, will hinge on the magnitude of any Trump tariffs.\n\"There's not much international trade for most of healthcare. The biggest parts of healthcare \u2013 physician services, these are all provided domestically already, and hospitals are a domestic part of healthcare, so you take out those two things, and you've kind of ruled out almost three-quarters of all healthcare spending,\" Pope said in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"So, for the most part, we're talking about drugs and devices, which are, at most, about a quarter of healthcare spending.\"\nDEMS CLAIM TRUMP TARIFF COULD \u2018DRIVE UP\u2019 COSTS DESPITE DEFLECTING BLAME FROM BIDEN'S INFLATION\n\"In terms of prices for the industry, whether it's absorbed in their margins, or they do lessresearch and development,or they pass it on to consumers \u2026 it's not completely devastating, but it's definitely annoying,\" said Christine McDaniel, a senior economist at George Mason University's Mercatus Institute.\nPicture of President Donald Trump alongside an image of someone dispensing pills from a pill bottle. Experts say Trump's tariffs could have a broad impact on the industry, and it is hard to predict, but added that it is likely they will not have the devastating impacts that some may think.(Fox News)\nExperts told Fox News that drug prices are among the most vulnerable aspects of the healthcare system, largely due to the U.S.' reliance on China for certain precursor chemicals and compounds that are essential for producing important medications. However, Pope said that the impact will likely only affect generic drugs and not branded drugs that are based on demand rather than supply. Generic drugs are already relatively cost-efficient, with many of them ranging under $10, he said.\nMonica de Bolle is an immunologist and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. She painted a bleaker picture of how many drugs could be impacted bythe tariffs.\n\u2018MAKING AMERICA EXPENSIVE AGAIN\u2019: DEMOCRATS FIND A TAX THEY DON'T LIKE IN TRUMP TARIFFS\n\"If you go through a list of the kinds of things that we import from China when it comes to active drug ingredients, or anything else that goes into the making of over-the-counter drugs, everything is in there. If you look at the list, it basically spans the range of potential medications that anyone takes at any point in their lives,\" said de Bolle. \"It includes things like over-the-counter NSAIDS, so non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs.\"\nShe added that drugs that are more dependent on China includemedications for anxietyand other psychiatric disorders, such as antidepressants, and following Trump's tariffs, \"those prices are going to go up, for sure,\" she said.\nRising drug costs have become a concern for many following President Donald Trump's tariffs on China, which the United States relies on for many less-advanced drugs.(iStock)\nExperts say costs in healthcare could also rise due to disruptions in thesupply chainfor medical devices, but they noted that the impact will be a lot harder to generalize, compared to the impact on drug pricing.\n\"Maybe before [the supply chain] was broken up into five stages. Well, now maybe they've broken it up into six or seven stages. So there are certain things that they have to stay in China for, or they have to source from China, but then they do the next step in India or another nearby country . . . which is going to be more expensive,\" McDaniel said.\n\u2018THIS IS ABOUT FENTANYL\u2019: TARIFFS ARE CRUCIAL TO COMBATING \u2018DRUG WAR,\u2019 TRUMP AND CABINET OFFICIALS SAY\nHowever, Pope argued that prices could change, depending on the device and the magnitude of Trump's tariffs.\n\"It's going to vary a lot, according to where the devices are manufactured, where the components are manufactured, what kind of subsidies are available from other countries and domestically, and the degree of retaliation,\" he said.\nThere is a debate about whether the U.S. should wean off its dependence on Chinese-manufactured drugs, like antibiotics.(AP Photo\/Kiichiro Sato)\nWhile Trump's tariffs might be new, the experts say that getting out of China is not. Reducing the U.S.' dependency on Chinese products tied to healthcare, particularly drugs like antibiotics, has been talked about among lawmakers for some time due to the potentialnational securityrisks. Parallel to these discussions, companies have been preparing for future tariffs in light of increased geopolitical tensions.\n\"There has been a lot of discussion coming from both theDemocratic camp,as well as the Republican one, about the necessity to bring some of the production of certain types of drugs back to the U.S. to reduce dependency on China,\" said de Bolle. \"This whole deal about drugs and medical equipment and all of that that was under discussion before Trump.

According to Dalio, investors are acutely aware of this, which is causing credit to get worse and interest rates to increase.\nDalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, says this is the worst thing that can happen to a heavily indebted entity. He notes that the key question is whether the debt creates a large enough income to mitigate this issue.\n\"That's like, I don't know, eating vegetables or something. It's a healthy process. And if not, credit begins to build up this debt, it begins to become like plaque in the arteries. And you can measure it just like you could measure it in the arteries, and you can see how it constricts that circulatory system,\" Dalio told \"All-In.\"\nSCOOP: KEY CONSERVATIVE CAUCUS DRAWS RED LINE ON HOUSE BUDGET PLAN\nRay Dalio, the founder of the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, warned \"The All-In Podcast\" co-host David Friedberg of serious economic consequences is the national debt is not addressed quickly.(The All-In Podcast)\nIf interest and debt service continuously constrict a government's money supply, Dalio claims this can lead to an \"economic debt heart attack.\"\nA large amount of debt creates the need for somebody to buy it. Debt risks not only create the urgency for new supply to be offered, but holders may also sell those debt assets, leading to an overwhelming supply relative to demand, according to Dalio.\nIn the event that the debt service burden rises or there is a big supply-demand imbalance, the government's central bank can print more money and buy it. If they do not, the price of the debt must rise to constrict borrowing, snowballing to the constriction of non-existent credit, in turn weakening the economy and causing bad economic conditions.\nDalio says the government can let that happen or print money and buy the debt to monetize it.

Peterson Foundation\/Chip Somodevilla\/Getty Images)\nToday, the U.S. has $36.4 trillion offederal government debtand a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 29.1 trillion, giving a debt-to-GDP ratio of 125%. This ratio has climbed steadily since the pandemic began in 2020, when the federal government debt was $20 trillion, and GDP was just $21 trillion. Since the pandemic, federal government debt has risen by 80%, while GDP has climbed by 38%.\nDespite recent efforts to cut interest rates again, markets have traded treasuries down, causing the long-term interest rates of U.S. debt to spike up to levels not felt since just before the 2008 global financial crisis. To keep the economy growing, the U.S. government is running a nearly $2 trillion annual deficit, nearly 7% of GDP, while paying over $1 trillion per year in interest alone on the existing outstanding debt.\nDalio expressed a sense of urgency in relation to mounting debt, wading into the potential benefits of theDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE)and how the need to cut costs will inevitably accentuate already entrenched political divisions.\nTouting his personal solution, Dalio said the deficit, which is the equivalent of bonds selling, must be cut from 7.5 percent down to 3 percent of GDP.\nDOGE ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $1B IN SAVINGS AFTER CANCELING 104 FEDERAL DEI CONTRACTS\nCongress is racing to execute the recommendations of Trump's new DOGE commission.(Getty Images)\n\"Different people have different views as to how to cut it. Forget it. I don't really care,\" Dalio said. \"Just, you have to have a unified agreement. Everybody in Congress and the president and so on should pledge to do that. And then the question is how to do it. But they should know that number (equivalent to around 900 billion a year).\"\nDalio worries that the timeline to close this gap may be too long. He says it's not just a matter of DOGE but also less regulation and productivity changes, which could, in part, come from artificial intelligence (AI) or even revenue produced by tariffs and translate into profit.\nWhen asked if America is better off withPresident Donald Trumpversus former President Biden in the financial context, Dalio said, \"Yes, I do believe we are.\"\n\"In terms of profitability and the likelihood of cutting, I think the Republicans are probably more likely to make these moves than the Democrats. But you also have to take into consideration the impacts, the social impacts and the other impacts that are going to come from this. We're at a civil war internally and we're at an international war simultaneously. So, there are second-order effects. I think the main thing is to take those numbers and make them real at 3 percent,\" he continued.\nTOP DOGE LAWMAKER SAYS TRUMP \u2018ALREADY RACKING UP WINS FOR TAXPAYERS\u2019 WITH EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES\nPie chart on government spending.(Fox News)\nBut these cuts will be brutal, according to Dalio.

It's too much of a \u2013 but you're absolutely right. Lots of jobs are going to be lost,\" he said. \"Lots of change is going to happen in terms of turbulence. And do we have a plan?

Luvu was trying to prevent Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts from sneaking into the end zone behind his massive linemen.\nHochuli slid the ball closer to the goal line after each infraction. \"Half the distance to the goal line\" is the sanction, meaning the ball advanced a few centimeters each time and Philadelphia got a new set of downs. But following the second infraction, Hochuli announced he\u2019d assess Luvu an unsportsmanlike penalty if he did it again.\nSPENDING SHOWDOWN: REPUBLICANS WILL NEED TO CORRAL VOTES \u2013 BUT THEY HAVEN'T ASKED, YET\nLuvu didn\u2019t.\nBut on the third play, Washington defensive tackle Jonathan Allen hopped briefly offside before the snap.\nHochuli blew the whistle, assessed a penalty for encroachment and moved the ball forward until its nose practically kissed the goal line chalk.\nUnlike football, there's no obscure, baked-in rule allowing detractors of a \"palpably unfair\" act to supersede it \u2013 which might just spell hard luck for critics of President Trump's freezing of already-allocated federal funds.(Chip Somodevilla\/Getty Images)\nThe referee then tutored the nation on one of the most obscure rules in any athletic rulebook.\n\"Washington has been advised that the referees can award a score if this type of behavior happens again,\" said Hochuli, much to the delight of the partisan crowd stuffed into Lincoln Financial Field in south Philly.\nThe rule declares the following:\n\"A player or substitute shall not interfere with play by any act which is palpably unfair. Penalty: For a palpably unfair act: Offender may be disqualified. The referee, after consulting the officiating crew, enforces any such distance penalty they consider equitable and irrespective of any other specified code penalty. The referee may award a score.\"\nTHE POLITICAL FIRESTORM THAT'S ABOUT TO SINGE CAPITOL HILL\nIn short, had Washington committed another penalty, Hochuli could have quit creeping the ball toward the goal line. He would have just given the Eagles six points on the scoreboard.\nRule 12, Section 3, Article 4 does not exist in governance or politics. Except the voters, there is no referee like Shawn Hochuli to assess penalties, mete out discipline and dock a team yardage.\nAnd this is what vexes Democrats \u2013 and some Republicans \u2013 when it comes toTrump Administrationmoves to freeze money appropriated by Congress across the board.\nArticle I, Section 9 of the Constitution makes delegation of spending powers very clear \u2013 which is a big reason why Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is so controversial on Capitol Hill.(Anna Moneymaker)\nArticle I, Section 9 of the Constitution is clear about which branch of government controls the purse strings:\"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\"\nIn other words, Congress is responsible for spending money. The executive branch just cannot unilaterally thwart what Congress spends. President Richard Nixon tried this in the mid-1970s with \"impoundment.\" Nixon\u2019s administration blocked spending money which Congress allocated.\nMUSK'S DOGE TAKES AIM AT 'VIPER'S NEST' FEDERAL AGENCY WITH GLOBAL FOOTPRINT\nThis is whyElon Musk\u2019s\"Department of Government Efficiency\" or \"DOGE\" is so controversial. First of all, it\u2019s not a \"department\" like the State Department or the Department of Energy. It\u2019s really the \"U.S. DOGE Service,\" positioned under the umbrella of a small agency within the executive branch: The U.S. Digital Service.\nBut President Trump has granted Elon Musk and his team access to probe ways to cut spending. The DOGE service can\u2019t just cut spending on its own. At least not constitutionally. And it certainly can\u2019t eliminate another agency, like the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID.\nUnless Congress says so.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., called the president's \"temporary\" pause on federal grants and loans \"normal practice\" for the fledgling second Trump administration.(Getty Images)\nThat\u2019s why the drama last week about an automatic freeze on federal grants and loans rattled lawmakers from both parties onCapitol Hill. Granted, the administration called for a \"temporary\" pause. And even some powerful Republicans were okay with that.\n\"I think that's a normal practice at the beginning of administration until we have an opportunity to know how the money is being spent,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., about the halt. \"I think it's just this is kind of a preliminary step that I think most administrations take.\"\nBut Congress generally safeguards its prerogatives of spending very closely. It would be remarkable for lawmakers to fork over fiscal responsibilities to the executive branch without a fight.\nTHE POLITICAL FIRESTORM THAT'S ABOUT TO SINGE CAPITOL HILL\nThis is why when granting a restraining order to quash moves by the administration to usurp congressional authority over spending, U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan declared that there was potential for \"irreparable harm\" to federal agencies and that the administration\u2019s actions could be \"catastrophic.\"\nRepublicans raised few hackles about the administration\u2019s decisions. But Democrats and their allies spelled out the gravity of the circumstances.\n\"This is a profound Constitutional issue,\" argued Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. \"What happened last night is the most direct assault on the authority of Congress, I believe in the history of the United States. It is blatantly unconstitutional.

You cannot wave away an agency that you don't like,\" said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii.\n\"Just like Elon Musk did not create USAID, he doesn't have the power to destroy it,\" said Rep.

Econ 101 says they shouldn\u2019t worry","date":1738540800000,"body":"Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on the impact of DeepSeek AI on U.S. tech stocks and reactions to the innovation on \u2018Fox News @ Night.\u2019\nIf you care about national security, artificial intelligence (AI) or the index funds in your retirement account, you have likely heard of DeepSeek.Chinese AI model DeepSeek\u2019s releaselate January caused\u00a0a $969 billion stock market selloff\u00a0and prompted responses from AI leaders like President Donald Trump, NVIDIA,\u00a0venture capitalist\u00a0Marc Andreessen and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\nDeepSeek is aChinese AI modelsimilar to those which run famous programs like ChatGPT. The difference? This one is reportedly 40-50 times cheaper to train, which some think implies we have invested 40-50 times too much in AI chips and infrastructure.\nIf panicked stock sellers and pessimists are to be believed, DeepSeek is some sort of kryptonite whose existence implies China will do to American AI what it did to American toy manufacturing.\nTHERE IS A 'WAKE-UP CALL' FOR US TO BE THE LEADER IN AI, SAYS WHITE HOUSE AI AND CRYPTO \u2018CZAR\u2019\nThis is nonsense. DeepSeek\u2019s figures are bullish for American AI if true and bullish for American AI if false. Here\u2019s why:\nThe furor over China's DeepSeek AI is overstated. But U.S. firms can't ignore it either.\nAnd since when do lower costs and lower barriers to entry mean lower demand?\nDeepSeek runs on the following layers:\nChina's DeepSeek AI relied on chips from NVIDIA, even though it's banned from export to China.(Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images)\nThe physical chips used were NVIDIA H800s, a downgraded version of the popular H100 chip. Both have been banned by the U.S. for export to China, proving again that President Joe Biden\u2019s export bans are useless and merely force China to become more innovative.\nThe other models used to train DeepSeek reflect the sustained need for massive compute and reliance on American models. Per Rand\u2019s Lennart Heim,\n\"DeepSeek operated Asia's first 10,000 Nvidia A100 cluster, reportedly maintains 50,000 'Hoppers' (which could be Nvidia's H100, H800, or H20), and has additional unlimited access to Chinese and foreign cloud providers (which is not export-controlled). This extensive compute access was likely crucial for developing their efficiency techniques through trial and error and for serving their models to customers.\"\nIn addition, there is mounting evidence that DeepSeek is a distillation (in essence a copy) of American AI leader OpenAI\u2019s latest models. OpenAI says it is looking into this possibility.\nThis means that the remaining component, the final model brought to market, also would depend on American AI. On top of early incidental finds by AI developers independently investigating the matter, Microsoft has joined OpenAI in looking into the depth of DeepSeek\u2019s alleged copying.\nEven if China suddenly decided it likes telling the truth and DeepSeek did cost less than $6 million to train, it required indirect access to nearly a billion dollars of American compute. Analysis by SemiAnalysis suggests DeepSeek\u2019s capital expenditure was closer to $1.6billion, with $944 million of this cost dedicated to the cost of compute. Hardly the garage band operation the headlines would suggest.\nThe $6M number is misleading by many orders of magnitude. And even if it wasn\u2019t, DeepSeek would be no NVIDIA-pocalypse unless we thought all future models would be mere distillations of existing ones. DeepSeek is an affirmation of American AI leadership and a reminder that value lies in AI infrastructure and customer-facing products themselves, not in closed-source models.\nIn addition, there is mounting evidence that DeepSeek is a distillation (in essence a copy) of American AI leader OpenAI\u2019s latest models. OpenAI says it is looking into this possibility.\nAs Andreessen said, this is AI\u2019s Sputnik moment. America received a reminder that a rival is further ahead in a critical technology than we had previously thought, that innovations lead to lower barriers to entry and lower costs to catch up, and that we should not take our leadership for granted.\nHere\u2019s what Americans should take away:\nBiden's AI restrictions were a failure and DeepSeek's reliance on U.S. tech proves it.(AP Photo\/Carolyn Kaster)\nThis competition runs on open-source (publicly available) science. We do not have a technical moat and will win only through a continued emphasis on speed and quality. Export controls only work for high-complexity products with decades-long development cycles.\nAmerica\u2019s AI industry is safe if it continues its momentum.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nOthers still depend directly and indirectly on American models and chips. It is beneficial to have our rivals depend on us. Resource deprivation breeds innovation and expansionism. Just ask Imperial Japan\nMeanwhile, AI costs will come down for everyone. Computers and machine learning algorithms become cheaper over time, and there is no credible reason to bank on a ceiling or \"peak AI.\"\nAmerica received a reminder that a rival is further ahead in a critical technology than we had previously thought, that innovations lead to lower barriers to entry and lower costs to catch up, and that we should not take our leadership for granted.\nDeepSeek\u2019s only clear innovations are aspects of its training methods, and we have the scale to make superior use of them if we have the will and humility to do so. If DeepSeek can derive a workable copy from a larger model for less than $6 million, imagine how this capability will compound and accelerate model development for companies like OpenAI and Google ready to deploy hundreds of millions of dollars.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn the words of Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, \"We need to make sure we set standards that the world meets. And I think that's the way we'll keep our lead. Do it the American way, which we know is the winning way.\"\nDeepSeek is a fire drill and a reminder to prepare for the real thing. In the meantime, we should heed the reminder that we can\u2019t be complacent with our current leadership. Instead, we must do what we do best: focus on winning.

{"title":"Gen Z plans micro-retirement when they\u2019ve barely started working","date":1738454400000,"body":"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nGeneration Z has now come up with another new term you\u2019ll be hearing more about, it\u2019s called \"micro-retirement.\" The concept of \"micro-retirement\" is totake time from workwhile you are still young, rather than deferring all your future leisure plans to the later years of life.\nSome people just call this being unemployed for a while. Others call it taking a sabbatical from work. This new trend is sweeping through Generation Z and are they on to something smart or is this going to create aneven more cratering financial effecton their financial future?\nOK. I must make a confession. At 55 years old, it\u2019s hard to get my head wrapped around needing a big \u2018break from work\u2019 in your 20s.\nTRUMP'S ULTIMATUM TO FEDERAL WORKERS: RETURN TO OFFICE 'OR BE TERMINATED'\nBrittney Foley, 26, is a woman who is opting for a micro-retirement. She explained that taking smaller career breaks earlier in your life is perfect when you don\u2019t have kids as you can quite literally do whatever you want. This is assuming you can afford it. Although, with national credit card debt at a staggering $1.2 trillion and the average credit card balance soaring past $6,000, can Generation Z really afford it?\nSome Gen Z workers have a different view of work, even pursuing the idea of micro-retirement.(Wealth of Geeks)\nBrittney said, \"With other people my age, there\u2019s so much pressure to chase promotion cycles and raises, andeveryone is so burnt out.\"Burnt out? At 26?\nThis generation has decided to flip the script of how they view their own financial plan, which is live for today and don\u2019t worry about tomorrow.\nThere is a much more cynical view from people in their 20s that they will be able to afford a home, retire comfortably and reap the benefits of Social Security. So, we are witnessing a counterculture of younger people turning the retirement script upside down with this idea of having three- to six-month breaks in between their next career move.\nA very close friend of mine has a daughter who left Google recently at the age of 30. She had done very well there, rising through the ranks and building an income of almost $300,000. But, feeling the passion to live for today, she quit the job and is currently living for four months in Hawaii and then off to two months in Bali before she figures out her next career move. Is this something that Boomers and Gen Xers should have done when they were younger?\nThe phrase micro-retirement was first described in \"The 4-Hour Workweek,\" a self-help and careers guidance book published by the entrepreneur Tim Ferris in 2007. \u00a0However, most young people may not fully think about the financial consequences of these mini-retirement decisions.\nYour 401k\/retirement savings:For Gen Z workers, they need to look closely at the matching and profit-sharing contributions from their company. Often, these contributions made by the employer have a vesting schedule and it could be a horrific financial move to walk away from unvested money that could have a substantial impact on your retirement balances over the long haul.\nYour ability to earn the same income \u2026 or more:The strategy of micro-retirement assumes you\u2019ll be able to re-enter the workplace quickly and at the same income or more. Part of growing your income, bonuses and potentially company stock is often tied to your tenure with a company.\nIt\u2019s unknown yet how employers will view someone who has two, three, or four breaks in their resume to micro-retire and whether they will want to hire that person knowing they could quit in a couple of years after the employer invested tons of time and money training that new employee.\nThis generation has decided to flip the script of how they view their own financial plan, which is live for today and don\u2019t worry about tomorrow.\nYour Social Security:While some Gen Z workers believe they will never see a dime of Social Security, it\u2019s important to account for how a break in your income will affect your long-term Social Security. It\u2019s likely the full retirement age for those in their 20s will be past the age of 67, but having gaps of income could make your overall Social Security lower down the road and impact your overall retirement.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nDebt:What\u2019s most worrisome aspect of this new trend is the debt that younger workers in America may take on to achieve a mini retirement. Most people in retirement aren\u2019t jet-setting around the world and often these micro-retirement breaks are partnered with exotic vacations or luxury travel which could increase the debt load on younger people.\nThis new trend that emerged on TikTok sees Gen Z workers from around the world vowing to take periodic breaks from the office to protect their \"mental health\" \u2014 despite being several decades away from the retirement age.\nOn one hand, I\u2019ve done financial plans for many people in their 40s and 50s who are seeking an early retirement to start to enjoy their hard-earned money and savings. However, many of those people often worry about running out of money, so they\u2019ll extend the amount of time they work another five or 10 years to be sure they have enough retirement savings to do whatever they want to do in retirement. In some cases, health issues that arise like a bad knee or hip or something even more consequential may stop them from fully enjoying the assets that they have saved up.\nYou could say it\u2019s irresponsible to not focus on saving and planning for your future to just enjoy every nickel and more that you have in the bank today.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nYou are not only applying a much narrower window of achieving retirement success with micro-retirement, but it could also cost America billions of dollars to take care of people who didn\u2019t save because they wanted to spend their money today. Are you ready to bail out people for their future retirement like people got bailed out for college loans?\nSo, who has it right? Those of us that toil away, max out our 401(k), pay down our house quicker and save that bucket list for when we retire? Or does Gen Z have it right with the attitude that tomorrow is never promised, who knows when we will have a COVID-19 like event again? You should just sit back, assume you\u2019ll work forever, and soak up as much fun as you can when you are in your 20s and 30s? Time will tell if this is another fad, or it will become a staple of how people live in the future.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY TED JENKIN\nTed Jenkin is president ofExit Stage Left Advisorsand partner atExit Wealth.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/gen-z-plans-micro-retirement-when-theyve-barely-started-working","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":0,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":0,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

Nelson explains what drew him to his new movie, \"Green and Gold,\" specifically the story that he felt connected to.\nWhen I think of the farmers I grew up around, I think of resilience and stewardship. These are people who rise before the sun, work tirelessly to feed not only their families but all of us and endure hardships most of us cannot imagine. Yet the headlines about America\u2019s farming recession remind us of just how much they shoulder \u2014 and how little recognition they often receive.\nAs an actor, recognition finds you whether you want it or not. While the work is meaningful, it can pale compared to the daily hours, grit and commitment farming families dedicate daily. There is no craft services table waiting for them \u2014 they are feeding everyone else.\nFarming is not just a job\u2014 it is a calling.Theirs is often an unnoticed sacrifice, from the long hours and rising costs to the unpredictable weather and policy challenges. A single bag of corn seed now costs $230, nearly double the price of a few years ago. Combine that with declining crop prices, and farmers must navigate a system stacked against them. Yet they persevere because their work feeds millions and sustains communities.\nKELSEY GRAMMER SAYS CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT IS LOOKING \u2018MORE ATTRACTIVE\u2019 TO HOLLYWOOD\nMy great-grandfather, Gulbrand Nelson, left Norway to settle in Wisconsin before moving to South Dakota, whereour family farm still standstoday. That upbringing instilled in me the importance of values, tradition and faith \u2014 ideals I see fading as time passes. If we let them fade long enough, they will vanish.\nActor Craig T. Nelson stars in the new film \"Green and Gold.\" Nelson grew up in a farming family and knows how important feeding America really is.\nI\u2019ve been blessed in my career with the ability to do things I believe in. At this stage in my life, it has become all the more important to work on projects that matter to me and the legacy I will leave to my children, grandchildren and those who have entrusted me with their viewing time over the years.\nMy family's heritage inspired me to take on one such projectcalled \"Green and Gold,\"a film that reflects the spirit of farming families and their struggles today. The project embodies what I value most: resilience, stewardship, and legacy. It is a tribute to the farmers who quietly hold our country together.\nGrowing up near farming communities, I saw firsthand what that perseverance looks like: long days in the fields, families working through mechanical failures or harsh weather, and a deep-rooted pride in their labor. Those experiences shaped my values and the stories I want to tell.\nWhen I was offered the opportunity to be part of \"Green and Gold,\" I knew it was more than a role \u2014 it was a chance to honor the legacy of farming families. The film highlights their resilience and quiet strength, reminding us of their vital contributions to our country.\nFarmers are America's backbone. Their stewardship of the land reflects faith, responsibility and commitment to something greater than themselves. Yet, they are often left to face economic and policy challenges alone. This farming recession is not just a farming issue but a national one. Rural communities are struggling, and the ripple effects will touch us all. We must do more than recognize farmers in times of crisis. We must advocate for policies that support them, invest in rural infrastructure, and champion their contributions to our everyday lives.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nBeyond the economic struggles, farming takes an emotional toll. In conversations with farmers, while preparing for \"Green and Gold,\" I heard pride in their work and concern about the future. Who will carry on their legacy? Will their children want to inherit the struggles that come with it? These are not just questions \u2014 they are the realities shaping rural America today.\nWe owe so much to our farmers. They feed us, clothe us and sustain our economy. Their work is woven into the fabric of our history, yet their voices are often absent from national conversations. By telling their stories \u2014 on screen and off \u2014 we can honor their contributions and address their challenges.\nMy great-grandfather, Gulbrand Nelson, left Norway to settle in Wisconsin before moving to South Dakota, where our family farm still stands today.\nTake a moment to reflect on the farmers behind the meals you eat and the clothes you wear.

For example, a dozen Grade A large eggs cost an average of $4.15 in December \u2014 up from $2.51 in December 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nIn some states like California, those numbers have gone up to nearly $9 per dozen in certain areas. California, like other states including Arizona, Massachusetts and Michigan, requires all eggs sold in the state to come from cage-free hens, which typically are more expensive.\nThe rise in egg prices comes amid high demand and a massive outbreak of avian flu, known as the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture attributes to killing more than 20 million egg-laying hens in the last quarter of 2024. All birds from an infected flock are culled, exacerbating the impact of the flu.\nLeavitt on Tuesday blamed this killing policy for contributing to the egg shortage.\n\"The Biden Administration\u2019s slow and ineffective response to the avian influenza outbreak, which began in 2022, has negatively impacted U.S. poultry producers, and his USDA forced farmers to massively cut their livestock populations,\" Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary, said in a Monday statement to Fox News Digital.\nAs a result, Kelly said Trump and Rollins would\u00a0take \"bold, decisive action\" to address problems related to the avian flu, and direct the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to refocus on the health of animals and plants.\nDemocrats previously have questioned Trump\u2019s ability to reduce grocery prices, and Rep.

He recently said, \"House Democrats will work to find bipartisan common ground whenever and wherever possible with the incoming administration.\"\nIndeed, moderate Democrats should take the lead and work with their GOP colleagues to forge compromise where it can easily be found. Securing the border, for example, is a commonsense policy that both parties can work towards together.\nMoreover, by working with Republicans, Democrats would be able to ensure some of their own policies make it into final legislation.\nReturning to the border and immigration, a compromise could surely be struck that minimizes the extent of Trump\u2019s planned mass deportations by limiting them to adults who entered the country illegally and those who have committed crimes while here.\nIn exchange, Democrats could push for a pathway to citizenship for children who were brought here.\nFurther, bipartisan efforts can be made to increase the number of H1B visas for the highest skilled migrants so that America preserves its technological advantage over China.\nOver the objections of many on the far-right, Trump recently came out in support of the H1B program. Democrats should take him up on that in exchange for wholly necessary steps to address illegal immigration.\nSimilarly, a moderate Democratic agenda must entail the end of support for sanctuary cities and soft-on-crime policies. Too often, progressives have been allowed to dictate Democrats\u2019 position on these related issues, damaging the entire party.\nWith pre-election polling from Fox News showing that voters trusted Donald Trump rather than VP Kamala Harris by wide margins on issues like immigration (+15%), as well as the economy and crime (+8% each), doubling down on resistance would be a costly mistake.\nTo be sure, while immigration is one high-profile area for compromise, Democrats would be wise to adopt a moderate agenda across the board.\nOn the economy, there are middle-of-the-road policies that can keep taxes low, spur growth, and lower the cost of living \u2013 an issue that seriously hurt Democrats in the election.\nA key part of this would be working with Republicans to reform education and job training programs.\nThere are potential deals to be made that increase funding for vocational training and school choice programs while also making education more accessible for all Americans.\nU.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY, has indicated that he understands the importance of this cooperation with the new administration.(Drew Angerer\/Getty Images)\nIn that same vein, with Republicans targeting federal spending, Democrats must finally admit that they cannot simply spend with impunity.\nThe national debt, now sitting at more than $36 trillion was a significant concern for voters, and the combination of inflation and high interest rates needed to combat it risk strangling the American economy.\nBy working with the Department of Government Efficiency, Democrats can contribute to reining in the debt while protecting core programs such as social security and Medicare.\nFinally, even though foreign policy is largely the purview of the president, the challenge for Democrats here is two-fold.\nThey must embrace a more moderate foreign policy that recognizes the need to expand the Abraham Accords and support Israel, while finding a compromise with Trump on other issues.\nUnder President Joe Biden, America\u2019s foreign policy was often prodding, weak, and relied on the misguided strategy of \"diplomacy at all costs.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nDemocrats should look to support Trump\u2019s more muscular foreign policy, in exchange for Trump\u2019s commitment to NATO and not forcing Ukraine into a deal that overly favors Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTaken together, Democrats would be wise to heed the lessons of former President Bill Clinton. During my time in that administration, Clinton moved to the right on certain issues \u2013 the debt, crime and welfare reform \u2013 taking the mantle from Republicans and contributing to a boost in his approval.\nOver the objections of many on the far-right, Trump recently came out in support of the H1B program. Democrats should take him up on that in exchange for wholly necessary steps to address illegal immigration.\nUltimately, during and after Trump\u2019s first 100 days, Democrats cannot afford a strategy of total resistance, lest they be consigned to minority status for the foreseeable future.\nIf Democrats hope to demonstrate that they are a viable alternative, they must develop a new, moderate agenda that shows the American people that they are capable of putting actual governance over petty politics.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nImportantly, this is not to say that Democrats need to surrender on everything, particularly on issues that go against their core principles.\nRather, it is to underscore that working with Trump and Republicans to find compromise and address issues facing all Americans is to everyone\u2019s benefit.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DOUG SCHOEN\nDouglas E.

{"title":"If Trump is serious about helping working families, here\u2019s what we can do together","date":1737331200000,"body":"Democratic strategist David Axelrod told CNN that he\u2019s open to President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s success during his second term, telling CNN anchor Anderson Cooper on Monday night that he\u2019d be pleased if Trump was able to get much of his agenda done.\nThis past November, I was honored when voters inmy great state of Nevadareelected me to the United States Senate. In that same election, Nevadans also voted to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States, the first Republican presidential candidate to win the state since 2004. One of the defining issues in both our races was the high cost of living, which is squeezing hardworking Nevada families and creating financial hardship. Families are frustrated with the elevated prices they are seeing, and they have every right to be. During the election, voters made their economic frustration clear at the ballot box.\nAmericans work hard every day, but many are still struggling to get by because prices have skyrocketed over the last few years, from the grocery store to the gas pump. This has forced families all over the country to make difficult choices about whether to put food on the table, keep a roof over their heads or fill up their tanks. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been pushing Washington to take action tolower costs for familiesand reduce their financial burden, to give them much-needed breathing room.\nSince coming to Congress,I\u2019ve been clear that I will work with anyone \u2013 regardless of party or ideology \u2013 to deliver for families in my state. I\u2019m focused on results, not playing politics. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve repeatedly been ranked as one of the nation\u2019s most bipartisan and independent senators. We certainly won\u2019t agree on every issue, but if Trump is serious about providing financial relief for hardworking families by lowering costs, then I\u2019m willing to try to work with him on that. Here are a few ways that we can start.\nDUFFY CONFIRMATION HEARING MARKED BY BIPARTISANSHIP, PLEDGE TO VISIT HELENE-DEVASTATED STATES\nOne of Trump\u2019s most notable promises on the campaign trail, one that he unveiled in Nevada, was to end taxes on tips for service workers. Growing up in a working-class family and working as a waitress while I went to school, I know what it\u2019s like to work multiple jobs and rely on tips to help make ends meet. I\u2019ve never forgotten where I came from, and I\u2019m not afraid to embrace a good idea, even if it comes from the other side of the aisle.\nThere is potential for both parties to find bipartisan ways to help working families.(iStock)\nThat\u2019s why I was quick to support this proposal last Congress and will be supporting legislation to implement it again this year. By ending income taxes on tips, with guardrails to prevent the ultra-wealthy like CEOs from exploiting loopholes, we can ensure that Americans keep more of their hard-earned money.\nAnother idea brought up during the campaign was to cut taxes for hardworking families by extending and increasing the Child Tax Credit. In fact, Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance called for it to be raised to $5,000. This tax credit has been a major lifeline for working families in Nevada and across the country who are doing their best to keep their heads above water.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThat extra money makes a world of difference for families that are now able to afford quality childcare, buy essentials like diapers and baby wipes, or pay for a visit to the doctor. By lowering the tax burden for families through an enhanced Child Tax Credit, we\u2019re investing in American families and strengthening our country as a result.\nWe can also work together to make it easier for families to rent or own a home across the nation. Trump and I have both called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would help lower home prices. We also need to strengthen the United States\u2019 construction workforce and increase our housing supply, which would lower costs and help more families find an affordable place to live. And we can take steps to make more federally owned land available for the responsible development of affordable housing.\nOne of Trump\u2019s most notable promises on the campaign trail, one that he unveiled in Nevada, was to end taxes on tips for service workers. Growing up in a working-class family and working as a waitress while I went to school, I know what it\u2019s like to work multiple jobs and rely on tips to help make ends meet. I\u2019ve never forgotten where I came from, and I\u2019m not afraid to embrace a good idea, even if it comes from the other side of the aisle.\nAs Congress and the incoming administration continue to negotiate the upcoming comprehensive tax package, we must focus on making sure that it provides meaningful tax relief for America\u2019s middle class. Individuals, families and small businesses deserve breathing room and peace of mind. We can deliver by making sure this package primarily benefits them, not the ultra-wealthy and major corporations.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhat we need are commonsense, forward-thinking economic policies that put the American people first. That\u2019s why I am deeply concerned about Trump\u2019s plan to enact sweeping tariffs. This would lead to higher prices that Americans would have to pay at the checkout counter, and it would devastate working families\u2019 budgets. This is no way to help working people, and I hope he quickly recognizes the harm that broad tariffs would cause to consumers.\nHardworking Americans face real financial challenges that impact their lives every day. We can work together to bring down costs and set families up for success. I am willing to work with anyone from any party to make this happen. By working together \u2014 Democrats and Republicans, President-elect Trump and Congress \u2014 we can help make the American Dream a reality \u2014 one that is affordable for all Americans to pursue.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JACKY ROSEN\nJacky Rosen, a Democrat, represents Nevada in the U.S. Senate.","url":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/trump-serious-about-helping-working-families-heres-what-can-do-together","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0,"topic_inflation":1,"topic_taxes":1,"topic_stocks":0,"topic_jobs":1,"topic_housing":1,"topic_energy":1,"topic_crypto":0}

ESG seems to be coming unglued. But don\u2019t be fooled.\nA closer look at what the banks have said reveals that they are still full of unrepentant ESG financiers. Many of the touted changes are superficial or cosmetic rather than indicative of an underlying philosophical shift.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion initiatives have been the subject of heated opinions of praise and rebuke.(Adobe Stock)\nDozens of Fortune 500 companies (includingMcDonald's and\u00a0Walmart) representing trillions of dollars of market cap and millions of employees\u00a0rolled back or nixed their DEI programs in 2024. ESG-labeled investment funds\u00a0hemorrhaged cash over the past two years. And the incoming administration has promised to\u00a0jettison DEI in federal agencies.\nDEI IS LIKE A WOKE IED FOR THE LEFT\u2019S WAR AGAINST OUR MILITARY. WE MUST DEFUSE IT\nThe Net-Zero Insurance Alliance has fallen apart with the mass\u00a0exodus of insurance companies over the past year and a half when many state attorneys general\u00a0expressed concern that participating in such an alliance might violate anti-trust and anti-collusion laws. U.S. states have\u00a0withdrawn billions of dollars from Blackrock due to concerns about ESG.\nThese changes are welcome corrections to the flawed and deeply ideological goals of ESG advocates. The latest dominos to fall are large American financial institutions.Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan have all\u00a0withdrawn from the global Net-Zero Banking Alliance.\nEven Blackrock, once a vocal advocate of ESG, withdrew from Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Though this may appear to be of a piece with other rollbacks of ESG, cynicism is warranted.\nIf you look at the press releases from these large financial institutions, you\u2019ll find that they are unrepentant and still intend to pursue net zero goals. For example, Goldman\u00a0stated:\"Our priorities remain to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals and to measure and report on our progress.\"Citigroup was even more\u00a0blunt: \"we remain committed to reaching net zero.\"\nI WAS FORCED TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST MY SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HALT COMPELLED SPEECH, RACIST DEI\nBlackrock has beenthe most\u00a0explicitly unrepentant. \"[O]ur memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion\u2026 and subjected us to legal inquiries\u2026 [But this] does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.\" Translation: \"We just want to distance ourselves from problematic PR, but we are not changing a single thing about how we do business.\"\nThe moves by these large banks seem to imitate Blackrock CEO Larry Fink\u2019s strategy of not\u00a0using the term \"ESG\" because it was a political hot potato, but remaining committed to \"sustainability.\" Blackrock remains heavily\u00a0invested in green infrastructure and renewable energy projects.\nThat\u2019s fine if their clients explicitly ask for such investments. But as American Airlines\u00a0learned last week, pension fund managers have a fiduciary obligation to pursue the best financial returns for their clients and they can be held liable for using the funds they manage for other ends.\nNEARLY HALF OF ALL US COLLEGE STUDENTS REJECT MANDATORY DEI COURSES ON CAMPUS: STUDY\nWhile superficial progress has been made with U.S. financial institutions withdrawing from destructive global net-zero alliances, they appear insincere when it comes to truly changing their ways. This should not be surprising given that bank personnel have not changed much. Nor do we see evidence of a change of heart when it comes to ESG.\nInstead, they seem concerned about public pressure and criticism from theincoming federal administrationand from state government officials. Withdrawing from these alliances also gives them a freer hand to signal net zero intentions without having to deliver on them by a fixed date.\nBut if ESG policy was\u00a0distracting and\u00a0destructive before, it is still so now. Ideological ESG priorities detract from companies\u2019 ability to function well and benefit their contractual stakeholders. Companies have a hard enough time being profitable without pursuing various social justice priorities.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nBanks would do better to clarify their commitment to maximizing shareholder value and doing business with everyone. Pursuing long-term profit successfully benefits shareholders, workers, suppliers and customers.\nMost corporations, especially the unrepentant financiers, need to clean house in their human resources departments to focus on value creation rather than racial identity politics or costly virtue-signaling on environmental and social issues.

It\u2019s about continuing and expanding the policies from the first Trump administration \u2014 policies that worked,\" Turner said Thursday. He added that his \"goal\" as HUD secretary will be \"to help people get off government assistance, become self-sustainable and achieve the American dream.\"\nTurner previously served as executive director of the Trump administration\u2019s Opportunity and Revitalization Council that established\"Opportunity Zones,\"an economic revitalization plan aimed at helping low-income, minority communities, which Turner said he hopes to expand. Turner also said he plans to cut red tape, engage with state, local and private partners to improve the cost of housing and \"maximize\" HUD's current budget.\n\u2018CLEAR VISION\u2019: CONSERVATIVES RALLY AROUND HEGSETH AFTER \u2018CRUSHING\u2019 FIERY CONFIRMATION HEARING\nEric Scott Turner, President-elect Trump's nominee to be secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is sworn in during a Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs hearing for his pending confirmation on Capitol Hill Thursday, Jan. 16, 2025, in Washington.(Associated Press)\n\"There are many factors to why housing is so expensive now, and I believe first we need to get our own fiscal house in order,\" Turner told Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., when she asked Turner if he would support additional federal investment to lower the cost to build more affordable housing. \"I do look forward to looking at the HOME Program and other programs, but there's record funding from HUD. HUD's budget is nearly $70 billion at this point, and we're still not meeting the need that we're supposed to be meeting.\"\nDemocrats at the hearing suggested they were concerned that Turner would slash federal funding for certain programs, such as HUD\u2019s Section 8 housing program and the agency's flagship HOME Investment Partnership Program. When probed about his approach to funding certain programs, Turner told Democrats he would work with them to review their concerns on a case-by-case basis but did not confirm one way or the other whether he would slash funding.\n\"The federal financing is a key part of financing housing, and affordable housing in Nevada,\" Sen. Catherine Cortez, D-Nev., said Thursday.\n\"We need to make some big changes,\" Warren added. \"To really move the needle, the federal government needs to be a good partner, investing in affordable housing and spurring local innovation to cut red tape.\"\nAt one point during the hearing, Turner was asked about his support for work requirements for those receiving Section 8 housing assistance, telling committee members he thought it was a good idea.

{"title":"As a Berkeley professor, I see the impact H-1B visas and AI have on students' job opportunities","date":1736380800000,"body":"American Majority founder and CEO Ned Ryun joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss Republicans divided over H-1B visas and Vivek Ramaswamy's comments calling out U.S. culture of 'mediocrity'.\nTheH-1B visa programwas intended to bring in specialized talent from abroad, but instead it has become a tool for employers to hire lower-cost labor for ordinary jobs.\nThe result is a distorted job market, where highly skilled workers are being squeezed out of the H-1B visa program by spam applications for ordinary workers who then take entry-level positions that are already in short supply. This misuse of H-1B visas has a negative synergy with growingimpact of AI on the job marketand is part of a larger problem that urgently needs attention.\nThe impact of this visa-farming problem is particularly acute among young people and recent college graduates, who face a bleak job market despite moderate overall unemployment rates. According to government data, the ratio of unemployment for college grads under 25 to those over 25 has hit an all-time high of more than four to one. This means that entry-level jobs are already four times more scarce than jobs requiring experience or advanced expertise.\nProgram applicants explicitly should be people with specialized skills, and those specialized skills should not be readily available fromexisting resident workers.\nI have seen firsthand the symptoms of decreasing demand forentry-level tech jobs. These symptoms include fewer job notices from recruiters targeting fresh CS grads, job fairs with fewer companies, and concerned advisees getting fewer offers with lower pay or in some cases not getting any offers at all. Awarding the H-1B visas to low-paid, non-specialist workers only exacerbates this scarcity while doing little to fill the actual demand for workers with specialist skills.\nH-1B VISAS HURT ONE TYPE OF WORKER AND EXPLOIT ANOTHER. THIS MESS MUST BE FIXED\nThe problem here is not about the number of visas issued, but rather how they're being used. Program applicants explicitly should be people with specialized skills, and those specialized skills should not be readily available fromexisting resident workers. However, the bureaucratic review process allows employers to exaggerate claims and hire workers with ordinary skills at low wages. There is an entire sub-profession of HR staff and attorneys that specialize in dressing up pigeons to look like peacocks.\nThis abuse of the application process has created a lottery system where workers with the needed special skills often lose out to those who don't have any specialized skills. As a result, recent graduates are finding it harder to get entry-level work, while at the same time companies that really need specific specialized skills can't get visas for those workers. Imagine a person who is suffering from both malnutrition and diabetes because instead of vitamins, they have been gobbling sugar pills.\nI want to emphasize that I'm not advocating for insular restrictions on thenumber of H-1B visas. The issue is about ensuring that people with real specialized skills that are actually needed are being welcomed through the H-1B program. When used properly, an H-1B visa brings in someone who supplements the workforce with skills that are both needed and specialized, potentially benefiting the whole country. Whether it\u2019s retaining a graduating international student or bringing in someone from outside the country, the U.S. has historically benefited immensely from immigrants with needed skills.\nMany people who are invested in visa farming insist unconvincingly that the H-1B visas are already going to specialized workers as intended, but the statistics on H-1B visa recipients don't agree.\nTRUMP SAYS HE'S NOT CHANGED HIS MIND ON H-1B VISAS AS DEBATE RAGES WITHIN MAGA COALITION\nAccording to the annual report from the U.S. government's Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services, nearly 63,000 of the 2023 H-1B visa recipients were in \"Computer-Related Occupations\" and the median salary for this group was $99,000 per year with 25% of them earning less than $85,000. A salary of $99,000 or $85,000 per year is certainly a good amount to be earning, but it is quite low for what I would expect someone with rare specialized skills in this field to be earning.\nOne would think that people with specialized, hard-to-find skills would earn exceptionally good salaries, but instead these data show the opposite. In fact, the more I dig into the data in the agency's annual report, the less it appears that approved applications are for exceptional people for specialized jobs. It looks more like somespecially skilled workersmixed in with a lot of regular workers who are being paid on the low end of what I'd expect.\nThese observations are consistent with my own experiences in hiring tech workers and advising CS students, what has been related to me first hand by others, and numerous recently published analyses. The only clear explanation I see for these inconsistencies is that employers are submitting entry-level positions, not ones requiring special rare skills, that even for entry-level the salaries are low, and that those non-conforming applications are not being rejected.\nLooking at the bigger picture, misuse of H-1B visas is not the only obstacle that U.S. job seekers face because AI automation is also eliminating jobs, compounding scarcity. Currently, the impact of AI is disproportionately on entry-level jobs, which exacerbates the problems caused by abuse of the H-1B program. However, AI will continue to improve, both in capability and ease of use, and its impact on the job market will grow as the range of tasks that can be done by AI expands.\nMAGA\u2019S H-1B \u2018CIVIL WAR\u2019 IS EXACTLY HOW POLITICS IS SUPPOSED TO WORK\nWhile AI and H-1B visa abuse may appear to be distinct problems, they interact in a way that most people don't appreciate. Even when it can't totally replace a human worker,AI facilitates moving workaway from regular employees to contractors or remote workers.\nThe explanation is that AI often removes the need for an advanced specialized skill or knowledge, and replaces it with a lesser requirement of only needing the ability to review work for correctness. The result is that tasks which previously were too complex for moving to contractors or remote workers now become simpler due to AI and more suitable for externalizing.\nAs AI technology continues to improve employers will find that more and more jobs can be done by less-skilled workers, and there will be increased motivation to use H-1B visas for hiring those less-skilled workers cheaply.\nThe review process for the H-1B visa program needs to be reformed to prioritize applicants with real specialized talents and to ensure that recipients don't unfairly compete with workers already in the U.S. We must also address the growing threat of AI automation and its growing impact on the job market.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nRoughly 90% all ofU.S. tax revenuecomes from taxing the income of working individuals, so if unemployment continues to expand then tax revenue will dramatically shrink. At the same time, the number of unemployed people needing public assistance needs will skyrocket. That combination doesn't work mathematically and is a clear recipe for disaster.\nThis situation demands radical change to avoid a dystopian future. Overall unemployment numbers may appear robust, but high levels of entry-level unemployment and overall underemployment indicate that a much bigger problem is developing.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDisclaimer: Any opinions expressed in this article are only those of the author as a private individual.

The rule is now in its final stages before it will be formally published in the Federal Register.\n\"The Bureau of Industry and Security\u2019s ('BIS') proposed Interim Final Rule ('IFR') is a highly complex and wildly overbroad attempt to regulate Artificial Intelligence and GPUs in the name of national security,\" Ken Glueck, the executive vice president atOracle, wrote in a blog post Sunday that was published to his company's website.\n\"For over half a century, bipartisan consensus has held that the best way to achieve U.S. technological leadership is to regulate technologywith a light touch.

The group encouraged the Biden administration to \"hand over the policymaking process\" to theincoming Trump administrationbecause it will \"ensure there is appropriate opportunity for government and industry leaders, together with our global partners, to thoughtfully address this critical matter.\"\nEXPERTS PRAISE LONG-AWAITED AI REPORT FROM CONGRESS: \u2018A THOUGHTFUL AND FORWARD THINKING FRAMEWORK\u2019\nIt is uncertain exactly how the incoming administration might approach this issue.

{"title":"SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: H-1B visas hurt one type of worker and exploit another. This mess must be fixed","date":1736294400000,"body":"'Fox & Friends' co-hosts weigh in on the debate over H-1B visas, which allow U.S. companies to hire foreign workers for specialty jobs, after Elon Musk and President-elect Trump expressed support for the program.\nWe are living in a moment with unprecedented income and wealth inequality.\u00a0 At a time when the richest people in our country have never had it so good, 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and inflation-adjusted income for the average American worker has been stagnant for 50 years. Why is that?\nHow did it happen that the three richest men in America own more wealth than the bottom half of our society while so many of our people struggle to afford thehigh cost of rent, groceries and other basic necessities of life?\nIt's time to take a hard look at some of the economic policies which have made the rich much richer while many Americans continue to fall further and further behind.\nBERNIE SANDERS HITS OUT AT H-1B VISA PROGRAM FOR REPLACING AMERICAN JOBS WITH 'INDENTURED SERVANTS'\nThirty years ago, the leaders of corporate America, the political establishment in both major parties and the editorial boards of influential newspapers told us not to worry about the loss of blue-collar manufacturing jobs that would come as a result of unfetteredfree trade agreementslike NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China (PNTR). They promised that those lost jobs would be more than offset by the many good-paying, white-collar information technology jobs that would be created in the United States.\u00a0 I never believed that and voted against those agreements.\nUnfortunately, I, and the many others who opposed those trade deals, were proven correct. NAFTA and PNTR cost us millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs as large corporations shut down thousands of factories in America and fled to China, Mexico, and other low-wage countries in search of cheap labor.\nAnd what about all of the great high-tech jobs that would be created?\u00a0 Well, that didn't quite happen either.\u00a0 As a result of the H-1B guest worker program, major corporations are now importing hundreds of thousands of low-paid guest workers from abroad to fill thewhite-collar technology jobsthat are available.\u00a0 In other words, \"Heads billionaires win. Tails American workers lose.\"\nIn recent weeks, the H-1B program has sparked intense debate. Billionaires likeElon Muskclaim it is crucial to our economy, arguing that the United States faces a shortage of highly skilled engineers and technology professionals.\u00a0They are dead wrong.\nThe primary purpose of H-1B and other guest worker programs is not to employ the \"best and the brightest,\" but instead to replace American workers with lower-paid workers from abroad who often live as indentured servants.\u00a0 The cheaper it is to hire guest workers, the more money the multi-billionaire owners of large corporations make.\nSEN BERNIE SANDERS: TWO AMERICAS, THE PEOPLE VS. THE BILLIONAIRES\nNot only is this program disastrous for American workers, it can be very harmful to guest workers as well, who are often locked into lower-paying jobs and can have their visas taken away from them by their corporate bosses if they complain about dangerous, unfair or illegal working conditions.\nBetween 2022 and 2023, the top companies using the H-1B program laid off 85,000 American workers, while simultaneously bringing in over 34,000 guest workers from abroad. Meanwhile, millions of Americans with advanced degrees in STEM fields are unable to find work in their areas of expertise.\nIf there is truly a major shortage of skilled tech workers in this country,\u00a0why did Tesla lay-off over 7,500 American workers last year \u2013 including many software developers and engineers at its factory inAustin, Texas\u2013 while applying to hire thousands of H-1B guest workers?\nIf these jobs are only going to \"the best and brightest,\" why has Tesla employed H-1B guest workers asassociate accountantsfor as little as $58,000,associate mechanical engineersfor as little as $70,000 a year, andassociate material plannersfor as little as $80,000 a year? Those don\u2019t sound like highly specialized jobs that are for the top 0.1 percent, as Musk claimed last month. Musk has failed to address concerns about Tesla's use of H-1B visas for its employees.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIf this program is really supposed to be about importing workers with highly advanced degrees in science and technology, why are H-1B guest workers being employed aslawyers,dog trainers,massage therapists,cooks, andEnglish teachers? Can we really not find English teachers in America?\u00a0 Do we really believe that we are facing a dire shortage of lawyers in our country?\nLet\u2019s be clear.\u00a0To the extent that there may\u00a0be labor shortages in our country in some highly specialized areas that need to be filled by employees from abroad through the H-1B program,\u00a0we need to make sure that this program is used as a short-term fix.\nLong-term, if the United States is going to succeed in ahighly competitive global economy, we must have the best-educated workforce in the world.\nAnd one way to help make that happen is to substantially increase the guest worker fees large corporations pay to fund scholarships, apprenticeships, and job training opportunities for American workers. This is something that I have advocated from my first days as a U.S. senator.\nFurther, we must also significantly raise the minimum wage for guest workers, give them the freedom to easily switch jobs and require corporations to aggressively recruit American workers first before they can hire workers from overseas. The widespread corporate abuse of the H-1B program must be ended.\nMulti-billionaire oligarchs in Big Tech should not be allowed to hire guest workers to fill entry-level and mid-level Information Technology jobs.\u00a0 Those jobs should be going to American workers who have theConstitutional rightto form a union and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions.\nIt must never be cheaper for a corporation to hire a guest worker from overseas than an American worker.\nMr. Musk, Mr. Ramaswamy, and others have argued that we need a highly skilled and well-educated workforce. They are right. But the answer, however, is not to bring in cheap labor from abroad.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe answer is to hire qualified American workers first and to make certain that we have an education system that produces the kind of workforce that our country needs for the jobs of the future. And that\u2019s not just engineering. We are in desperate need of more doctors, nurses, dentists, teachers, electricians, plumbers, and a host of other professions.\nBottom line: We need an economy that works for all, not just the few.

{"title":"3 ways Trump can deliver an economic 'golden age' for America","date":1735862400000,"body":"'Outnumbered' panelists discuss the possible executive orders President-elect Trump plans to issue on the first day of his second term.\nAs he prepares to take office, President-elect Donald Trump has outlined an audacious goal of returning to pre-pandemic rates of economic growth and a \"golden age of America.\" After four years of being told the economy was better than how it hit our wallets, this is a welcome change of direction.\nTo achieve this objective, the new administration is going to need the private sector \u2013 something the Biden era not only mostly ignored, but whose regulatory agenda was downright hostile to the concerns of most industries. The franchise sector, which I represent and includes 800,000 small businesses supporting 9 million workers, is ready to get to work as a resource to the Trump administration.\nFranchising played a starring role in the 2024 election, no more so than Trump\u2019s turn behind the fryer of a Pennsylvania McDonald\u2019s. While franchising is often associated with food, most (more than six in ten) are in another industry, ranging from hotels, salons, fitness, pet care and many more.\nEXPERT SOUNDS ALARM ON A \u2018DEFINITE SHIFT\u2019 HAPPENING IN CORPORATE AMERICA\nEven after several punitive attacks on franchising from the Biden administration, the franchise sector is projected to have grown by 4% this year compared to 2.7% for the broader economy.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump works the drive-through line during a campaign photo op as he visits a McDonald's restaurant in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania on October 20, 2024. Even that brief stint in fast food is a strong reminder of the importance of franchisesto the US economy.(Win McNamee\/Getty Images)\nWith a change in philosophy at the federal government, the opportunities for franchising\u2019s animal spirits to be harnessed are ripe. Here are three things the Trump administration can do to supercharge its economic growth:\nThere is no bigger federal priority for franchising thanclarifying the joint employer standard.The entire model hinges on the independence between the franchisor (the brand) and its individual franchisees. The former provides the concept, the framework and the branding for the latter, who is free to run their own business, in exchange for an agreed-upon fee and following the brand standards that consumers expect, whether in Palm Beach or Parsippany.\nIn 2023, the Biden administration\u2019s National Labor Relations Board tried to reverse the 2020Trump joint employer standardand remove the autonomy between franchisors and franchisees. As the name suggests, the goal was putting the franchisor on the hook for franchisee\u2019s employees to increase legal liability and ease of unionization.\nThankfully, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas threw out the Biden overreach, but after four changes to this rule in the last decade, franchising needs a permanent standard for joint employment that codifies the Trump definition. Business owners can\u2019t plan when the regulatory climate is always changing with the occupant of the White House. They need certainty.\nIn 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), known colloquially asthe Trump tax cuts.Contrary to opponents\u2019 suggestions about \"tax cuts for the rich,\" these policies became lifelines for small business owners, helping take the economy to new highs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet without action, they are all set to expire at the end of 2025.\nOne especially important component of the Trump tax cuts is Section 199A, which allows for a 20% deduction of qualified income for pass-through businesses. Since most franchise businesses are structured as a pass-through entity, 199A levels the playing field between small businesses and large corporations, who already enjoy a bevy of tax cuts.\nTo head off any last-minute \"fiscal cliffs\" like the recent showdown over government funding, the re-authorization of the tax cuts should be prioritized early in the new year. Not only would the action allow small business owners much-needed certainty, but it would also send a clear message that the days of putting off important action until the last moment are over.\nPrior to Biden appointing Lina Khan to lead the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2021, most Americans had never heard of the agency, and for good reason. Established a century ago to ensure a competitive business environment and protect consumers, the FTC under Khan morphed into a hyper-aggressive agency stepping outside the lanes of its authority.\nFederal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan has been much criticized by the business community for her aggressive approach. FILE: Khan testifies before the House Judiciary Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill on July 13, 2023, in Washington, DC.(Chip Somodevilla\/Getty Images)\nInstead of standing up for consumers, Khan antagonized the business community. She launchedcountless lawsuitsand investigations, forcing industry to spend precious time and resources fending off government regulators rather than growing their businesses.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIn 2023, Khan launched a sweeping Request For Information into franchising designed to elicit negative comments, and then extended its time period in the summer of 2024, when she didn\u2019t get the desired results.\nTrump named Andrew Ferguson as his replacement for Khan, and not a moment too soon. Already, there are promising signs that the tide is turning. The highly anticipated \"junk fee\" rule announced by the FTC was more narrowly tailored than its original iteration.\nBusiness owners can\u2019t plan when the regulatory climate is always changing with the occupant of the White House. They need certainty.\nAchieving the \"golden age of America\" won\u2019t be easy, but that should not deter us.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAmerica didn\u2019t become the envy of the world by settling for less. We didn\u2019t heed President John F. Kennedy\u2019s call of walking on the moon in the 1960s or President Ronald Reagan\u2019s mission to \"tear down this wall\" in the 1980s by going small.\nReaching that 4% economic growth number will require everyone rowing in the same direction.
