{"title":"Sales prices for sports teams are soaring to record levels. Here\u2019s why, and what that means for fans","date":"2025-06-21","body":"The Los Angeles Lakers may not have as many NBA titles as the Boston Celtics, but the Lakers topped their archrival with a record-setting $10 billion franchise price tag this week \u2014 just three months after the Celtics held the honor for thehighest salepricefor a professional sports team at $6 billion.\nBut thisrecordmight not last very long. The NFL\u2019s New York Giants are in the process of shopping a 10% ownership stake, which could put the team\u2019s overall value above $10 billion, according to Marc Ganis, a Chicago-based sports consultant who advises NFL, NBA and MLB clubs.\nWhat\u2019s clear is that the valuations of sports teams are continuing to climb \u2014 and climb rapidly.\nVictor Matheson, aprofessor of economics at College of the Holy Cross who specializes in sports business, said in his 30 years of studying sports sales, he can\u2019t remember a team selling for less than it was purchased. For example, a 10% stake in the Milwaukee Bucks was sold in September 2024, which valued the small-market NBA team at $4 billion, a windfall from when the team was sold a decade earlier for $550 million.\nSo even if the $10 billion record for the Lakers stands a while longer, other teams will eventuallybe sold at a hefty premium to their previous purchase price.\nThe impact on fans, meanwhile, can be complicated. Fans often publicly yearn for an owner who is willing to spend what it takes to make the team competitive, yet some of the wealthiest owners have lousy records. In the end, fans are more likely to care about a team\u2019s winning percentage than its owner\u2019s net worth.\nSports franchises have long been considered trophy assets,like luxury properties in short supply.\n\u201cThe only thing I remember from all those economics courses is when the supply is fixed, and the demand goes up, prices go up. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said Sal Galatioto, one of the leading sports investment bankers brokering team sales. \u201cIt is so rare you get a chance to buy control of a premier franchise.\u201d\nSports franchises have grownin value over the last decade. Cord-cutting, streaming and DVRs have made it more difficult for advertisers to reach viewers, meaning live sports programming has become more important.\nMajor sporting events have reliably been among the most-watched events on television.\n\u201cSports content is the lifeblood of the media industry and that drives tremendous value for these franchises,\u201d said Lori Bistis, a deals partner and one of the leaders of accounting and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 sports practice.\nWhile cord-cutting has resulted in some regional sports networks falling on to financial hard times in recent years,streaming services\ufeffhave shownincreasing interest in broadcasting games.\nBistis said it only makes sense to see sports franchise values rise in tandem with that of lucrative television rights deals.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised to see the increase in valuation and all the data points to it continuing,\u201d she said.\nAnother factor: Buyers of professional sports teams know they will have access to valuable data on the demographics and spending behavior of their fans. Bistis said data can be monetizedthrough different viewing experiences, merchandise and events.\nGalatioto said the increase in sports gaming since it becamelegal in 2018is alsodriving up the interest in sports and sports programming.\nDeep-pocket investors have lined up to buy even minority stakes in teams and that is helping to drive up the valuations, as well.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of new money coming into the business,\u201d said Galatioto. \u201cI can always find the high net-worth individuals willing to pay more. An individual gets ego gratification value, gets perks, they get other advantages.\u201d\nA potential buyer could think,\u201cI\u2019m willing to pay a premium to be an owner of my favorite team. I\u2019m not willing to pay a premium to be an owner of a bunch of assets,\u201d according to Galatioto.\nAnd a greater supply of potential buyers interested in minority stakes in teams can help drive up the prices being paid even more, said sports consultant Ganis.\n\u201cThe universe of potential buyers of a 5% or 10% stake is much larger than the universe of potential buyers who can buy a 100% stake,\u201d he said.\nBillionaire businessman Mark Walter, who is now buying a controlling stake in the Lakers with this deal, had been one of those minority ownerswith a significant stake in a team, Ganis noted.\nWalter had a nearly 27% stake, so his purchase of about a quarter of the team is all he needed to cross the 50% threshold.Hedidn\u2019t have to put up a full $10 billion in his bid for the Lakers \u2014 just a fraction of that amount, according to Ganis.\nWalter, the CEO of global investment and advisory firm Guggenheim Partners, also leads Guggenheim Baseball Management, which owns a controlling stake in the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers.\nGuggenheim Baseball Management has invested heavily in the Dodgers\u2019 success. The Dodgers, who have the highest team payroll ($338 million) in baseball, are followed by the New York Mets, at $325 million, according to salary tracker Spotrac. The Mets, who were bought by Wall Street financierSteve Cohen in 2020and had the highest payroll in 2024, fell to the Dodgers in last year\u2019s postseason.\nBut spending big on players, coaches and a front office doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to winning titles.\nOnly twice in the last 15 years has the baseball team with the top payroll won the World Series: the Boston Red Sox in 2018 and the Dodgers in 2020. (Major League Baseball is the only American sports league without a salary cap.)\nThere have been champions during that time, such as the Kansas City Royals, whose team payroll in 2015was just a fraction of the league\u2019s top payrolls.\nThe deep pockets of the new class of owners have less of an influence on a team\u2019s success in leagues with salary caps, such as the National Football League and National Hockey League.\nSo while baseball fans may get frustrated when their owners are not willing to spend to improve the team\u2019s roster, having an ownership of more modest means doesn\u2019t necessarily prevent a team from coming out on top.\nMatheson said he\u2019s studied the relationship between winning and payroll in baseball and found that higher payrolls do help teams win, at least during the regular season, but payrolls are only responsible for predicting about 30% of a team\u2019s success. The other 70% is due to factors like good management, avoiding injuries and even luck.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a fan, you\u2019re always wanted an owner who spends more money, but just because you have got an owner who does spend more money, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re winning the whole thing,\u201d he said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/21\/business\/sports-team-sales-prices-soar","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Major milestone: US gas prices drop below $3 a gallon for first time since May 2021","date":"2025-12-02","body":"The last time gasoline was this cheap,4% inflationseemed alarming, JD Vance wasstill a private citizenand the United States had only just begun its messywithdrawal from Afghanistan.\nGas prices dropped below an average of $3 a gallon in the United States on Tuesday for the first time in four-and-a-half years, according to AAA.\nThe milestone represents a rare feel-good story in a years-long affordability crisis marked by high prices for necessities.\nThe national average forregular gas dipped to $2.998 a gallon, compared with $3.001 on Monday. Pump prices are down about six cents in just the past week and are below $3 for the first time since May 2021.\nGas is also cheaper than it was last year, albeit modestly. The national average a year ago was $3.05 a gallon. Last month, gas prices werebriefly more expensiveon a year-over-year basis.\nPrices are even lower in many parts of the country.\nAccording to AAA, the average price for gas is below $2.75 a gallon in 18 states, including New Mexico, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Iowa and Colorado.\nIt\u2019s a far cry from 2022 when Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices skyrocketing. At one point, gas prices surged beyond $5 a gallon for the first time ever, prompting the Biden administration to release emergency oil stockpiles.\nPresident Donald Trump has made lower energy prices a central focus of his second term, vowing to keep a lid on prices at the pump by embracing a \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d agenda of deregulation and support for fossil fuels.\nDays into his second term, Trump also used a high-profile speech at Davos to call for Saudi Arabia-led OPEC to ramp up production.\nAlthough Trump\u2019s promises to slash grocery prices have not borne out and electric bills have increased sharply, gas is a bit cheaper than it was at this point last year. The biggest reason: Oil is much cheaper than it was at this point in prior years.\nIn early December 2022, months after Russia invaded Ukraine, US oil prices were sitting at about $81 a barrel. At this point last year, crude traded at around $70 a barrel. Today a barrel of crude is selling for just $59.\nOil has been driven lower by the fact that supply continues to outpace demand.\nUS oil production continues to break record highs, although it is only slightly higher than a year ago.\nThe bigger driver is the fact that OPEC has ramped up production this year, something the producer group refused to do in years past.\nAs always, oil prices can quickly change course, especially if investors fear a geopolitical conflict will threaten supplies. Trump in recent days has threatened to attack Venezuela, which hasmore oil reservesthan any nation on the planet.\nBut some on Wall Street are betting oil prices could stay cheap for some time, keeping gas prices low.\nIf OPEC doesn\u2019t intervene to ease the supply glut, Brent crude oil \u2013 the international benchmark \u2013 will likely drop into the low $50s per barrel by the fourth quarter of next year and close 2026 in the $40s, JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote in a recent report.\nJPMorgan said the \u201coutlook worsens\u201d in 2027, with a mounting surplus driving Brent to an average of just $42 a barrel and sinking into the $30s by the end of that year.\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/02\/business\/gas-prices-three-dollars","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Sorry, America. Coffee prices probably aren\u2019t coming down","date":"2025-11-13","body":"A version of this story appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nWith renewed verve for the word\u201caffordability\u201dafter the GOP got absolutely trounced in last week\u2019s off-year elections, the Trump administration is scrambling to show it\u2019s doing something, anything, to bring prices down.\nOne solution on offer: reversing its own policy of taxing coffee imports.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see some substantial announcements over the next couple of days in terms of things we don\u2019t grow here in the United States \u2014 coffee being one of them, bananas, other fruits, things like that,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News on Wednesday. \u201cSo that that will bring the prices down very quickly.\u201d\n*record scratch*\nThis is interesting for a couple of reasons:\nTo state the obvious: Coffee has becomeannoyingly expensive. Retail prices are up about 20% year-over-year.\nThere are two primary causes for that price inflation: Extremely volatile weather has eaten into the harvest of an already labor-intensive, hard-to-grow crop. That\u2019s been happening for a few years. And Trump\u2019s tariffs on Brazil (50%), Colombia (10%) and Vietnam (20%)\u2014 the three biggest coffee exporters \u2014 are piling added costs on top of that. And since coffee only grows in a few places on Earth, it\u2019s not like we can just mow down a few cornfields out in the heartland and start up our own domestic supply.\nCoffee prices haven\u2019t surged this much in decades\nThrough it all, Americans haven\u2019t abandoned their stimulant of choice.\nConsumption has held steady through price increases, according to the National Coffee Association, because coffee feels like both an essential and a worthwhile indulgence. There may be no other consumer product that Americans are more devoted to across income levels, political leanings, geography, age, race, gender, you name it.\nAnd businesses know that. Coffee sellers have raised prices to stay in business, and we\u2019re still buying. So why not keep charging us $7 a pop if they can?\nWhy the blue wave? It is, of course, the economy, stupid\nThat\u2019s exactly what we should expect, especially when it comes to buying coffee at a cafe, according to Alex Susskind, professor of wine education and management at Cornell.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a principle that applies to most businesses, that once you take price increases, you tend not to give them back,\u201d he told CNN.\nBig chains like Starbucks or Peet\u2019s, he said, are likely to hold strong on prices even if the tariffs go away because their core customers haven\u2019t been deterred by higher prices.\nBut some price relief could come to the grocery store, among mass-market coffee producers whose customers are more sensitive to price movements.\nBottom line:More than nine months into his second term, Trump is losing the affordability argument \u2014 the issue that, by his own telling, won him re-election.A CNN poll last weekfound that 61% of Americans say his policies \u201cworsened economic conditions in this country.\u201d That number topped out at 58% under Biden in CNN polling, and it was generally in the low-to-mid-50s during Biden\u2019s term.\nIf Trump lowers coffee tariffs thinking he\u2019s going to get Americans relief, he picked the wrong product. We the people may not like paying more for coffee, but we do it anyway. And ultimately, the extra dollars and cents we\u2019re spending on coffee pale in comparison to thebig-ticket issues\u2014 namely housing, energy and health care \u2014 that helped secure Democrats\u2019 wins last week.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/13\/business\/coffee-prices-not-coming-down","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

US gold futures settled down 5.7% at $4,087.70, marking the steepest percentage decline since April 2013. Silver and platinum also slumped sharply on Tuesday, down 7% and 5% respectively.\nAnalysts said the sell-off followed weeks of heavy buying that had pushed gold to overheated levels.\nGold has seen historic gains in 2025, its more-than-50% surge surpassing previous volatile periods such as after the September 11 attacks, the 2008 financial crisis or even the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWhy is the price of gold surging?\nIn the past two months alone, gold prices have rallied 25%, driven by demand amid rising US government debt, political uncertainty, and speculation about further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\nBut optimism over easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, as well as a rebound in the US dollar, prompted investors to lock in profits.

{"title":"Good news! Prices are falling. But it might be for bad reasons","date":"2025-05-14","body":"The lowest inflation rate infour-yearswas made possible by a trend that will surely bring smiles to the faces of Americans: Falling prices.\nEgg prices plungedbetween March and April by the most since 1984, according to theBureau of Labor Statistics. Used cars and trucks unexpectedly got cheaper despite auto tariffs. So did clothes.\nThose price drops are encouraging and should help families who are hurting from the high cost of living.\nBut not all price drops are created equal. Some of the good inflation news might be happening for a bad reason: a weakening economy.\nIn Tuesday\u2019s report, some price drops hint at softer demand from consumers facing an onslaught of policy changes out of Washington, a confusing trade war and turbulence in financial markets.\nFor example, airfare fell 2.8% in April, marking the third-straight monthly decline. Prices for hotels, motels and other lodging away from home dipped too. Ticket prices for sporting events plunged by 12.2%, the biggest monthly decline on record.\n\u201cThose are tell-tale signs of consumer stress. This is the never-ending daily chaos exacting a cost on the economy,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\nSamuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note Tuesday that high uncertainty andanemic consumer confidenceare causing \u201cweak demand\u201d for some discretionary services.\nTombs noted, for instance, that Google searches for phrases including \u201cflights\u201d were very low in April.\nFaced with fragile demand, some companies have been forced to lower their prices to lure customers. And that in turn has helped to lower the annual inflation rate to 2.3% in April, the lowest annual rate since February 2021.\nThe declines in airfare and hotel pricing \u201cmay be indicative of weakening demand for discretionary services,\u201d Bank of America economists wrote in a note on Tuesday. \u201cThat bears watching in the high frequency data\u2026as it could be evidence that sentiment is weighing on consumption.\u201d\nConsumer confidence has plunged this year amid widespread concerns about tariffs and turmoil in financial markets. However, that drop in sentiment has not translated to a significant pullback on consumer spending, the main driver of the US economy.\nOthers argue it\u2019s far too early to conclude that consumer demand really is faltering.\nThe timing of Easter may have \u201cmucked\u201d with prices for air travel, hotels and elsewhere, noted Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. He said the drop in prices for sports \u201ccould be more noise than signal.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think consumers are running for the bunker,\u201d Sweet told CNN in an email. \u201cIf consumers were hunkering down, they would cut back on dining out and going to the movies.\u201d\nAlthoughAMC Theatres is offering 50% off ticketson Wednesdays this summer, restaurants are hardly empty.\nIn fact, the number of seated diners in the United States from online reservations was 10% higher in April year-over-year, according toOpenTable data. Seated diners so far in May are up 8%.\nAnd restaurants don\u2019t appear to be slashing prices to attract diners.\nThe BLS found that food prices for full-service meals and snacks increased by 0.6% between March and April, outpacing broader inflation.\nOne obvious example of soft demand is airfare.\nSome major airlines have recently cut their financial guidance due to concerns about the health of the US economy.\nDelta Air Lines warnedon April 9 that \u201cgrowth has largely stalled\u201d due to \u201cbroad economic uncertainty around global trade.\u201d (President Donald Trump would walk back some of his most aggressive \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs later that day, sending US markets skyrocketing).\nAmerican Airlinestold CNBClast month that domestic leisure travel \u201cfell off considerably\u201d starting in February.\nOf course, cheaper airfare is not solely about weaker travel demand from US consumers.\nAnother factor: Foreign travel into the United States has cooled.\nForeign visitors to the United States by air are down 2.5% through the end of April, according to the Commerce Department\u2019sInternational Trade Administration. United Airlines reported steady declines in international passengers originating in Europe and Canada.\nGoldman Sachs said the drop in airfare, and hotel prices, may reflect \u201csofter demand for business and government travel and from foreign tourism.\u201d\nAirlines have also been able to cut airfare because fuel has gotten cheaper as a result of the drop in oil prices.\nFalling oil prices also helped push down the inflation rate by lowering prices at the gas pump.\nUS crudeoil prices plungedlast week to a four-year low of $57.13 a barrel, though they have since bounced back to around $64.\nThe drop in oil prices has been driven by both \u201cgood\u201d factors \u2013 namely, more supply from OPEC and near-record output from US producers \u2013 and by \u201cbad\u201d reasons like concerns about the health of the world economy and the fallout from the trade war.\nNo matter the cause, many economists worry the subdued inflation readings won\u2019t last because of the trade war.\nMarco Casiraghi, senior economist and strategist at Evercore ISI, told CNN the impact on prices from historically-high tariffs will strengthen in the coming months.\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s coming,\u201d Casiraghi said. \u201cThis looks like the calm before storm.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/14\/business\/inflation-trump-airfare-prices","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"$2,000 for a phone? Apple says yes","date":"2025-09-19","body":"Back in 2017, consumers balked at the idea of a$1,000 iPhone. Now, some shoppers may end up paying double thatif they choose Apple\u2019s latest top-of-the-line model.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max, the larger variant of Apple\u2019s Pro phone that launches today along with the iPhone 17, 17 Pro andiPhone Air,costs $2,000 if buyers choose the version with two terabytes (2TB) of storage. Phones with extra storage typically cost more, but this is the first time Apple has released a 2TB option for the iPhone, making it one of the most expensive phones on the market.\nThe launch comes as Apple faces mounting pressure to boost iPhone sales amid concerns about itsAI strategy. Offering a more expensive price tier for the iPhone allows Apple to generate more revenue without selling more units during what has been, until recently, a rocky smartphone market.Someanalysts sayconsumers, tightening their purse strings because of inflation and tariffs, have been cutting back spending on smartphones.\nApple\u2019s new iPhones should modestly raise the product\u2019s average selling price, or the average price iPhones are sold at, said Angelo Zino, senior vice president at investment research firm CFRA. That\u2019s a metric analysts monitor as a sign of how lucrative the iPhone is for Apple.\nBut Zino largely expects the price boost to be driven by demand for the iPhone Air, which is $100 more expensive than last year\u2019s iPhone 16 Plus. The 2TB storage option is a means for Apple to differentiate its high-end phones from the competition, he says. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra and Google\u2019s Pixel 10 Pro XL top out at 1TB of storage.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting kind of offering, in the sense that I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s another phone out there that offers a two terabyte internal storage,\u201d he said.\nThe $2,000 iPhone may be Apple\u2019s most expensive phone yet, but it\u2019s not quite as pricey as foldable phones fromSamsungand Google with 1TB of storage. The 1TB version of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 7 costs$2,419.99, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold with the same amount of storage is priced at$2,149.\nMany buyers aren\u2019t likely to immediately face that price tag since carriers typically offer trade-in deals and payment plans to soften the blow. Fifty-five percent of phone shoppers in the United States \u2014 including those who purchase flip phones and basic mobile phones \u2014 buy their device through an installment plan, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.\nAnd it\u2019s shoppers looking for less expensive phones, not premium devices like the iPhone 17 Pro Max, that are more likely to hold off on upgrading.\n\u201cEconomic uncertainty tends to compress demand at the lower end of the market, where price sensitivity is highest,\u201d the International Data Corporation\u2019s Nabila Popal wrote in a report earlier this month.\nApple\u2019s Pro iPhones tend to sell better than the standard entry-level models, particularly in the United States, according to CFRA\u2019s Zino and Josh Lowitz, an analyst for Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.\nThe increased storage may also be another sign that Apple is marketing its \u201cpro\u201d iPhones towards content creators and video editors. Large multimedia files typically take up more space, and the Pro models also include support for tools used to sync video across multiple cameras. Apple said it filmed its September launch event on an iPhone 17 Pro.\nLowitz noted that 2TB is considered a lot of storage even for a laptop. Those who purchase 2TB laptops typically work in fields that require saving a lot of large files locally, like graphic designers who need to preserve hundreds of different design versions for projects.\n\u201cOther than people with extraordinary video usage, two terabytes is just \u2026 it\u2019s a crazy amount of storage,\u201d he said.\nApple announced itsnew iPhone lineup on September 9on its campus in Cupertino, California, ahead of the Friday launch. The Pro models include a redesigned back panel and a camera with a longer zoom, along with extended battery life. The iPhones also have better performance dueto Apple\u2019s new chip and an updated design that allows for better heat dissipation, Apple claims.\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives predicts iPhone preorders will increase five to 10% compared to last year since the firm estimates 20% of global iPhone owners haven\u2019t upgraded in the past four years.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/19\/tech\/apple-iphone-17-pro-max-2tb-2000-dollars","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump admin says drug price negotiations will save Medicare roughly $12 billion","date":"2025-11-25","body":"Medicare will save approximately $12 billion, or 44%, on 15 high-cost medications as a result of the second round of the program\u2019s drug price negotiations, the Trump administration announced Tuesday evening. The savings are estimated based on what Medicare spent on the medicines last year.\nMedicare enrollees are expected to save $685 million on out-of-pocket costs when the prices take effect in 2027.\nOzempic and Wegovy, the blockbuster but costly GLP-1 drugs often used for weight loss and diabetes treatment, are among the medications that wereselected for the second roundby the Biden administration just days before it left office. The negotiated price for 2027 ranges from $277 for Ozempic to $386 for Wegovy.\nHowever, manufacturer Novo Nordisk announced a broader deal this month to sell the medicines to Medicare for $245. That agreement includes expanding Medicare and Medicaid coverage of the drugs for obesity.\nOverall, the 15 medicines were used by about 5.3 million Medicare enrollees in 2024 and treat a variety of diseases, including asthma, cancer and diabetes. They accounted for $42.5 billion in prescription drug costs in 2024, before factoring in discounts and rebates that Medicare already receives.\nUnder the Medicare drug benefit program in effect in 2024, prior to the Inflation Reduction Act redesign, the savings would have been $8.5 billion or 36%.\nWhile the controversialnegotiation program, which was authorized by the2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was a key way that former President Joe Biden sought to lower drug costs, it has taken a backseat in the Trump administration. Instead, President Donald Trump has opted to prioritize voluntary agreements with individual drugmakers that he says will bring the prices American patients pay in line with the lower ones available in other developed nations.\nThe savings that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services negotiated range from 38% to 85% off the drugs\u2019 list prices. However, this does not reflect the rebates and discounts that Medicare already receives, which are confidential, making the true savings on each medicine harder to discern.\nIn the weeks before announcing the second-round results, Trump administration officials sought to downplay the savings that the Biden administration had achieved on the initial 10 drugs in the first round. At a Cabinet meeting last month, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed that his Democratic predecessors were lying about the savings they said they had wrangled during the first round of negotiations. Kennedy maintained that they achieved a lower price on only one drug.\nThe drug industry has unsuccessfully fought the negotiations program in federal court and continues to maintain that it will do more harm than good.\n\u201cWe have seen that government price setting has not translated to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and can lead to a loss of coverage for medications and higher insurance premiums,\u201d a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday.\nThe Biden administration said last year the federal government wouldsave $6 billionoff 2023 prices in the historic initial round of negotiations, which focused on the 10 most widely used and expensive drugs used by Medicare enrollees. Beneficiaries are set to save $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs on those medications when the prices go into effect in January.\nThe $6 billion in savings for Medicare represents a 22% reduction in total net spending on the medications, which factors in the rebates and discounts, Biden officials said at the time. The Biden administration said it could not provide details about the net cost cuts for each medicine since it is competitive information, though various industry experts have estimated that officials were able to bargain deep discounts on certain medicines but much smaller price reductions on others.\nIt is difficult to compare the results of different rounds of negotiations because the potential for savings depends on the drugs that were selected, the competition they already face in the market and the rebates they already provide to Medicare, said Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University.\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s announcement, she said it was likely that the second round will yield larger savings because it contains more cancer drugs, which typically aren\u2019t heavily discounted. The drug selection process, deadlines and minimum discounts are largely specified in the Inflation Reduction Act.\nShe called the results of the second round \u201csuccessful,\u201d though she would have liked the negotiated prices for the GLP-1 medications to be more in line with the deal Trump struck with Novo Nordisk.\nMany Medicare enrollees will see the savings when they pay for the medications at the pharmacy counter, Dusetzina said. For those that have co-insurance, the prices will be based on the negotiated rate. And the negotiations are expected to slow the growth of premiums in Medicare drug plans.\nLike in his first term, lowering drug prices is one of Trump\u2019s top priorities. But in his second administration, he has opted to strike voluntary deals with individual manufacturers rather than issue regulations or work with Congress to enact laws. He is focused on \u201cmost favored nation\u201d pricing, in which drugmakers sell their products to American patients at the lowest price available in peer countries.\nSo far, he has negotiated similar agreements with five manufacturers that have agreed to provide most favored nation pricing to Medicaid and to use that benchmark to launch new drugs. Also, drugmakers will sell certain medications at a discount directly to consumers through the TrumpRx online platform, which is set to launch early next year. Plus, the companies will invest more in domestic manufacturing, which will earn them a three-year reprieve on tariffs.\nOnly two of the agreements \u2013 with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, makers of blockbuster GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs \u2013 contain specific provisions that would benefit Medicare and certain enrollees.\nEligible Medicare beneficiaries will have a $50 copay for certain GLP-1 medications approved for both obesity and diabetes. The drugmakers will reduce the prices Medicare pays to $245, which will help pay for expanded coverage of weight loss drugs. The prices will take effect in mid-2026.\nHow effective these deals will be in lowering drug costs remains to be seen, experts said. Few details have been released, which makes it difficult to judge.\nWhat is known is that Medicaid already receives substantial discounts from drugmakers. Also, since most drugs launch in the US, it\u2019s unclear what global benchmark manufacturers will use to establish a \u201cmost favored nation\u201d price. And it\u2019s unlikely that most insured consumers will opt to buy their medicine directly from drugmakers since the costs may be higher than those negotiated by their plans.\n\u201cOverall, it\u2019s not a suitable model for controlling drug prices for Americans,\u201d Benjamin Rome, a health policy researcher at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said of Trump\u2019s deals.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/25\/politics\/drug-price-negotiations-save-medicare-12-billion","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"A new threat to affordability \u2013 just in time for winter","date":"2025-12-10","body":"A new problem is threatening to worsen theaffordability squeezethis winter: Natural gas prices have raced back up just as extreme cold forces Americans to crank up the heat.\nPresident Donald Trump has said he\u2019s focused on lowering energy prices. And the most visible energy price for most Americans, gasoline at the pump, has been aclear bright spoton the cost-of-living front.\nBut the progress on gas prices could be offset by the 39% spike in natural gas futures since the end of September. Natural gas recently climbed to the highest level since December 2022 before retreating sharply this week.\nIt\u2019s a double whammy for consumers.\nFirst, natural gas is the most common way to heat homes in America. The higher natural gas prices go, the more expensive it will be for many families to stay warm this winter.\nSecondly, natural gas is by far the No. 1 fuel source powering the nation\u2019s electric grid. Higher natural gas prices could exacerbate the sticker shock consumers are already experiencing when they open their electric bills.\n\u201cAll that money the consumer is saving on gasoline may be eaten up by the soaring price of natural gas,\u201d said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates.\nThe good news is that after jumping on Friday, natural gas prices have tumbled 13% this week.\nStill, even at current levels, natural gas is nearly 50% more expensive than at this point last year.\nNatural gas prices are extremely volatile, and analysts say it\u2019s unclear at this point whether prices will continue to retreat or resume their recent climb.\nGovernment forecasts don\u2019t expect natural gas to crash back to earth anytime soon.\nThe Energy Information Administrationramped up its natural gas price forecastby about 10% on Tuesday from its November forecast, citing the \u201ccold snap\u201d in the United States that will drive up demand for heating.\nAfter averaging just $2.19 per million BTU in 2024, the EIA expects natural gas to average $3.56 this year and $4.01 in 2026.\nIt takes time for those higher natural gas prices to filter through to Americans\u2019 utility bills.\nHouseholds that use natural gas for heating are expected to experience a 3% jump in heating prices this winter, according to the EIA. That\u2019s despite the fact that consumption is expected to be 2% lower.\nThe biggest price hikes are expected in the Northeast (4%) and the Midwest (7%), whereas heating costs in the West are forecasted to be flat and down 3% in the South.\nThis isn\u2019t just a wintertime problem.\nHigher natural gas prices will contribute to higher electric bills.\nAccording to federal data, natural gas accounts for about 40% of US electricity generation \u2013 more than the next two fuel sources, coal and nuclear, combined.\nElectricity prices have already been rising sharply.\nResidential electricity prices increased by 7.4% over the 12 months ending in September, the most recent monthfederal datais available. That\u2019s more than twice the rate of inflation.\nBut the sticker shock is even greater in certain states, including Virginia (9%) and New Jersey (21%), two states where Democrats seized upon the issue in key gubernatorial wins last month.\nSo why is natural gas getting more expensive?\nPart of the problem is supply.\nAnalysts say natural gas producers, especially public ones, have been apprehensive to ramp up production out of fear they\u2019ll cause a supply glut that crashes prices.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been burned badly before. No one wants that to happen again. There is a certain degree of reluctance,\u201d said Robert Yawger, commodity specialist at Mizuho Securities.\nAnother factor: cheap oil.\nNatural gas is a byproduct of drilling for crude oil. But oil drilling has slowed in recent months because crude is relatively inexpensive. That means so-called associated natural gas could take a hit. (Of course, cheap oil has helped keep a lid on prices for homes that rely on home heating oil to stay warm.)\nOn the demand side, a relatively new phenomenon is that a significant chunk of natural gas produced in the United States is getting shipped overseas as liquified natural gas (LNG).\nThe EIA expects LNG exports to average 16.3 billion cubic feet per day next year, up 37% from 2024.\nLNG exports are helping to supply US allies with relatively inexpensive energy, including European nations attempting to wean themselves off Russian gas.\nBut that also leaves less natural gas for Americans.\n\u201cThat\u2019s obviously contributing. These are molecules going overseas that were historically going to the consumer in the United States,\u201d said Yawger, who estimates about 15% to 20% of the natural gas is getting exported.\nNew LNG export facilities are being built and slated to come online soon, potentially adding to demand.\nYawger emphasized that, at the end of the day, there\u2019s no risk of running out of natural gas. If Americans need to produce more natural gas, it can be done relatively quickly.\nBut it could take a period of higher prices to encourage that production.\nAnother factor on the demand side: Artificial intelligence.\nThe data centers that act as the brains of the AI boom are sucking up enormous amounts of power \u2013 including natural gas.\n\u201cThis is demand that I don\u2019t think the market really anticipated as recently as a year ago,\u201d said Patrick Rau, senior vice president of research and analysis at Natural Gas Intelligence.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/10\/business\/winter-heat-energy-prices","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump is right: He lowered some of your costs. But he also made many prices higher","date":"2025-11-17","body":"President Donald Trump keepsdownplaying America\u2019s affordability crisis, and he continues to falsely claim that inflation and overall prices have fallen during his second term.\n\u201cOur prices are coming down very substantially on groceries and things,\u201d Trump told reporters in Florida Sunday evening. \u201cThey\u2019re already at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.\u201d\nThe truth is annualinflation stood at 3%in September. Grocery prices havegained 1.4%between January and September, and US consumer prices haverisen 1.7%on average during Trump\u2019s second term, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nBut that\u2019s just an average. Look a little more closely, and Trump really can claim credit forsomefalling prices. But he is also to blame for somerisingprices.\nA complex mix of factors determines the price of any particular item.As anyone who took Econ 101 remembers, supply and demand remain the primary influences over consumer prices. But commodity costs, wholesale prices, transportation and fuel concerns, regulations, labor and a whole host of other considerations can weigh on what people ultimately pay at the store.\nBut Trump\u2019s policies, perhaps more than any president\u2019s in recent memory, have directly influenced the prices on thousands of consumer goods \u2013 both lower and higher.\nDrugs:Pharmaceuticals remain the the most prominent example of Trump directly influencing prices lower. Trump has put significant pressure on drugmakers to lower prices, and many have followed suit.\nMost recently, Trump and his administration announced that certainblockbuster obesity drugswill be available for as little as $149 per month, significantly lower than the list prices, which can top $1,000. Trump has also announced deals withPfizer,AstraZenecaand others to set prices of new medications at\u201cMost Favored Nation\u201dlevels, the lowest price made available in peer countries.\nEggs:When Trump took office, egg prices had been surging because a deadly avian flu epidemic devastated the egg-laying hen population. Egg prices peaked above$8 a dozen in late Februaryafter rising steadily over the previous year.\nA couple weeks into Trump\u2019s term, hisUSDA announced an initiativeto lower prices by increasing biosecurity on egg-laying farms, providing aid to farmers who lost flocks and temporarily lifting restrictions on egg imports. The plan worked: Egg prices have since fallen to just over $2 a dozen.\nOil:Trump dismantled many oil drilling regulations that he claimed would expand US oil production \u2013 but, so far at least, that hasn\u2019t made any meaningful difference. Trump, however, publicly pressured OPEC+ on prices, and though the group of oil-producing nations denied Trump had anything to do with its decision, OPEC+ boosted production several times this year, and US oil fell below $60 a barrel \u2013 down from $75 when Trump took office.\nIndustry experts havepartially attributedOPEC\u2019s decision to Trump\u2019s influence, although they also say OPEC\u2019s hand may have been forced by nations that acted independently of the group. And oil prices have ebbed and flowed with sinking demand and on-and-off Middle East conflicts throughout the year, as well.\nTrump has also announced some policies that could have long-term benefits for consumers but whose effects remain to be seen.\nBeef and fruit:Last week, Trump signed executive orders thatlowered tariffson imported beef and other produce that mostly grows overseas. That could lower some of those prices, but the tariff cuts largely justrestore import prices to where they werebefore Trump launched his sweeping trade war.\nCars:Trump\u2019s domestic policy and tax billdid away with a number of financial penaltieson automakers that fail to meet fuel efficiency rules. That is saving some US automakers billions of dollars a year and could cut the cost of building a vehicle by 3% to 5%, according to Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities. But that may not translate to lower consumer prices because Trump also raised tariff costs on automakers.\nTariffs:By far the largest price increase on consumers that Trump has imposed came in the form of his sweeping tariffs on virtually every foreign country\u2019s goods. That has raised the effective US tariff rate to 13.6%, up from 1.2% in 2024 \u2013 a gigantic tax increase that has raised the average American household\u2019s costs this year by $1,200, according to the conservative-leaningTax Foundation.\nThe calculation is tricky, because tariffs are paid by US importers who typically pass those costs onto wholesalers, retailers and eventually consumers. JPMorgan this month estimated that consumers are currently paying about 20% of tariffs\u2019 costs, but many businesses have announced they can no longer afford to eat those expenses and will soon be forced to raise consumer prices. That\u2019s why the Tax Foundation estimates the average household\u2019s annual costs will rise by $1,600 because of Trump\u2019s tariffs next year.\nBenefits cuts:Historiccuts to America\u2019s safety net programs, including Medicaid and food stamps, will raise out-of-pocket expenses for the country\u2019s neediest: Those earning less than $18,000 a year will have to spend more than 1% more going forward because of Trump\u2019s tax and spending policy bill, according toPenn Wharton\nThe bill also cut some popular tax credits, including the$7,500that the government chipped in when customers bought electric vehicles.\nAmerica\u2019s debt:Trump\u2019s massive tax cut and spending bill will add nearly $4 trillion to America\u2019s $36 trillion in debt, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. That briefly sent the bond market into a tizzy in May, leading US Treasury yields\ufeff, which trade in opposite direction to prices, significantly higher. Investors had effectively sent a warning that they may be unwilling to keep funding the government\u2019s coffers unless they get paid more for it.\nYields have since come down \u2013 but not by a ton. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which influences mortgage, credit card and auto loan rates, remains above 4.1%.\nTrump\u2019s spending and economic policies have also hurt the dollar, which has fallen more than 8% this year. That can boost the appeal of US-made goods abroad, but it also makes foreign goods more expensive for Americans.\nMeanwhile, Trump has effectively tried to will lower prices into existence,recently callingAmerica\u2019s affordability crisis a \u201clie\u201d and a \u201ccomplete con job.\u201d The White House, while casting blame elsewhere, acknowledged it has some work to do.\n\u201cThe Trump Administration will not rest until the high prices that resulted from Democrat policies are fully reined in,\u201d the White House said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress \u2014 and the best is yet to come.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/17\/business\/trump-prices-affordability","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Phones might get pricier next year. Thank the AI boom","date":"2025-12-05","body":"Fancy cameras, giant screens andmassive storageusually make smartphones more expensive. But next year, it\u2019s a routine component that might be boosting prices: memory.\nAnd it\u2019s not just phones. Any device that uses memory, from phones to tablets and smartwatches, could get pricier.\nMemory prices are rising for consumer products because major manufacturers are instead ramping up production for AI data centers as artificial intelligence companies boom.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much brutal and crunched across the board,\u201d said Yang Wang, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.\nTheInternational Data Corporation, a global market research firm, reported earlier this week that the smartphone market is expected to decline by 0.9% in 2026 in part because of memory shortages. Memory prices are expected to surge by 30% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and may climb an additional 20% early next year,Counterpoint Researchsaid last month.\nTech companies like Meta, Microsoft and Google have aggressively expanded theirdata centers and infrastructurethis year to keep up with AI demand. And that growth is expected to continue: A report fromMcKinsey & Companyindicates companies will invest nearly $7 trillion in data center infrastructure-related costs globally by 2030.\nThat\u2019s prompted memory manufacturers like Micron and Samsung to shift their focus to data centers, which usea different type of memorythan computers and smartphones. As a result, there are fewer resources for consumer products, said Wang.\nMemory and storage companyMicron announced on Wednesdaythat it\u2019s exiting the consumer memory business, citing a \u201csurge in demand\u201d coming from \u201cAI-driven growth\u201d in data centers.\nJaejune Kim, executive vice president for memory at Samsung, said in October that the companysaw strong demand for memory for AI and data centers in the third quarter. He also said the supply shortage for mobile and PC memory is expected to \u201cintensify further.\u201d\nGadget makers may have to face tough decisions about when to launch and how to price their products, analysts say.TrendForce, a research firm that follows the semiconductor industry, estimates memory price hikes have made smartphones 8% to 10% more expensive to produce in 2025 (higher production costs don\u2019t always translate into higher consumer prices for a variety of reasons).\nSome smartphones could cost moreas soon as early next year, said Nabila Popal, a senior research director for the International Data Corporation. Cheap Android phones may see the biggest impact, since less expensive products usually have thinner margins.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be almost impossible for them to not raise prices\u201d of cheaper Android phones,said Popal.\nCompanies may also postpone phone launches to focus on expensive models that may be more profitable. The average selling price for smartphones is expected to climb to $465 in 2026, compared to $457 in 2025, according to Popal, putting the smartphone market at a record high value of $578.9 billion.\nBut the pendulum is expected to swing back in the other direction late next year as the supply chain adjusts, according to Popal and Wang, potentially bringing prices back down or at least capping increases.\nThe semiconductor industry is used to grappling with change as new technologies emerge, says Wang. But it may have not been prepared for how quickly AI demand would grow.\n\u201cIn the semiconductor space, there\u2019s always going to be a mismatch (in supply and demand),\u201d he said. \u201cThis was kind of unexpected.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/05\/tech\/memory-shortage-phone-computer-prices","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"What got more expensive in September","date":"2025-10-24","body":"Here\u2019s a rundown of what got more expensive inSeptember\u2019s Consumer Price Indexreport \u2014 as well as a couple of key areas where consumers are seeing relief.\nBut first, a caveat: Monthly data can be quite volatile \u2014 and that could be even more volatile amid federal cuts and BLS staffing limitations that have impacted how data is collected \u2014 so it\u2019s important to look at longer-term trends.\nGrocery prices bolted higher in August, rising 0.6%, which was the highest in nearly three years; however, in September, they rose at a comparably modest 0.3%. For the year, they\u2019re running below overall inflation at a 2.7% rate, BLS data shows.\nThe dairy case is doing its part to cool down overall food-at-home inflation: Egg prices have dropped after theavian flu-related issues were resolved, and plentiful production and supply for milk and butter and food oils have kept price hikes at bay.\nThe same can\u2019t be said for other aisles in the grocery store.\nBeef and veal:In September, prices for uncooked beef roasts rose 4.8%, their largest increase in four years. The broader beef and veal index rose 1.2% in September and is up 14.7% from a year before.\nIn recent months, the average price of beef has hit record highs, a milestone caused by ayearslong trendof drought, shrinking herds and the rise of imported beef.\nLunchmeats:The beef trend doesn\u2019t bode well here. Prices of the handy sandwich fixings rose 4.2%, the largest on record for the category.\nFresh sweetrolls, coffeecakes, doughnuts:Cue the \u201cd\u2019oh\u201d from the doughtnut-loving crowd. In September, prices for these delectable baked goods rose 5.7%. That\u2019s the highest monthly increase for that category in more than 26 years.\nIt\u2019s likely one part lagged effect from prior price spikes in main ingredients (like eggs wheat, spices and sugar) and one part post-pandemic changes in consumer demand and labor patterns, BLS researchers noted earlier this year when analyzed baked goods prices.\nCoffee:America\u2019s favorite caffeinated beverage actually got cheaper in September \u2014 this index fell by 0.1%. But this is where that monthly caveat comes in hand: September\u2019s little dip comes after seven consecutive months of price hikes ranging from 0.9% to 3.6%.\nFor the year, coffee prices are up 18.9%. It\u2019s even worse if you like the quick fix of instant \u2014 that\u2019s up 21.7%, which is the highest annual inflation since the summer of 1995.And it\u2019s very possible it won\u2019t stop thereif President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to enact steeper tariffs on Colombian shipments. Key coffee-exporter Brazil also faces a 50% levy.\nAt-home care for elderly and people with disabilities: Prices here soared 7% in September, marking the highest-ever monthly increase for this category (which the BLS started tracking in December 2005). On an annual basis, they\u2019re up 11.6%.\nHealth care costs are on the rise, and that\u2019s especially been the case for the care economy, where providers arefacing funding shortfalls(that have been exacerbated by new budget cuts). That has contributed to low wages, which have led to worker shortages (now exacerbated byimmigration reductions), which in turn have resulted in care deserts, further putting upward pressure on prices \u2014 and, in turn,negative labor market outcomes.\nAdmission to sporting events:The kick-off to football season came with a heftier hit to the pocketbook. The price for fandom went up 3.7% from August, according to BLS data, which accounts for seasonality.\nOn an annual basis, sporting event tickets are down by about 6.9%; however, this category might be highlighting a \u201cK-shaped economy\u201d trend that\u2019s influencing pricing.\n\u201cConsumers at the higher end of the income spectrum are still spending relatively freely on discretionary services, and that is putting upward pressure on airfares and on hotel prices\u201d and other related categories, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon.\nAirline fares:Ticket prices were up 2.7% on a monthly basis, further driving the annual rate to 3.2%.\nTrump\u2019s substantial and widespread tariffs are having an effect on overall inflation, but instead of a surge, the pass-through to consumers has beenongoing, gradual and uneven(for a multitude of reasons).\nIt\u2019s a slow bleed that\u2019s expected to continue into early next year, but some of the impacts are already being felt.\n\u201cThe grocery segment, of course, is one of the prime ones,\u201d Daco said. \u201cYes, we do produce some fruits and vegetables and some meat, but we also import a lot of produce and other items that are in our grocery stores.\u201d\nSo, it makes sense why products like bananas (+6.9% annually), canned fruits and vegetables (+5%)and sugar and sweets (+6.7%) are rising at their fastest annual rates in years.\nThe tariffs are also showing up in other non-grocery goods that saw notable price increases in September:\nWatches:Monthly price shifts in this category can be quite volatile; however, the trend in recent years \u2014 as with many other goods \u2014 is generally one of falling prices. That wasn\u2019t the case in August, when watch prices went up 1.9%, or in September, when they rose 3.2%, bringing the annual rate to 6.6%.\nIn August, the United States imposed a 39% tariff on Switzerland,which is one of the top exporters of watches to America.\nBoys\u2019 apparel:The back-to-school shopping season was met with plenty of sticker shock in August, and that continued in September. This category rose 2.6%, which was the largest monthly increase in more than a year.\nMany articles of clothing and accessories are made outside the United States in countries such as Bangladesh, China, India and Vietnam,leaving them greatly exposed to tariffs.\nFurniture and appliances:Shelter-related services inflation, which carries the biggest weight in the CPI, slowed further in September. But the prices of goods that fill homes definitely did not.\n\u201cOther furniture,\u201d which can include desks, bookcases and the like, saw price increases of 1.9%, the highest in nearly two years and is at its highest annual inflation rate in nearly three years. There\u2019s a similar story for appliances, which are up 1.3% from the year before (after a 0.8% rise in September).\nTrump in recent months extended tariffs toappliancesand has vowed to enacteven more \u201csubstantial\u201d tariffs on furniture.\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan and Elisabeth Buchwald contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/24\/economy\/us-cpi-september-expensive","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"K-shaped economy and inflation boost Black Friday sales by 4.1% from last year, online spending jumps 9.1%","date":"2025-11-29","body":"US retail sales on Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, climbed 4.1% compared with last year, according to data released Saturday by Mastercard SpendingPulse. Online shoppers alonespent $11.8 billion, up 9.1% from 2024, according to data collection platform Adobe Analytics.\nBut those gains don\u2019t account for higher prices due toinflation, so actual spending could be flat.\n\u201cWe have 3% inflation, so maybe (the 4.1% increase in spending) is a real increase of just 1% or so, which is not that much of an increase,\u201d Rick Newman, who writes The Pinpoint Press, a newsletter on the US economy, told CNN on Friday.\nThere\u2019s also a bifurcation in who\u2019s spending. The Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes about the economy, showed consumer spending among low- and middle-income consumers is on the decline. Meanwhile, the Fed found high-end consumers are continuing to spend \u2014 including on luxury items and travel.\nConsumers have bought fewer items this holiday season, but the average selling prices are higher, according to Claudia Lombana, a national consumer expert.\n\u201cThe ones that have higher income are spending at will, but those who are less affluent are budgeting,\u201d Lombana told CNN\u2019s Omar Jimenez on Saturday.\nIt\u2019s part of the so-called K-shaped economy, in which higher earners get a boost from their stock market investments and home valuations and use their fatter paychecks to spend. But lower earnersincreasingly live paycheck to paycheckand look for discounts \u2014 or curtail their spending to cope with rising prices.\n\u201cThe story of the economy right now is it\u2019s a bifurcated economy. If you\u2019re lucky enough to own stocks and own a home, you\u2019re part of the upper slant of that cave, that K-shaped economy \u2026 you\u2019re going to be comfortable spending a fair amount of money this year,\u201d Newman said.\nBut Newman added that people on the lower slant of the K \u2014 those who don\u2019t own stocks or a home \u2014 are increasingly worried about job security.\n\u201cI think those people are going to be pinching pennies this holiday season,\u201d he said, adding that they will be more frugal with gift purchases and necessities.Heating bills, for instance, are higher because of natural gas prices going up. Andgrocery pricesare on the rise, while rent hikes outpace income growth, he noted.\nEighty-five percent of consumersexpect higher pricesbecause of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to the National Retail Federation, or NRF. And it\u2019s a factor in how they shop.\n\u201cNobody is sort of going on an item-by-item basis and saying, \u2018Oh, the Trump tariffs have pushed up costs here by 4% or 10%,\u2019 but it\u2019s on people\u2019s minds,\u201d Newman said.\nValue is more important than ever these days for consumers. Consumer sentiment is glum, job growth has slowed, and the federal government shutdown forced low-income shoppers to pull back spending amid a pause in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funding.\nAs goods and services become harder for everyday Americans to afford, shoppers have grown pickier about how they spend their money and hunt for deals. They are gravitating toward retailers they feel can help them stretch their dollars further on groceries, household essentials, clothing and electronics.\nChains such as Walmart, TJ Maxx, Gap and others are benefiting, reporting strong sales during their latest quarters. Walmart is now gaining market share against competitors across all income groups and in several merchandise categories.\nBut others, such as Target and Bath & Body Works, are struggling.\nAnd people are splurging less on gifts for themselves, according to Bath & Body Works.\nShoppers are expected to continue tosplash out this holiday season, despite the cost-of-living squeeze and other economic pressures. The NRF expects retail sales in November and December to grow 3.7% to 4.2% compared with a year ago. That growth would be similar to last year\u2019s rise.\nThe NRF projects arecord $1 trillion in holiday spendingthis year, up from $976 billion last year.\nSpending growth on apparel grew 6.1% online and 5.4% in-store on Black Friday, with Mastercard suggesting that \u201cshoppers refreshed wardrobes while leaning into value-driven choices and convenience.\u201d Consumers\u202fspent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving, up 5.3% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics, asbig deals drew them to shop online.\n\u201cThe magnitude of discounts was the big story on Thanksgiving yesterday, as retailers leaned into delivering great deals to drive consumer demand online,\u201d Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe, said in a statement Friday.\nMeanwhile, \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d continues to be an important payment option for consumers this holiday season. Adobe forecasts $20.2 billion will be spent through the payment method from November 1 to December 31, an 11% uptick over 2024.\n\u201cWe saw half the people in America already shopping by Halloween this year for the holiday period,\u201d said Lombana. \u201cOf course, this five-day period from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday is significant for retailers, both online and in store. We are expecting to see Cyber Monday deliver strong.\u201d\nShe noted that \u201cconsumers are definitely being more cautious, but during the holidays, they also want to engage in the holiday spirit.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/29\/business\/black-friday-us-econony-spending","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

And they have increased since the start of his presidency.\nAverage grocery prices rose 0.3% from August to September, according toConsumer Price Index figuresreleased Friday. That increase followed a 0.6% jump from July to August, which was the biggest month-to-month jumpin three years.\nAverage grocery prices in September wereabout 2.7% higherthan they were a year prior and about 1.4% higher than they were in January, the month Trump returned to office.\nThe grocery price increases have been broad, spanning the vast majority of product categories tracked by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nPrices in four of the six major grocery categories increased from August to September. The cereals and bakery products category was up 0.7%; the nonalcoholic beverages category was also up 0.7%; the meats, poultry, fish and eggs category was up 0.3%; the \u201cother food at home\u201d category was up 0.5%. The fruits and vegetables category was unchanged, while the dairy and related products category was down 0.5%.\nPrices in all six categories have increased over the past year. Since September 2024, the nonalcoholic beverages category was up 5.3%; the meats, poultry, fish, and eggs category was up 5.2%; the \u201cother food at home\u201d category was up 1.9%; the cereals and bakery products category was up 1.6%; the fruits and vegetables category was up 1.3%; and the dairy and related products category was up 0.7%.\nThere have been particularly sharp increases since September 2024 in the prices of coffee (up 18.9%) and beef and veal (up 14.7%). Overall consumer prices are up 3.0% since September 2024.\nTrumpcampaignedona promise to reduce grocery prices. Since returning to the White House, he has claimed over and over that he has actually done so \u2013 ignoring the federal data that shows he has not.\nHe continued to make such claims even after the September release of theprevious Consumer Price Index reportthat showed the 0.6% increase in average grocery prices from July to August.\n\u201cGrocery prices are way down,\u201d hesaidTuesday.\u202f \u201cGroceries are down,\u201d hesaidOctober 16. \u201cNow, as you know, groceries are down,\u201d hesaidOctober 14. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten prices way down for\u202fgroceries,\u201d hesaidOctober 10. \u201cUnder my leadership\u2026grocery prices are down,\u201d hetoldworld leaders at the United Nations on September 23.\nIt\u2019s normal for grocery prices to rise over time, as overall prices tend to do, and there is always a complicated mix of domestic and international factors at play. This year\u2019s inflation in grocery prices is markedly lower than the 2022spikesthat followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and it\u2019s important to note that food prices can be volatile for reasons like severe weather, unexpected supply chain snarls and other temporary disruptions.\nBut food economists like Michigan State University professorDavid Ortegasay two of Trump\u2019s signature policies \u2013 tariffs on imported goods (including food) and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants (who make up a large percentage of the US farm workforce) \u2013 have clearly contributed to the increases in grocery prices this year.\n\u201cThis uptick in food prices is consistent with what we would expect the effects of some of the administration\u2019s policies to have on food,\u201d Ortega said.\nOrtega noted that there have been recent spikes in the average consumer prices ofcoffeeandbananas, two products that are almost entirely imported in the US, as well as other grocery items sometimes subject to significant tariffs, includingbeef. \u201cYou can\u2019t attribute all of\u201d those price hikes to the tariffs, he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m pretty confident in saying the tariffs and the current trade policy is contributing to these increases that we\u2019re seeing.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/24\/politics\/fact-check-grocery-prices-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Ford will raise the sticker price on cars imported from Mexico. It just said it didn\u2019t expect significant US price hikes","date":"2025-05-07","body":"Ford is hiking the sticker prices for the three US models it imports from Mexico by up to $2,000 each, just days after executives said they didn\u2019t expect significant increases in industrywide car prices this year.\nThe price increase was disclosed in a memo sent to Ford dealerships, first reported byReutersbut confirmed by Ford. Ford said the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price (MSRP), also known as the \u201csticker price,\u201d would increase between $600 to $2,000 per vehicle, depending on the features.Ford said the price hike doesn\u2019t apply to vehicles currently on the lot, but will apply tothose built after May 2, which start arriving at dealerships in several weeks.\n\u201cThis is our usual mid-year pricing actions combined with some tariffs we are facing,\u201d Ford spokesman Said Deep told CNN. \u201cWe have not passed on the full cost of tariffs to our customers. Our approach throughout this evolving situation continues to be doing what\u2019s right for our customers \u2013 and our business.\u201d\nSince April 3, imported vehicles have faced a tariff of up to 25%. Most of the major automakers import some of their US vehicles from foreign plants, including those in Mexico. Ford assembles three US models in Mexico: the Ford Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle, the Maverick midsize pickup and the Bronco Sport, an entry-level SUV. Those models accounted for about 17% of Ford\u2019s first quarter US sales.\n\ufeffThe price hike does not mean customers will necessarily pay $2,000 more per vehicle. Retail prices are set across millions of individual negotiations between buyers and dealers, although the MSRP is typically a starting point.\nDespite the tariff on car imports, and an additional tariff on imported parts raising the cost of production, most automakers have been slow to announce price increases pegged to import taxes.\nFord said last week it would continue to offer customers the promotional \u201cemployee pricing\u201d through July 4. Ford says it has a sufficient inventory of vehicles built and imported before tariffs took effect to handle purchases through that date.\nDuring a media briefing Monday, Ford CFO Sherry House would not comment on Ford\u2019s own pricing plans,but said she didn\u2019t expect new car pricing in the United States to increase significantly. Ford itself said it expects the tariffs will cost it about $1.5 billion through the rest of this year.\n\u201cWe now expect industry pricing related to tariffs (to increase) about 1% to 1.5% in the second half,\u201d she said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/07\/business\/ford-sticker-prices-tariffs-mexico","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump is threatening to get rid of one of the biggest reasons prices have remained in check","date":"2025-12-05","body":"When President Donald Trump introduced his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April, many economistspredictedAmericans would soon experience massive price increases. While inflationhas ticked upin the eight months that passed, it\u2019s been nowhere near levels initially projected.\nA big reason for that: Nearly everything from clothing to toothpaste produced by America\u2019s top two trading partners, Mexico and Canada, has been exempt from duties if goods comply with the terms of a trilateral free-trade agreement known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), whichTrump inked during his first term.\nBut the deal, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, is scheduled to undergo a review in July, and already Trump is signaling he wants out. If that happens, it likely would usher in a floodgate of higher prices from which Americans have so far been shielded.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll either let it expire or we\u2019ll maybe work out another deal with Mexico and Canada,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also said in a Politico interview, \u201cthe reason why we built a review period into USMCA was in case we needed to revise it, review it or exit it.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s stance could change between now and July, and the White House told CNNthat. \u201cDiscussion about what hypothetical trade deals that have not yet been negotiated could look like is meaningless speculation,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai said.\nPrior to Trump\u2019s second term, goods from Mexico and Canada essentially entered the US duty-free even if they weren\u2019t USMCA compliant because there weren\u2019t tariffs in place. But Trump introduced tariffs of 25% on non-USMCA-compliant products from Mexico and 35% from Canada.\nTrump\u2019s trade war is pushing Canada closer to China\nUnlike those two countries, every other nation\u2019s exports to the United States have been subject to higher tariffs over the past year, barring exemptions for certain goods. Those rates at one point went as high as 145% in the case of China.\nPrior to Trump\u2019s second term, goods from Mexico and Canada essentially entered the US duty-free even if they weren\u2019t USMCA compliant because there weren\u2019t tariffs in place. That helps explain why 38% of imports from Canada and 49% of imports from Mexico were USMCA compliant last year, according to US Commerce Department data. But as of August this year, those shares rose to nearly 86% of imports from Canada and 87% of imports from Mexico.\n\u201cIncreased compliance with USMCA has shielded billions of dollars\u2019 worth of imports from the new tariffs,\u201d said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation.\nIf USMCA exemptions weren\u2019t in place, \u201cAmericans would face significantly higher prices,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would make American workers poorer and American businesses less competitive, and for no good reason.\u201d\nConsumer electronics and clothing are among the goods that could be most vulnerable to price increases, given that the United States has become more reliant on its neighbors for such items.\nAdditionally, supply chains across all three countries havegrown more intertwined, with components often crossing the American border multiple times during the assembly process. That means that even apparel and electronics, as well as other domestically produced goods, could be impacted by potentially higher tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and get passed on to consumers.\n\u201cUSMCA is a cornerstone of North America\u2019s electronics manufacturing ecosystem. Terminating it would disrupt the production system that US manufacturers rely on, leading to longer lead times and higher input costs,\u201d said Chris Mitchell, vice president for global government relations at the Global Electronics Association. \u201cThose pressures would ultimately translate into higher prices for automotive, consumer, and medical electronics.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/05\/economy\/trump-usmca-tariffs-prices","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Car prices are in check. But get ready for sticker shock on repair bills","date":"2025-09-21","body":"Despite billions in tariff costs for imported autos and parts, new car prices have stayed relatively flat. But the news isn\u2019t as good for car owners taking their vehicles to the repair shop.\nThe price of car repairs jumped 5% just from July to August, according to the latest Consumer Price Index, the government\u2019s key inflation measure. That\u2019s the largest one-month increase on record, and the cost of repairs is now up 15% compared to a year ago.\nBut despite what you might think, it\u2019s not just tariffs driving up the price of repairs. That\u2019s even though tariffs, which are a US tax on imports, took effect on all imported partsin May.\n\u201cThere\u2019s quite a few factors,\u201d said Skyler Chadwick, director of product consulting, Cox Automotive.\nThe growing age of vehicles on the road, a technician shortage lifting wages in the sector, and more complex vehicles are also to blame, Chadwick said.\nTariffs are definitely part of the reason Americans are paying more at the shop \u2013 auto parts, especially after-market parts used in repairs, are primarily imported and therefore subject to tariffs of 25%.\n\u201cDo I believe tariffs have been an impact on this? You betcha,\u201d Chadwick said.\nHe points out that there\u2019s no US-made car with 100% American parts. So even if your American-made car needs maintenance or repairs, there\u2019s a good chance the part is going to be coming from Mexico or somewhere else overseas.\n\u201cThe cost of parts has gone through the roof because we have to pull those parts in from other parts of the world,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou could be a lucky customer who draws that lottery ticket and needs an American part. Otherwise, your part is subject to a 25% increase.\u201d\nSo far, many manufacturers have done their best to keep new car prices little changed, often by absorbing much of the tariff cost themselves.\nThat\u2019s partly to avoid angering the Trump administration, especially as automakers have gotten breaks on regulations. That includes the elimination of  potential fines they used to face for violating emissions rules, the threat of which forced them to spend billions on regulatory credits to greener automakers. Those fines were repealed as part of the Republican party\u2019s tax and spending bill passed this summer.\nCar companies also know that car prices are already near record levels. Affordability is a major concern for car buyers, especially with the current high rates for car loans.\n\u201cAutomakers have been extremely reluctant to let consumers see the cost of tariffs show up in sticker prices,\u201d said Patrick Anderson, president of the Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based think tank.\nBut there\u2019s less pressure to keep the prices of car parts in check. That\u2019s because there\u2019s less attention paid directly to them, and also because owners aren\u2019t able to shop around for better prices on the specific part a car might need.\nBeyond tariffs, a primary issue driving up the price of repairs is the fact car owners are hanging onto cars longer than they have in the past, Chadwick said. The high price of new cars, and growing economic uncertainty, is prompting many to grit their teeth and pay for repairs rather than buy a replacement.\n\u201cIn 2024, we saw the average vehicle age at 12.6 years. Now in 2025, we see that number jump to 12.8 (years),\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s actually quite a big jump. We haven\u2019t seen a jump like that in quite some time.\u201d\nThe increased age of vehicles on the road means most repairs will be pricey, Chadwick said.\n\u201cThe older the vehicles, the more likely they will require major services \u2013 things like transmissions, suspension items, engine rebuilds \u2013 the types of things that are the most costly.\u201d\nCar prices, and high interest rates, are keeping car buyers on the sidelines, and car repair shops busy.\nThe average transaction price of a new car in August was $48,365, according to car buying site Edmunds. That\u2019s down 2% from December\u2019s record high, but up $11,400, or more than 30%, from August 2019. Used car prices on average are also up 26% over the same period, with the price of the lower-mileage cars that are three years old or younger up 40%.\nAnd that is before high interest rates on auto loans are factored in, which have resulted in huge car payments for many borrowers. More than 15% of all new car payments, including both loans and leases, are more than $1,000 a month, a record share, according to Experian. More than 30% of used car buyers are paying $600 a month or more.\n\u201cWhen consumers find new vehicles more expensive, they spend more time and money repairing existing vehicles,\u201d said Anderson.\nLabor costs also can make up about 60% of the asking price of repair, Chadwick said. And a shortage of qualified repair workers is raising those costs, especially as cars are increasingly loaded with more advanced technology.\nThe most recent data from the Labor Department showed auto repair wages rising 7% between 2023 and 2024.\n\u201cThe technician shortage is a huge thing. Labor (cost) is going to continue to increase,\u201d Chadwick said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/21\/business\/car-repair-prices-soaring","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Analysis: How the White House is using misleading comparisons to make inflation sound better","date":"2025-12-11","body":"The year-over-yearinflation ratein January, the month President Donald Trump returned to the White House,was 3.0%.\nThe year-over-year inflation rate in September, the most recent month for which Consumer Price Index figures have been released, was \u2026the same, 3.0%.\nThe fact that the inflation rate eight months into Trump\u2019s term was unchanged from the one he inherited has debunked his triumphant claims that \u201cinflation has stopped\u201d after he \u201cinherited the worst inflation in the history of our country.\u201d\u202fSo what is a White House to do when the real comparisons aren\u2019t working in its favor?\nTrump\u2019s team has chosen to use some misleading comparisons \u2013 deploying apples-to-oranges sets of statistics to serve Trump\u2019s point. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried it from the podium on Thursday.\nKaitlan Collins, CNN anchor and chief White House correspondent, noted to Leavitt that inflation is about where it was last year, thatgrocery prices are up, and that economic signals are mixed. Leavittclaimed: \u201cInflation is down from where it was, as measured by the overall CPI; it has slowed to an average 2.5%. This is down from what the president inherited. The president inherited 2.9% in January\u201d \u2013 it was2.9% in December\u2013 \u201ctoday it\u2019s at about 2.5%. So we\u2019re trending in the right direction with more to come.\u201d\nBut the inflation rate is not \u201ctrending in the right direction,\u201d or at least wasn\u2019t as of the most recent available numbers (the November numbers come out next week). In fact, September was the fifth consecutive month the year-over-year inflation rate increased from the month prior, Consumer Price Index figures show. Specifically, the rate was 2.3% in April, 2.4% in May, 2.67% in June, 2.7% in July, 2.9% in August, and, again, 3.0% in September.\nSo what was Leavitt talking about when she spoke of Trump achieving a 2.5% average? She explained later in the briefing. When another reporterreminded herthat the most recent inflation rate is the same 3.0% it was in January, not \u201c2.5%,\u201d Leavitt said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s 2.5%. It\u2019s 2.5%, the average CPI right now; I have it in front of me: In President Trump\u2019s first eight months in office, inflation, as measured by the overall Consumer Price Index, has slowed to a 2.5% average pace.\u201d\nIn summary: after Leavitt was reminded of the inflation rate for a particular month, January, she cited an average of eight months of inflation rates from February through September. That\u2019s not a like-to-like comparison. And the eight-month average conveniently understates the current inflation challenge because it incorporates the lower rates from Trump\u2019s first three months back in office, before and immediately after the presidentannouncedhis sweeping global tariffs in early April. Inflationbegan accelerating in May.\nAlso, it\u2019s worth noting a smaller point: 2.5% isn\u2019t even the simple arithmetic \u201caverage.\u201d The simple average of the last eight months of year-over-year inflation rates is 2.7% \u2013 the figure the White House used in asocial media graphicin late November and thatLeavitt herself citedat the beginning of the Thursday briefing. The White House explained to CNN later on Thursday that Leavitt was citing the eight-month\u201cannualized\u201d ratewhen she invoked the \u201c2.5%\u201d figure, though she did not use the word \u201cannualized\u201d herself.\nThe comparison in that White House social media graphic\u202fwas even more unmistakably misleading.\nIn large text, the graphic said \u201c9.1% Inflation under Biden\u201d and \u201c2.7% Inflation under Trump.\u201d Only in much smaller text did it explain that this, too, was an apples-to-oranges comparison.\nWhile the 2.7% rate the graphic attributed to Trump is the eight-month average for this Trump term through September, the 9.1% rate it attributed to Biden is the single one-monthpeakrate for the Biden presidency, the rate inJune 2022. For obvious reasons, the graphic did not note that the rate had plummeted to 3.0%by June 2023, that it fell further to2.4% in September 2024, or that it was at 3.0% in Biden\u2019s last partial month in office in January 2025.\nLeavitt tried a version of this peak-versus-average comparison at the beginning of the Thursday briefing, saying that \u201cunder the painful Biden years, inflation reached a record-high 9%,\u201d while under Trump, \u201cinflation has dropped to an average of just 2.7%.\u201d Neither of those numbers is false, but Leavitt didn\u2019t point out that the record-high 9% under Biden happened in a single month about two-and-a-half years before Trump returned to office.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/11\/politics\/inflation-trump-karoline-leavitt-prices","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The secret behind your skyrocketing energy costs","date":"2025-12-04","body":"Stephanie Tate couldn\u2019t figure it out. After three years of living in her new Illinois home, her winter energy costs last year suddenly spiked to $400 per month.\nShe had three different technicians come to look at her HVAC system and furnace, but nothing was wrong with it. She had her home insulation inspected and found no issues. She installed new, energy efficient windows to stop cold air from leaking into the house.\n\u201cIt still didn\u2019t make a dent,\u201d she said.\nIn the summer, her bills were even higher, driven by the cost of the electricity needed to run her air conditioner. Tate tried to use her heat and cooling sparingly in hot and cold months.\n\u201cIn the winter, I keep my heat well below 68 \u2014 and it gets cold here, so you just bundle up,\u201d Tate said. \u201cIn the summer, my AC is at 75. I\u2019m dealing with a little warm weather inside my house.\u201d\nDiving into her bills, Tate found something surprising. Her electricity bill\u2019s delivery fees \u2014 the costs customers pay to help maintain electric infrastructure like the poles and wires carrying power to their homes \u2014 were often just as high as the cost of the electricity she used.\nWhat goes into your skyrocketing energy bills\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re paying more for everything right now, and the electrical costs \u2014 the way they increase so exponentially and so quickly is stunning to me.\u201d\nAround the country, customers like Tate are getting sticker shock when they open their monthly utility bills. Since last September, residential electricity rates nationwide increased by 7.4%, according to the federalEnergy Information Administration. Tate\u2019s home state of Illinois had the third-highest increase nationwide, with a 20.6% jump year-over-year, behind the District of Columbia and New Jersey.\nAnd electricity rates themselves \u2014 a bill\u2019s \u201csupply charges,\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t explain the total increase, because they don\u2019t include those electric infrastructure \u201cdelivery charges\u201d like Tate found.\nCost increases in Tate\u2019s area are largely about the cost of generating electricity, said a spokesperson for Ameren, the Illinois and Missouri-based utility that Tate uses. The company doesn\u2019t generate power itself in Illinois, and has to buy it from third-party suppliers, which can result in big price fluctuations during high-demand times, like summer.\nBut, like many other utilities, Ameren is also \u201cinvesting in strengthening and modernizing the grid,\u201d the spokesperson said. Increasingly, the costs of meeting those goals are showing up on utility bills around the country.\nCustomers often think of their utility bill as a measure of the energy they use to keep the lights on, and heat and cool their homes. But it\u2019s also a reflection of what their utility is building or upgrading. Across the country, the rising costs of updating aging energy infrastructure are inflating bills.\nThe nation\u2019s electricity infrastructure is old, and utilities across the country have recently been pouring money into upgrading it; in just five years, US utilities increased their spending by $5 billion on transmission (the massive high-voltage towers carrying electricity from one region to another) and another $16 billion on distribution (the smaller substations, poles and wires).\nElectric utilities are making \u201cessential investments\u201d to strengthen the grid, said Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, an electric utility trade group.\n\u201cOur electric grid is America\u2019s most important machine \u2014 and we have to make sure it works reliably every day for families, businesses, and local communities,\u201d Maloney said in a statement to CNN.\nPart of that investment is driven by new demand growth. Electricity demand in the US used to be pretty flat. Now, demand is exploding primarily from data centers, along with new manufacturing and home and vehicle electrification. Power demand from data centers alone is projected to reach 106 gigawatts in the next decade,according to a reportfrom research firm BloombergNEF.\n\u201cOver the last decade or two, we\u2019ve been able to get by with the grid that we have,\u201d said Ryan Hledik, a principal at the research and consulting firm Brattle Group and author of a recent study on electricity prices. \u201cThe unfortunate thing is, we\u2019ve been needing to make those investments to basically tread water and keep the grid as reliable as it has been in the past, at a time when the cost of that equipment has been getting more expensive.\u201d\nNew demand is coming at a pricey time for upgrades. The Covid-19 pandemic thrust global supply chains into chaos and made everything more expensive. As a result, the cost of some electrical equipment like transformers has risen faster than the rate of inflation, Hledik said.\nElectrical systems have also taken beatings from flooding, high winds and wildfires, and companies often need to invest more to try to make systems more resilient to future storms.\n\u201cThe grid is being updated, but it\u2019s definitely still old,\u201d Hledik said. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to confront the reality of more volatile weather conditions. So, it\u2019s not my expectation that the need for this investment is going to be finished\u201d anytime soon.\nIn some cities around the country, the same is true for the network of gas pipelines that deliver winter heating fuel to millions of homes. There was a customer outcry in Baltimore earlier this year as winter heating costs shot monthly bills above $1,000 for some residents.\nThose spikes related to seasonal heating needs were also driven by the cost of replacing (extremely) old equipment. Baltimore Gas and Electric operates the oldest gas system in the country and is replacing hundreds of miles of the most ancient, leakiest iron and steel pipes in the ground,CNN recently reported. One pipe scheduled for replacement this year was first installed during Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s presidency in the 1800s, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos told CNN.\n\u201cOur hundreds of miles of century-old gas main is far past the end of its useful life,\u201d Alexopulos said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to upgrade this system.\u201d\nBGE crews have already replaced around 600 miles of elderly metal pipes with new, plastic ones and have around 800 miles left to complete, Alexopulos said.\nIn Illinois, Stephanie Tate got so fed up with her electricity bills that she decided this year to take the plunge and outfit her house with solar panels and a battery storage system, which she expects to be producing power soon.\nTate said she was \u201cstunned\u201d at how expensive her home solar and battery system was, but she expects state and federal tax credits and rebates will cover half of the cost. She plans to pay off the remaining balance in a year and expects the new system will save her thousands of dollars per year on her utility bills.\n\u201cI\u2019m extraordinarily excited,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cEvery day it\u2019s sunny outside, I\u2019m like, \u2018oh gosh, I missed this day with solar. I wish it was up now so that I could reap the benefits.\u2019\u201d\nShe\u2019s looking forward to having a cooler temperature in her house this summer and also anticipating a more reliable home system that will keep her power on during severe spring storms that can knock electricity out for days.\n\u201cThose batteries will run even when Ameren is offline,\u201d Tate said.\nShe\u2019s hopeful she\u2019ll see her monthly bill reduced to a shell of its former self. However, Tate won\u2019t be completely off the grid; she\u2019ll still have to pay delivery fees to Ameren to remain connected to their system, even as she\u2019s generating and storing her own power. Nevertheless, she remains optimistic.\n\u201cI\u2019m just incredibly frustrated with the high bills,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem logical that they should be this high, this quick.\u201d\nSwitching to solar and batteries is \u201ca leap of faith,\u201d she said.\nCorrection:This story has been updated to correct the amount US utilities spent on transmission and distribution from 2019-2024.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/04\/climate\/electricity-bills-high-infrastructure-wires-demand-cost","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Consumer spending stalled in September as inflation remained stubborn","date":"2025-12-05","body":"The last piece of official inflation data to land before the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymaking meeting next week was a shutdown-delayed report that showed the pace of price hikes remained stubborn in September and consumer spending waned after a summer splurge.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures price index \u2014 the inflation gauge the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% target rate \u2014 rose 0.3% on a monthly basis, which lifted annual inflationfrom 2.7%to 2.8% in September, a rate last hit in April 2024, according to data released Friday by the Commerce Department.\nGas prices were on the high side in September, helping drive up overall inflation. Food prices also rose for the second month in a row.\nHowever, energy and food prices can be quite volatile (and influenced by one-time factors), so the Fed also closely watches the core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, as a way to gauge underlying inflation trends.\nThe core PCE index rose 0.2% from the month before, which slowed the annual rate to 2.8% from 2.9%.\nFriday\u2019s data came in largely as anticipated: Economists were expecting inflation to rise 0.2% from August and tick higher to 2.8%, according to FactSet.\nSticky, stubbornly high inflation running at a 2.8% rate is still above the Fed\u2019s 2% target; however, it remains likely that the central bank willmake another quarter-point cut at its policy meeting next week, said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet.\nBut, at this stage, the other side of the Fed\u2019s price stability and full employment mandate warrants more monetary policy attention as the labor market continues to cool, she said.\nFriday\u2019s data is \u201ccertainly not going to stop them from cutting,\u201d she said of central bank officials. \u201cI think it\u2019d be different if we saw inflation accelerating and picking up.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s report was originally scheduled for release on Halloween; however, the federal government\u2019s historic shutdown (which lasted the entirety of October and a dozen days into November), delayed the collection, tabulation and dissemination of a host of critical economic data.\nAlthough seemingly stale, Friday\u2019s data is the most comprehensive monthly report on pricing trends and how US households are earning, spending and saving.\nAmericans also reined in their purchases somewhat in September. Spending rose 0.3% that month after ticking up by 0.5% during each of the three previous months.\nWhen taking inflation into account, spending was flat in September, the lowest monthly reading since real spending dipped 0.1% in May (when car sales slumped after a spring buying frenzyfueled by tariff fears).\nThe fundamentals supporting consumer spending weakened in September as well, Friday\u2019s report showed: Inflation-adjusted disposable income rose just 0.1% for the month.\n\u201cA silent majority of consumers is increasingly strained by a two-year affordability crisis and elevated borrowing costs,\u201d Gregory Daco, EY-Parthenon\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a note on Friday. \u201cSlower income growth is pushing many upper-median, median- and lower-income families to draw down savings and rely more heavily on credit to sustain their habits.\u201d\nWhile trading down has become the norm for many households, a lot of the spending activity \u2013 particularly on services and discretionary areas \u2013 is being driven by higher-income individuals, he said, referencing what\u2019s been deemed a\u201cK-shaped economy.\u201d\nThehigher cost of living, after years of elevated inflation, continues to weigh heavily on Americans. Consumer sentiment has slumped amid the persistently high price environment as well as high levels of uncertainty related to steep tariffs and other sweeping actions from the Trump administration.\nA separate report released Friday showed that consumer sentiment in early December rose 2.3 points to a preliminary reading of 53.3, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s latest survey.\nThat was a bigger increase than economists had expected and showed that Americans saw \u201cmodest improvementsfrom Novemberon a few dimensions,\u201d Joanne Hsu, the survey\u2019s director, said in a release.\nStill, sentiment remains historically weak, near record lows, and \u201cconsumers continue to cite the burden of high prices,\u201d Hsu said.\nThe holidays and the promise of a new year tend to bolster Americans\u2019 feelings about the economy and what lies ahead, NerdWallet\u2019s Renter told CNN.\n\u201cI think people are optimistic and more willing to spend over the holidays and perhaps buck any negative sentiment they might be feeling at the time,\u201d she said.\nHowever, considering that the holidays can spur some irrational spending patterns, there does remain some concern about consumers\u2019 financial health moving forward, she said.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re just amassing credit card debt and then getting behind on their payments, spending might not be all that great for the consumer,\u201d she said.\nCNN\u2019s Bryan Mena contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/05\/economy\/us-pce-consumer-spending-inflation-september","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Polls show Trump\u2019s happy talk on inflation is falling flat","date":"2025-11-20","body":"The 2025 election two weeks ago crystallized how big a problem the economy and affordability appear to be for President Donald Trump and the Republican Party.\nTrump\u2019s initial strategy for dealing with this problem appeared to be  pretending it didn\u2019t actually exist. Trump set about falselyclaiming prices were actually down, that there is \u201calmost no inflation,\u201d and that everything was more or less hunky dory.\nItwas bizarre, even from a president who often seems to reside in his own elaborately crafted alternate reality.\nAnd it appears to be falling flat.\nNew polling conducted since Trump began driving this message shows Americans continue to see things very differently than Trump has cast them. And their reviews of his economic stewardship appear to actually be getting worse.\n\u201cOur\u202fgroceries\u202fare way down. Everything is way down,\u201d Trump said November 6. \u201cGroceries are way down, other than beef,\u201d he said at another point. He added last week that grocery prices were \u201calready at a much lower level than they were with the last administration.\u201d\nBut just 12% of Americans said grocery prices have gone down over the last six months, according to a newMarquette University Law School pollconducted November 5 through 12.\nBy contrast, 75% said they\u2019ve gone up.\n(Average grocery prices were indeedup roughly 1.4%in September compared to when  Trump took office in January, and the 0.6% jump in one month from July to August was the largest in three years.)\nEven among Republicans, only 2 in 10 subscribed to Trump\u2019s alternate version of reality in which prices are actually dropping. A majority said prices are up.\nThe numbers were similar in a Fox News poll released Thursday.\nThat poll, conducted November 14 to 17, showed 85% of registered voters  said grocery prices are higher than a year ago, with 60% saying they\u2019ve \u201cincreased a lot.\u201d\nAround two-thirds or more also said the prices of utilities, healthcare and housing were up.\n(\u201cA year ago\u201d technically includes two months in which Trump was not yet president, but it stands to reason people perceived the question as being mostly about his tenure.)\nPerhaps most striking: The percentage who say grocery prices are up \u201ca lot\u201d (60%) is significantly higher than the percentage who said that about groceries and everyday items back in October 2021 (43%). This despite inflation back then having been about double what it is today.\nThat suggests this problem is really ingrained \u2013 and will be difficult for Trump to defeat with happy talk.\nTrump has claimed there is \u201cvirtually no inflation,\u201d \u201calmost no inflation\u201d and said inflation is \u201calmost nonexistent.\u201d He has also said \u201cwe don\u2019t have any inflation.\u201d\nIn fact, inflation has remained stubborn throughout Trump\u2019s tenure and is at about 3% on an annualized basis \u2013 right where it was when he took over.\nAnd the perception might be even worse.\n52% of registered voters  said inflation was \u201cnot at all\u201d under control, according to the Fox poll. That includes nearly two-thirds of independents (65%).\nFewer than 2 in 10 overall \u2013 and only one-third of Republicans \u2013 said inflation was at least \u201cmostly\u201d under control.\nTo the extent Trump has allowed that there are economic pains, he\u2019s generally cast them as remnants of the Biden era.\n\u201cBiden was a disaster with affordability,\u201d Trump told Fox News shortly after the election. He added: \u201cWhen I took over, it was a mess.\u201d\nBut this, too, appears to be a losing argument.\nThe Fox News poll asked whether Trump or Biden were more responsible for the current economy, and voters  chose Trump, 62%-32%.\nOnly around half of Republicans (53%) blamed Biden.\nThe gamble for Trump in pitching this alternate reality is evident: If people don\u2019t ultimately subscribe to it, they might come to view Trump as out of touch and  not taking the problem seriously enough.\nAlready,CBS News-YouGov pollinghas shown 75% of Americans and a majority of Republicans have said Trump is not focused enough on lowering prices.\nAnd indeed, it seems Trump is doing himself no favors right now. If anything, his political picture on the economy and affordability is worsening:\nThe same poll shows Americans say by about a 2-to-1 margin that they expected Trump\u2019s policies will continue to increase inflation.\nIndeed, Trump has given people plenty of reason to attach whatever happens with the economy to him. That\u2019s what happens when you rock the economy with a series of unilateral global tariffs that weren\u2019t even endorsed by Republicans in Congress.\nTrump voluntarily took ownership of the economy. Now he wants to disclaim the reality of what\u2019s followed.\nPolitical analysts love to mine Trump\u2019s actions for secret political strategy and three-dimensional chess moves. But this seems more like desperation than anything else.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/20\/politics\/inflation-polls-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"An unusual trend in the economy is worrying the Fed","date":"2025-11-23","body":"Something in the US economy isn\u2019t adding up, and it\u2019s rattling the people charged with wrangling inflation and keeping the labor market intact.\nUS companies havesharply slowed their hiring this year, hesitant to invest without knowing the full effects of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping economic policies. The economy lost jobs in June and August, and the average pace of job gains for the three months ending in September was only around 62,000, according to the Labor Department.\nYet workers\u2019 productivity, a key driver of economic output, remains high. And gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy, has stayed robust.\nThat dichotomy of an expanding economy and a softening labor market presents a conundrum for policymakers at the Federal Reserve,complicating their effortsto determine whether the economy needs cooling or boosting.\n\u201cThe divergence between solid economic growth and weak job creation created a particularly challenging environment for policy decisions,\u201d Fed officials noted in their October meeting, according to minutes released Thursday.\nA growing economy, boosted by resilient consumers and massive investments in AI, should be spurring hiring, especially now that the Fed has started lowering borrowing costs. But that hasn\u2019t happened, and there are fears it won\u2019t.\n\u201cWhen it comes to monetary policy, the narrative next year is going to be about how to handle a jobless expansion,\u201d Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, told CNN. \u201cHow do you try to get businesses to hire more?\u201d\nThe recent string ofrecord highsin the stock market suggests that many American businesses are optimistic about the value of AI. However, that confidence has so far not translated into an expansion of their workforce.\nBusiness spending on information processing equipment and software accounted for 4.4% of GDP in the second quarter, according to Commerce Department data, slightly below a peak reached in 2000 when businesses ramped up similar investments during the dot-com boom. Solid consumer spending this year has also kept company profits afloat.\nUS adds jobs, but unemployment hits 4-year high\n\u201cFirms are investing a lot in this new technology, but sometimes that means reducing other expenditures, such as hiring,\u201d said Eugenio Alem\u00e1n, chief economist at Raymond James. He added that strong AI investment likely persisted in the third quarter and should peak sometime next year.\nThe government shutdown likely dented GDP in the current quarter that stretches from October through December, but the US economy is widely expected to recoup most of those losses early next year.\nMeanwhile, the US labor market has been stymied by Trump\u2019s significant policy changes since the beginning of the year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a challenging year for employment precisely because of the changes in trade and immigration policy affecting both labor supply and demand,\u201d said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at DA Davidson.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether rate cuts can eventually counteract the corrosive effects of major policy changes that have stoked uncertainty to bolster hiring, economists say.\n\u201cFortunately, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of layoffs, because that\u2019s how you turn a jobless expansion into a recession,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cThe economy can grow without creating a lot of jobs, but productivity growth has to be decent.\u201d\nFed officials are expected to deliver a few more rate cuts through 2026, according to their latest economic projections from September.\nA jobless expansion could quickly translate into a recession.\n\u201cYou\u2019re very vulnerable to anything that goes wrong,\u201d Sweet said. \u201cThe labor market is your line of defense, and if that starts to fray, then it\u2019s game over.\u201d\nIt also raises the risk the Fed commits a policy mistake.\nIn a speech last month, Fed Governor Christopher Waller described the divergence between GDP and job growth as a \u201cconflict\u201d that should work itself out \u2014 for better or worse.\nWait, I thought the economy was terrible. What happened?\n\u201cSomething\u2019s gotta give \u2014 either economic growth softens to match a soft labor market, or the labor market rebounds to match stronger economic growth,\u201d he said.\nAnd if job growth remains inconsistent with GDP, that puts the US economy in a precarious position.\nPersistently strong economic growth also makes Fed officials less confident that they should be lowering interest rates, and there\u2019s already plenty of hesitance to continue with rate cuts within the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee.\n\u201cWith two rate cuts now in place, I\u2019d find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly,\u201d Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said Friday at an event in Zurich, adding that there are signs that \u201cpolicy most likely isn\u2019t very restrictive.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/23\/economy\/jobless-boom-ai-federal-reserve","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Affordability is in crisis. The solution: You\u2019ll never own anything again","date":"2025-11-12","body":"Stubborn inflationcontinues to make the cost of living unbearable for many Americans. A number of inventive solutions have emerged \u2014 but with a common theme: putting consumers deeper into debt.\nThis week\u2019s50-year mortgage proposalfrom the Trump administration is the latest example of the trend. Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, remarked over the weekend on X that President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal would be \u201ca complete game changer.\u201d\nFor many Americans, though, it may not be a good one.\nThe potential for a 50-year mortgage comes as the auto industry has been pushing seven-year car loans, which have become an increasingly popular option with theaverage price of a new carhitting a new record of more than $50,000. And the explosion of buy now, pay later options online and at brick-and-mortar retailers hasnormalizedtaking on longer-term debt for purchases as small as food delivery.\nThese offerings can help ease financial anxiety in the immediate future, but they can also do significant damage to a consumer\u2019s financial stability over the long haul.\nCase in point: While a 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments, the amount of interest a borrower would pay over 50 years could be double what would be paid at current rates over 30 years, the traditional length of most mortgages.\nThat\u2019s assuming the borrower even survives the entire 50 years. With average American life expectancy at around 80 years old, most Americans would have to get a mortgage by the time they\u2019re 30 to have a shot \u2013 albeit a slim one \u2013 at reaping the benefits of homeownership.\n\u201cGenerally speaking, the more you can avoid longer-than-usual loan terms, the better,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. \u201cCars tend to lose value rapidly when you drive them off the lot, so with a longer-term loan, you run the risk of owing more on the car than it is worth. That\u2019s not a good situation for anyone.\u201d\nBuy now, pay later (BNPL), an increasingly popular option for delaying payment, allows many Americans to own more goods by giving them an instant stream of funds to tap into. But, increasingly, consumers \u2014 especially younger ones \u2014 are making purchases they otherwise may not have been able to afford, as evidenced by the recent uptick in late payments.\nA Federal Reserve study published last year on BNPL users reported that \u201cadults who report lower overall financial well-being and those who appear liquidity or credit constrained were not only among the most likely to use BNPL, but most of these consumers also indicated that they used BNPL because it was the only way they could afford to make the purchases.\u201d\nAll major forms of consumer debt, including mortgages, auto loans and student loans, are at record highs, according to a report last week from the New York Fed, which has been tracking household debt since 2003. In total, Americans are shouldering $18.6 trillion in debt, a 3.6% uptick from a year ago. Within that, credit card debt has risen nearly 6% from a year ago to a record $1.2 trillion, the New York Fed reported last week.\nMeanwhile, the rate of consumers who entered serious delinquency \u2014 meaning they\u2019re at least 90 days late in making a debt payment \u2014 rose to more than 3% in the third quarter of this year. That\u2019s the highest level in over a decade, according to New York Fed data.\nThe stress is most prominent for student loan payments, of which more than 14% became seriously delinquent last quarter, the highest level recorded dating back to when the regional reserve bank began tracking it in 2004.\nIt\u2019s having a worrying effect on Americans\u2019 finances:Credit scores fellby the most this year since the Great Recession. As an individual\u2019s credit score declines, it generally becomes more expensive to finance any existing or new debt because lenders view the borrower as a greater risk. To compensate for that, they charge higher interest.\nAn intrinsic part of the American dream has long been owning a home, and it\u2019s for good reason.\nWhile renting has its advantages, the major upside of ownership is that over time property values tend to appreciate, which generates a stream of wealth that can be tapped into later in life, making it possible for people to retire.\nNot to mention, there are also tax advantages to owning a home, such as the ability to deduct mortgage interest payments to lower your overall tax burden. No such equivalent exists for rent payments.\n\u201cHomeownership has been one of the most accessible ways for the average person to build wealth,\u201d Schulz said.

{"title":"Fact check: Trump\u2019s lying spree about inflation","date":"2025-11-10","body":"President Donald Trump went on a lying spree about inflation last week.\nGrocery prices. Gas prices. Prescription drug prices. Overall prices. Over just three days, Trump made false claims about all of them.\nTrump was discussing the issue of \u201caffordability\u201d after Democrats won state and local elections Tuesday in part bycampaigning on the cost of living. Hearguedthat this theme was \u201ca con job by the Democrats\u201d given how successful he said he has been in lowering prices.\nBut Trump repeatedly used inaccurate statistics and assertions to make his case that Democrats were dishonest. Here is a fact check.\nOver and over, Trump claimed overall prices have fallen since he returned to office in late January.\n\u201cEvery price is down,\u201d hesaidThursday. \u201cEverything is way down,\u201d hesaidat another Thursday event. \u201cPrices are down under the Trump administration, and they\u2019re down substantially,\u201d hesaidFriday, adding, \u201cEverybody knows that it\u2019s far less expensive under Trump than it was under Sleepy Joe Biden. And the prices are way down.\u201d\nNone of that is true.\nPrices are up during this administration. Average prices were 1.7% higher in September than they were in January, according to the most recentfigures from the federal Consumer Price Index, and 3% higher than they were in September 2024. Therehas been inflationevery month of the term, andfar more productshave gotten costlier than cheaper.\nTrumpclaimedFriday: \u201cWe have almost no inflation. We\u2019re down now to 2%.\u201d He said at the same event: \u201cInflation is almost nonexistent.\u201d\nThose claims are slightly more accurate than Trump\u2019s late-Octoberclaimsthat \u201cwe don\u2019t have any inflation\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re down to 2%, even less than 2%.\u201d But the new claims are still wrong.\nInflation not only very much continues to exist but has been accelerating since the spring. As of September, the year-over-year inflation rate hadincreased for five consecutive months.\nThe September rate, 3%, was the same as the rate in January, the month Trump returned to the White House. Inflation of 3% is simply not inflation of 2%. (Core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy prices,was also 3% in September.) And this \u201c2%\u201d claim wasn\u2019t a one-time slip by Trump; heclaimedin late October, \u201cWe\u2019re down to 2%, even less than 2%.\u201d\nTrump claimed on bothWednesdayandThursdaythat \u201cgroceries are way down.\u201d Butgrocery prices are actually up. Average grocery prices rose 1.4% between January and September, Consumer Price Indexfigures show, and they rose 2.7% between September 2024 and September 2025. The 0.6% increase in average grocery prices from July 2025 to August 2025, meanwhile, was the biggest month-to-month spike in three years \u2013 and it was followed by a 0.3% increase from August to September.\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that beef is the only grocery product whose price has increased this term. \u201cGroceries are way down, other than beef,\u201d heclaimedWednesday. \u201cWe have much lower prices than (Democrats) do, and we only have one thing, beef,\u201d heclaimedThursday.\nThis is also false. The prices of dozens of individual grocery products increased from January to September. A smattering of products got less expensive over that period, most notablyeggs, but a far greater number of products got more expensive; you can see a listhere. Prices increased from January to September in five of the six overarching groups of grocery prices tracked by the Consumer Price Index.\nTrump continued to usemathematically impossible figureswhen making claims about how much he is supposedly reducing prescription drug prices. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing drug prices down to levels nobody ever thought was possible, tremendous cuts, 200%, 300%, 500%, 700%,\u201d heclaimedThursday, adding later, \u201cnow we\u2019re cutting it 1,000%, 1,200%.\u201d\nTrump has had some success in pushing drug companies to cut the prices of some medications; he made these comments at an event announcingreductionsin the prices of certain blockbuster obesity drugs. But far more medications have not had their prices slashed \u2013 and regardless, Trump\u2019s professed reductions in excess of 100% make no sense even if he is talking about a small number of specific drugs. A price reduction of 100% would make a drug cost $0, so a reduction of 200% or more would mean Americans would be getting paid a substantial amount of money to acquire medications. That is not happening.\nTrump has been making false claims about gas pricesformonths. HeclaimedWednesday: \u201cGasoline prices have plummeted to the lowest in two decades.\u201d That wasnot even close to truegiven that the national average on Wednesday was $3.08, according to data provided by AAA \u2013 higher than it was on various days under Biden in January of thisyear, as well as during2020andearly 2021(amid the Covid-19 pandemic) and duringmuch of the 2000s and 2010s. \u201cPlummeted\u201d is also a stretch given that the AAA national average was $3.12 per gallon on the day Trump returned to office in January and $3.10 per gallon one year before Wednesday, both just barely higher than Wednesday\u2019s $3.08 per gallon.\nIt\u2019s possible Trump was attempting to refer to the federal Energy Information Administration\u2019sestimatein September that drivers will this year spend \u201cthe smallest share of their disposable income on gasoline since 2005.\u201d But that\u2019s an estimate, not a certainty, and it\u2019s simply not the same thing as Trump said about gas prices alone; \u201cthere\u2019s a big difference between \u2018lowest gas prices in 20 years\u2019 and \u2018least amount of your paycheck going to fill your tank in 20 years,\u2019\u201dPatrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, noted to CNN. It\u2019s not necessarilyyourpaycheck, either. The federal estimate is based onoveralldisposable income in the economy, so some Americans have less than the estimate while others have more.\nTrump also made other false claims about gas prices last week. On Thursday, Trumpclaimed, \u201cWe\u2019re at almost $2 for gasoline.\u201d On Friday, heclaimed, \u201cWe\u2019re a little bit above $2 right now for gasoline.\u201d Even granting Trump some wiggle room for the words \u201calmost\u201d and \u201ca little bit,\u201d there is no reasonable argument that a national average above $3 per gallon is \u201calmost $2\u201d or \u201ca little bit above $2.\u201d (De Haan said GasBuddy found one gas station, out of the tens of thousands of stations the company tracks, that sold gas for under $2 per gallon last week \u2013 and even that station only did so for a single day.)\nTrump, echoing a claim he hasmadefor months,saidWednesday that Biden \u201chad the highest inflation rate in the history of our country.\u201d TrumpsaidFriday: \u201cWe took over a mess. The highest inflation in recorded history.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t the highest in history, as CNN and others have noted in numerous articles. Trump could have fairly said the inflation ratehit a 40-year high under Biden in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to theall-time\u202frecord\u202fof 23.7%, set in 1920 \u2013 and Trump didn\u2019t mention that it had declined to 3% by Biden\u2019s last partial month in office in January, the same as the most recent Trump-era figure for September.\nTrump\u2019s claim was also incorrect if he meant the Biden presidency set a record for cumulative inflation over the course of a presidential term; the Biden-era increase was much smaller than the increase during President Jimmy Carter\u2019s term.\nTrumpclaimedFriday: \u201cEnergy prices are way down from what they were last year.\u201d\nBut the Consumer Price Index shows thathousehold energy pricesare up substantially over the last year \u2013 6.2% higher in September 2025 than they were in September 2024.\nIt\u2019s possible Trump was not meaning to refer to household energy. A review of his recent comments suggests he often uses \u201cenergy\u201d to describe eithergas prices at the pumps, which have fallen a little over the past year, oroil prices on world markets, which have fallenmore substantially.\nSo we won\u2019t label this Trump claim false given that he could have been talking about the price of a barrel of oil. But when he doesn\u2019t define the term \u201cenergy,\u201d and speaks about it while discussing consumer prices, he leaves his assertion open to a possible misinterpretation.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/10\/politics\/inflation-trump-fact-check","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

That\u2019s higher than normal but not out of control","date":"2025-10-24","body":"The cost of living got even more expensive for Americans last month, with prices rising at the fastest pace since the start of the year.\nConsumer prices rose 0.3% in September, which drove the annual rate of inflation from 2.9% to 3%, the highest it\u2019s been since January, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday.\nGas prices, which shot up 4.1% overall and 4.2% for regular unleaded fuel (both the largest monthly increases since August 2023), were the biggest culprit behind the monthly increase, BLS data shows.\nFood prices rose at a more moderate pace than they did in August (a month when grocery prices leapt by the highest rate in nearly three years). And housing-related inflation also continued its lengthy slowdown.\nEconomists were expecting that inflation would continue to pick up speed, rising 0.4% for the month and 3.1% from the year before, according to FactSet estimates.\nExcluding food and energy, which can be quite volatile, the core measure of CPI rose 0.2% in September, with an annual inflation rate settling out at 3%.\nAlthough better than economists had expected, Friday\u2019s inflation data is a disconcerting reminder that prices are still rising faster than they typically should.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a psychological milestone of being back at that 3% level again,\u201d Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an interview with CNN.\nDue to inflation, the typical American household is spending $208 more a month in September to purchase the same goods and services as they were a year ago, and $1,043 more a month than they did at the start of 2021, coming out of the pandemic, new data from Moody\u2019s Analytics showed.\nThe softer inflation reading for September gives a green light to a rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which has a policy meeting next week, wrote Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds.\nHowever, Rupkey cautioned that the better-than-expected report might also be painting a rosier picture than actually exists.\n\u201cThe immediate dangers from Trump 2.0 tariff policies have not yet fed through to inflation overall,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors Friday. \u201cThe market will likely hold their applause, however, as one reason inflation is held in check may be due to the economic slowdown seen in many labor market indicators.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s report provided further evidence that President Donald Trump\u2019s steep import tariffs are causing certain goods prices to move higher. Categories such as apparel, home furnishings, footwear and appliances all continued to see price increases last month, and a closely watched inflation index (core goods excluding autos) is up 1.3% annually, which is the highest since August 2023.\nHowever, the September report issomewhat unique in its own right: It\u2019s the first major federal economic report released since the US government shut down on October 1.\nSeptember CPI, which was originally scheduled for release on October 15, is being belatedly published so that the government can meet deadlines to make cost of living adjustments for 2026 Social Security payments.\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/24\/economy\/us-cpi-consumer-prices-inflation-september","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"A tiny light in an economic data blackout is about to shine through the shutdown for a brief moment","date":"2025-10-23","body":"Nearly two dozen days have passed since a federal agencyhas published an economic report. The US government\u2019s shutdown has resulted in a blackout of critical data,further cloudingan already opaque economic outlook.\nThat will change \u2013 albeit briefly \u2013 Friday morning, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to release the Consumer Price Index report for September.\nThe September CPI will allow the data-hungry to get a little fix, providing a snapshot of how prices are trending for Americans.\nThe report is a one-off of sorts:BLS staff were called back into the officethis monthto allow the government to meet statutory requirements in adjusting Social Security payments for next year. The September CPI is the final piece of data needed for the 2026 cost of living adjustment.\nSo, after the CPI is released, darkness once again will envelop federal economic data until the government reopens.\n(And as for the report itself, economists tell CNN that despite the circumstances behind the delayed release, they\u2019re not concerned about the integrity of the underlying data.)\nEconomists expect the latest data to showthat prices for a slew of commonly purchased goods and services rose at a faster-than-typical clip (0.4%) last month. This would lift the annual rate of inflation from 2.9% to 3.1% \u2013 the fastest pace in more than a year.\nThere are many factors behind the upswing, including: pricier gas, food and tariff-impacted goods as well as slower-than-anticipated reduction in inflation on the services side \u2013 notably housing.\nIt\u2019s helpful to remember that the last time inflation was below 2% was in February 2021, Michael Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN in an interview.\n\u201cAt the macro level, it\u2019s a reminder of how sticky inflation can be when it gets out of the tube and how hard it is to get to back to that 2% once it\u2019s been above target for a while,\u201d he said.\nAmerican consumers have weathered nearly five years of prices rising faster than they typically should (and prices rose far, far faster than usual for two of those years). However, years of high inflation have taken their toll.\nFood prices, for example, have risen 24% between 2020 and 2024, noted Billy Roberts, senior analyst for food and beverage at CoBank, which provides financial services to agribusinesses and rural firms.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen smaller degrees of inflation, even over the course of this year, but it\u2019s really that cumulative effect,\u201d he said.\nIn August,grocery prices jumped 0.6%, the highest monthly increase in nearly three years, according to BLS data. Economists expect the September gain to be more mellow; however, certain categories likely will highlight pain points.\nBeef prices, for example,have risen dramaticallyin recent years as herds have shrunk amidprolonged drought.Cocoaandcoffee prices, which have been pushed higher byclimate changestifling supply, nowface further pressures from tariffs.\nConsumers stocking up for trick-or-treaters are now seeing the effects, Roberts said, noting cocoa prices are \u201cstill about double, if not triple, what they were in 2022-\u201923.\u201d\n\u201cThose aren\u2019t items that consumers necessarily buy week in and week out,\u201d but they\u2019re buying in bulk now for Halloween, he said. \u201cThose prices are going to provide a lot of sticker shock for consumers.\u201d\nFood prices remain a sore spot for many Americansas do electricity prices, which also have been on the rise, Joe Brusuelas, RSM chief economist, told CNN.\nIn addition to those categories, Brusuelas noted he\u2019ll be monitoring services-related inflation \u2014 such as airfare and other discretionary areas \u2014 and whether it\u2019s remaining stubbornly high.\nThe Fed just cut rates. But relief might not come quickly enough for some Americans\n\u201cWhat I am concerned about is the sticky and stubborn service sector costs along with rising food and utility prices, which are really placing stress on middle-class and down-market households,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is a function of that greater discussion around the K-shaped economy, where 40% of this country is thriving.\u201d\nA recent analysis by Moody\u2019s Analytics found that the country\u2019s top-earners (who have benefited from a surging stock market, rising wages and increased housing wealth)are accounting for an even greater share of overall spending.\n\u201cDown market,\u201d Brusuelas added, \u201cit\u2019s a very different reality.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/23\/economy\/us-cpi-september-inflation-preview","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Job growth in recent months has been anemic, people are staying unemployed for longer, and there are now more unemployed people seeking work than there are job openings.\nTo make matters more complicated, the shutdown of the federal government has suspended the release of most official economic data, which the Fed relies on to understand the economy.\nPowell said the Fed looks at \u201ca wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available\u201d and that \u201cwe also maintain a nationwide network of contacts through the Reserve Banks who provide valuable insights\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBased on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago,\u201d he added.\nFed officials lowered borrowing costsfor the first time this year in September, when they also warned about the risks to both inflation and jobs.\n\u201cIf we move too quickly (with lowering rates), then we may leave the inflation job unfinished and have to come back later and finish it,\u201d Powell said during the event. \u201cIf we move too slowly, there may be unnecessary losses, painful losses, in the employment market.\u201d\nFed officials themselves are debating how best to steer the economy.\nFed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller \u2014 both Trump appointees \u2014 cast dissenting votes in July, backing a rate cut instead of holding steady. It was the first time more than one Fed governor dissented on a policy decision since the 1993.\nIn September, Fed Governor Stephen Miran, a close Trump ally who was sworn in an hour before the latest Fed interest-rate meeting, wanted to lower rates by half a point instead of a quarter point.\n\u201cWe have a healthy debate going,\u201d Powell said Tuesday.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/14\/business\/powell-fed-inflation-jobs-tension","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Only one employee was assigned to continue working full-time at the bureau throughout the shutdown, according to contingency plans released by the US Department of Labor, which oversees the bureau.

{"title":"Wholesale inflation cooled in August as businesses absorb tariff costs \u2014 for now","date":"2025-09-10","body":"US inflation cooled off at the wholesale level in August, bolstering hopes that high tariffs aren\u2019t yet causing prices to spiral out of control, fresh data showed Wednesday.\nHowever, economists caution, the better-than-expected reading could be a sign of a slowing economy and that shrinking businesses\u2019 margins could foretell higher prices for consumers in the near future.\nProducer prices unexpectedly fell 0.1% in August, cooling annual inflation to 2.6% from adownwardly revised 3.1% in July, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nHelping to drive prices lower was a 1.7% drop in trade services, a category reflective of changes in retailers and wholesalers\u2019 gross profit margins.\nIf margins are shrinking, it could be an indication that businesses are using those to eat higher costs \u2014 such as those from steep tariffs \u2014 and ultimately pass more of those costs to consumers or make cutbacks elsewhere, economists have said.\nThe trade services category can be highly volatile; however, August\u2019s estimated drop is the biggest monthly decline in more than a year. (PPI data is revised the following month as more comprehensive information becomes available from businesses).\nWhen excluding highly volatile components like trade services, as well as food and energy, the underlying inflation trend appears less rosy: Prices rose 0.3% from July and ticked up to 2.8% for the 12 months ended in August.\nStill, Wednesday\u2019s report painted a picture of inflation not drastically escalating at the wholesale level at a time when President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have settled in more firmly. The softer wholesale inflation dynamic bolstered investors\u2019 expectations that the Federal Reserve will follow through cutting interest rates later this month.\n\u201cThe tariff effect is not boosting across-the-board price pressures yet,\u201d Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote Wednesday in a note. \u201cEconomists will still caution markets that core producer goods prices are rising significantly at the producer level, so the country is not out of the woods from the inflation threat.\u201d\n\u201cBut the warnings are falling on deaf ears as far as investors are concerned. As time goes on, one has to wonder if there are slow-growth reasons and weak economic demand that is keeping inflation in check,\u201d he added.\nStocks were mixed. The Dow fell 65 points, or 0.14%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each gained 0.4%. Treasury yields fell.\nEconomists were expecting that the overall PPI, which measures the change in prices received by producers of goods and services, would increase by 0.4% on a monthly basis and hold unchanged at the previously estimated 3.3% from a year ago, according to FactSet estimates.\nEconomists expected that a core measurement of PPI that excludes food and energy would slightly increase on an annual basis. Wednesday\u2019s report showed that core PPI excluding food and energy (but still including trade services) fell 0.1% and slowed to 2.8%.\nWholesale consumer durable goods prices increased by 0.3% for the third consecutive month, a likely indication of tariff-related effects.\nPPI serves as a potential bellwether for the prices consumers may see in the months ahead.\n\u201cProducer prices for goods continue to rise steadily in response to the tariffs,\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote Wednesday. \u201cCommodity prices, however, are flat, shipping costs have returned to their lowest levels since their post-pandemic surge, and the dollar has held its value against other currencies since June. So core goods PPI inflation should ease after producers have finished passing on tariff costs in a few months\u2019 time.\u201d\nAnd for American consumers, prices have been rising faster than normal in recent months as more businesses have started to pass along the costs from steep import tariffs. Sharply rising goods prices have put upward pressure on overall inflation.\nTo what extent that trend continued in August will be much clearer on Thursday, when the BLS releases the latest Consumer Price Index data.\nThe most widely used inflation gauge is expected to show that prices rose 0.3% in August, a faster monthly pace than the 0.2% rate in July and that annual inflation would likely rise to 2.9%, its highest since January.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/10\/economy\/us-producer-price-index-ppi-august","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The Fed still hasn\u2019t defeated high inflation. Has it failed?","date":"2025-10-09","body":"The Federal Reserve stepped in last month to safeguard America\u2019s labor market, cutting rates by a quarter point to shore up a slowdown in hiring. But it has another equally important problem still to address \u2014 one that has driven up the cost of living in the United States and continues to strain lower- and middle-income households.\nInflation \u2014 the other side of the Fed\u2019s dual mandate \u2014 still hasn\u2019t returned to pre-pandemic levels and President Donald Trump\u2019s trade warhas already pushed up some prices.The Fed came within a hair of its 2% target by the end of last year, but then Trump\u2019s aggressive policies shifted the tectonic plates of the economy.\nIt\u2019s a thorny issue that has divided policymakers on the rate-setting committee: The central bankers who called for rate cuts beginning in July \u2014 all Trump appointees \u2014 say they\u2019re hopeful that tariff inflation will be temporary. Other Fed officials, however, aren\u2019t convinced.\n\u201cWe have been missing our mandate on the inflation side, our objective of 2%, for more than four and a half years,\u201d Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack told CNBC on September 29. \u201cI continue to be worried about where we are from an inflation perspective.\u201d\nThe central bank has held interest rates steady for nine months straight in order to gauge the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on the economy. But with the labor market now also under some duress, the economic picture has become far more complex.\n\u201cThere are no risk-free paths now,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters at a September press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s not incredibly obvious what to do.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to keep our eye on inflation. At the same time, we cannot ignore and must keep our eye on maximum employment. Those are our two equal goals,\u201d he added.\nThe Fed received broad criticism for being too late to respond to inflation\u2019s eruption in 2021 \u2014 a view that some Fed officials, including Powell, have acknowledged. But by mid-2022, Fed officials were correcting course, hiking rates at the fastest pace since the 1980s. And it worked.\nBy the end of last year, the Fed was on track to pull off the elusive \u201csoft landing\u201d by taming inflation without a recession. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, continued to slow in the first half of 2025, reaching a four-year low of 2.3% in April.\nThen, in January, Trump began his second term. His erratic trade war has paralyzed businesses, putting hiring plans on hold. It\u2019s also roiled price pressures in the economy. That\u2019s on top of other massive policy shifts, such as mass deportations and cuts to federal funding.\n\u201cThe economy is in a tug of war,\u201d Philip Straehl, chief investment officer, Americas, at Morningstar Wealth, told CNN.\n\u201cThe Fed is making a tradeoff for the labor market because the tariff uncertainty is weighing on companies, you see what\u2019s happening with federal workers and the impact of AI on certain industries,\u201d he said.\nThe Fed is expected to lower borrowing costs two more times by the end of the year, according to Fed officials\u2019 latest economic projections, in the hopes that this will help prevent unemployment from surging. Reduced interest rates could also help the many Americans still struggling with the higher cost of living.\nJob growth since the summerhas been tepid; unemployment among young people and minorities has climbed sharply; and there are nowmore unemployed people seeking workthan there are job openings, according to the latest Labor Department data.\nUnemployment remains relatively low, at 4.3%, but research shows that whenever joblessness rises, it typically continues to do so \u2014 unless the Fed steps in. To put that into context, a 0.1% change in the unemployment rate equals hundreds of thousands of people.\nTo make matters more complicated, the government\u2019s shutdown means the suspension of official economic data that provides critical guidance for policymakers on issues like employment, inflation and trade. The September jobs report, due out October 3, has already been delayed and key inflation data due out next week could also be postponed. That puts a blindfold on the Fed.\nFor now, officials are still widely expected to lower rates by a quarter point at their October 28-29 policy meeting, according to futures.\nMeanwhile, Americans are stuck waiting for the economy to right itself after years of high inflation. In August, price hikes were up by about 20% compared to January 2021, according to the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.\nThat has resulted in many low-income households cutting back, or trading down for cheaper alternatives, according to retailers. Credit scores are alsofalling at the fastest pace since the Great Recessionwith the return of student debt payments.\nAnd the US economy is starting to bifurcate: Executives at major companies such as Walmart, McDonald\u2019s and Target regularly detail in earnings calls the ongoing economic plight of low- and middle-income Americans. The University of Michigan\u2019slatest consumer surveynoted that \u201csentiment for consumers with larger stock holdings held steady in September, while for those with smaller or no holdings, sentiment decreased.\u201d\n\u201cThere is this big dichotomy between higher-income and lower-income consumers which continues and is a real issue,\u201d Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf told CNBC on September 10.\n\u201cThe low end is spending the money that they have, so their balances are below \u2026 pre-pandemic levels; they are living on the edge,\u201d he said.\nAmericans are also still facing a housing crisis of low supply, high prices and elevated mortgage rates. Trump has said the Fed needs to lower interest rates in order to bring about better affordability for home seekers and has tried to influence the politically independent Fed in order to extract reduced borrowing costs.\nTrump said he would fire Powell (and then said he would not), has ousted Fed Governor Lisa Cook (although she launched an immediate legal challenge andremains in her position) and has pressured members of the Board to resign. He even had his top economic adviser take a leave of absence in order tofill a vacant sloton the Fed\u2019s powerful governing Board.\nTrump has also said he intends toname a new Fed chairthis year, months before Powell\u2019s term ends in May, an unusual step that effectively introduces a \u201cshadow\u201d leader at the central bank, diluting Powell\u2019s power as consensus builder. At least two voting members of the rate-setting committee are under contention for the role, and have spoken out in favor of aggressive rate cuts.\nThat all leaves the central bank facing a battle on multiple fronts: Protecting its independence while preventing both inflation and unemployment from surging in the year ahead amid continued economic uncertainty (and a data blackout).\n\u201cThere is not a generic playbook for how the central bank should respond to a stagflationary shock,\u201d Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said at an event in New York in April.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/09\/economy\/has-the-fed-defeated-inflation","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Amid tensions with US, high inflation is back on Venezuela\u2019s streets","date":"2025-11-11","body":"As Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro faces growing USmilitary pressureand calls for his resignation, an old foe is returning to haunt him in his own backyard: Inflation, one of Venezuela\u2019s chronic economic maladies, is on the rise again.\n\u201cPrices are growing every day,\u201d said Yon Michael Hernandez, 25, a motorcycle taxi driver in the slum of Petare, east of Caracas.\n\u201cCorn flour is 220 bolivars today, it may be 240 tomorrow and 260 the day after, and the same package that might have cost you one dollar 15 days ago is worth three now,\u201d Hernandez told CNN. He referred to the Venezuelan currency and to the pre-cooked flour used to makearepas,the ubiquitous corn pancakes that are a daily staple.\nIn the three months since the Pentagon deployed warships and aircraft in a campaign that the White House said was aimed at drug traffickers from Venezuela, the bolivar has depreciated around 70% against the US dollar, according to data from the central bank, hemorrhaging one point every day.\nIn the illegal but widely used currency black market, the drop has been just as steep. At the official rate, the US dollar is pegged at about 231 Venezuelan bolivars. On the black market, a dollar is worth roughly a third more. The Venezuelan government prohibits publishing black market exchange rates.\nThe surge in inflation is linked \u2013 although only partially \u2013 with the growing tensions between the Trump administration and the Maduro government, which has been under US Treasury Department sanctions for almost a decade.\nVenezuela urges residents to report neighbors with app\nMaduro has accused the United States of seeking to oust him after more than 12 years in power and one year after he controversially claimed to win a presidential election that many international observers accused him of stealing.\nWhile a military attack on Venezuelan soil may not materialize, the economic outlook is firmly in the red once again, after a change of policies gave the country a much-needed boost in the years immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOnly last year, Maduro boasted about the results of those reforms, claiming his country\u2019s GDP was growing at 8% and that inflation was at the lowest rate in four decades. The autocratic leader no longer makes such claims.\nAccording to the United Nations, Venezuela historically does not produce enough food to meet its needs, and many products must be imported from abroad and paid for in foreign currencies.\nThis also means the market is particularly exposed when the bolivar loses value.\nFor many Venezuelans, still reeling from years of hyper-inflation before the pandemic lockdowns, the new price hikes revive a familiar nightmare.\n\u201cNot many people are purchasing these days. Those who can try to buy as little as possible,\u201d said Marjorie Yanez, 40, a street-food seller in Caracas. \u201cDollars get more expensive every day, and that is bad for retailers like us because we also must raise our prices every day.\u201d\nA typical breakfast of croissant andcaf\u00e9 con lechenow can easily cost the equivalent of $8 to $10 at a bakery in Caracas, while the country\u2019s official minimum wage is less than a dollar a month.\nThe stream of remittances from relatives abroad, a consequence of more than 7 million Venezuelans fleeing the country under Maduro to look for better opportunities elsewhere, is also falling short.\n\u201cI had to increase how much I send back to my parents every month, but even with that, it\u2019s not enough. They can barely make ends meet,\u201d said Diego Mejias, 35, an architect in neighboring Colombia who provides for his parents in Caracas.\nThe central bank stopped publishing inflation reports in October last year, when the country had managed to keep the rate at single digits for 20 straight months.\nShortly afterward, things began to unravel.\nIn July, Venezuelan security forces briefly detained several economists, including former finance minister Rodrigo Cabezas, for sharing pessimistic views. The interior minister called their comments destabilizing. Critics denounced the arrests as baseless.\nThe economists were later released, but publishing economic figures remains taboo.\nFor many Venezuelans, economic fears trump concerns of US military action\nFor this report, CNN spoke with two private consultants who have access to reliable economic data. Both spoke anonymously for fear of government retaliation.\nCNN has also contacted Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who is in charge of Venezuela\u2019s finances, and is waiting for a response.\nBoth consultants estimated that inflation in Caracas is currently running between 20% and 30% a month and is destined to keep rising as long as the bolivar depreciation continues.\nPrices are slightly cheaper outside the capital in regions such as Tachira or Zulia, closer to the Colombian border, where many imported products cross into Venezuela.\nFaced with the economic malaise, the government has cracked down on the black market for US dollars. In June, Attorney General Tarek William Saab announced the detention of 58 people on charges of \u201cmanipulating exchange rates.\u201d Authorities also seized a dozen web pages advertising the sale of dollars and euros at rates different from the official one by the central bank.\nThe moves have done little to stop the bolivar\u2019s fall.\nLast month, the International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela\u2019s annual inflation at about 270%, the highest in the world and a sharp increase from the 180% rate it estimated in April.\nFor 2026, the outlook is even bleaker. The IMF forecasts Venezuela\u2019s inflation to top 600% by next October.\nThe bolivar\u2019s plunge can be partially explained by the US military\u2019s show of force, as nervous Venezuelans seek to purchase hard currency as a hedge against an uncertain future. But that is only one of the causes, the consultants told CNN.\nUS sanctions against the Venezuelan oil sector, which is the nation\u2019s largest source of foreign exchange by far, are also partially to blame.\nIn July, the Trump administration renegotiated a license authorizing Chevron, a major US oil company, to export Venezuelan crude. Under the new terms of the license, Chevron was authorized to pay fees and royalties to Venezuela in oil but not in cash, effectively reducing Chevron\u2019s crude exports from the country by half, according to Reuters.\nA spokesperson for Chevron said the company \u201coperates globally in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to its business, as well as the sanctions frameworks provided for by the US government, including in Venezuela.\u201d\nThe change has proved costly because Venezuela lost one of its few remaining sources of legitimate income. As a result, the government is now forced to sell even more oil on the black market at a discount to evade US government sanctions, one of the economists in Caracas told CNN.\nTo make up for the missing income, the government recently allowed private companies to sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for the depreciated bolivar, with exchange houses openly supported by a new crypto-managing regulator, the National Superintendence of Crypto Assets, known as Sunacrip.\nLast year, Reuters reported that the government was preparing to increase usage of crypto assets in its oil exports to overcome the US sanctions. According to the specialized data collector Chainanalysis, Venezuela is second only to Brazil for crypto adoption rates in Latin America.\nToday, thousands of Venezuelans \u2013 from corporate bankers to retirees \u2013 regularly purchase US dollars on Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. It is even common to see shoppers at grocery stores trading currencies in the checkout lines.\nNot everyone has embraced the new normal. \u201cSending money to Venezuela has always been a mess,\u201d said Mejias, the architect in Colombia. \u201cNow it\u2019s even more confusing to understand what rate is good and what is not, and for old people like my parents, even more.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/11\/americas\/venezuela-inflation-us-tension-intl-latam","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"Why inflation\u2019s got you down, even if it\u2019s not really happening (yet)","date":"2025-08-15","body":"EDITOR\u2019S NOTE:A version of this story appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nThis week, we got two closely watched inflation reports: One on Tuesday that seemed fine-ish, and one Thursday that made everyone sit up straight and take notice.\nIf you\u2019re just clocking the headlines, it might seem like prices are both flatandsurging?\nThe reality is that consumer inflation (the kind regular schmoes like us feel) was pretty mild. Certain items are getting more expensive, like housing and meat, while others, like gasoline, have fallen.\nButwholesaleinflation (the kind businesses feel when making the stuff we buy), is another story.\nOn Thursday, the Producer Price Index, whichtracks what businesses are shelling out for raw materials every month,came inhot\u2014 up 3.3% year over year in July. That is the fastest pace since June 2022, the peak of the Covid-era inflation bonanza. At that time, producer prices were up 11.3% year over year \u2014 not exactly a moment any of us want to think about going back to.\nBusinesses have been eating Trump\u2019s tariffs. That\u2019s starting to change\nEven Wall Street, which lately has been drunk on a cocktail of AI hype and rate-cut anticipation, briefly sobered up to take in the Thursday wholesale report. (Stocks briefly dipped in the morning and finished the day mostly flat.)\nThe upshot: American businesses have been eating the higher prices tariffs create, partly because they suspected President Donald Trump would delay or scale back his agenda, and partly because they didn\u2019t want to invite one of Trump\u2019s public scoldings.\nBut companies can\u2019t keep that up forever, and they\u2019re starting to pass on the costs to you and me.\nThis is, after all, how tariffs work. Despite Trump\u2019s repeated lie that foreign governments pay for tariffs, the reality is (and has always been) that American businesses have to pay for them, and then consumers would be made to feel the pain.\n\u201cTariffs don\u2019t somehow disappear into the ether,\u201d wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. \u201cAnd if consumer prices don\u2019t accelerate from here, we have a profit margin hit on our hands. Pick your poison.\u201d\nHere\u2019s where things could get really icky for consumers: Right now, the lion\u2019s share of cost pressures aren\u2019t even coming from tariff-sensitive goods.\nTake housing, for example. Home prices are elevated largely because there aren\u2019t that many homes where a lot of people want to live. That sort of thing has little connection to global trade, and instead comes from the chronic lack of housing built after the 2008 real estate-fueled economic crash. Other staples like coffee and eggs have also shot up at various points in the past year because of weather issues and avian flu, respectively.\nBut in the coming months, those supply issues will still be present when the tariff pain kicks in. Even if you take Trump at his word that tariffs will make the country more prosperous over time, there\u2019s no way to escape the immediate impact of higher prices.\nThat shift could happen at a politically inconvenient time for Republicans heading into midterm elections next year.\nThe American public is increasingly souring on Trump\u2019s job performance. According to a Pew Research poll out Thursday, the president\u2019s job approval stands at 38%, with 60% disapproving.\nSo far, the administration has landed two major policy initiatives: tariffs, which Trump sees as a panacea for all economic ills, and his tax and spending law known as the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d \u2014 both of which garner \u201cconsiderably more disapproval than approval,\u201d according to Pew.\nThe full price impact of tariffs hasn\u2019t hit customers\u2019 wallets yet, and already 61% of Americans disapprove of the policy.\nTariffs, and the inflation they\u2019re creating, pose a political risk for Trump, whose agenda has been largely rubberstamped by the Republican-controlled legislature. That political risk seems to be irking the president already. Earlier this week, he called on Goldman Sachs to fire its top economist after the bank published research saying the thing most economists agree is true: that consumers arebound to pay the bulk of tariff costs as soon as October.\nTariffs are also threatening to derail another Trump priority \u2014 getting the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and thereby juice economic growth. That\u2019s something the central bank will be loath to do if prices continue rising.\nAt a White House event Thursday, Trump said inflation is \u201cdown to a perfect number.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/08\/15\/business\/inflation-cpi-ppi-reports-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Here\u2019s how Trump\u2019s tariffs could be impacting prices for US consumers","date":"2025-07-15","body":"US inflation heated back up in June, rising to its highest level in four months, as price increases \u2014including those fromtariffs\u2014 packed a bigger punch.\nConsumer prices rose 0.3% last month, pushing the annual inflation rate higher to 2.7%, the highest since February, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nTuesday\u2019s data came right in line with economists\u2019 forecasts for the headline CPI to rise from the0.1% monthly and 2.4% annual increases reported in May.\nThey expected higher gas prices would help lift the overall index (which was the case) and anticipated that a broader suite of goods would show the effect of businesses passing along higher import costs to consumers (which was also the case).\n\u201cTariffs are starting to bite,\u201d Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, told CNN in an interview. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as bad as expected, but you can see it in the data.\u201d\nExcluding gas and food, which tend to be quite volatile, core CPI came in below expectations by rising 0.2% from May and 2.9% for the 12 months ended in June. However, that\u2019san acceleration from 0.1% and 2.8%, respectively, the month before.\nStocks were mixed Tuesday morning. The Dow was down 250 points, or 0.5%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 was mostly flat and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.65%.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s a relief to see Tuesday\u2019s CPI in line with expectations, it still showed that inflation was hotter in June than it was in May,\u201d Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital, said in an email.\nIn recent months, President Donald Trump has enacteda sweeping trade policyof tacking steep tariffs on most goods that come into America.\nThe sheer breadth of the tariffs as well as the fits-and-starts approach to their implementation has roiled markets and caused heightened uncertainty among businesses and consumers as tohow much prices would move higher.\nHowever, inflation has remained relatively tame in recent months due to a variety of factors, including ongoing disinflation trends in housing and other key services, falling gas and travel prices (in part due toweakened demandfrom uncertainty), and businesses loading up on pre-tariff inventories.\nEconomists cautioned that the tariff-related price hikeswouldn\u2019t come quickly nor in one fell swoopand would likely start to hit consumers more as the year went on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really been an inventory story,\u201d Long said. \u201cBusinesses have done an excellent job of managing inventory, particularly the large retailers heading into April\u201d when the bulk of the tariff hikes were put into place.\nThe larger retailers were carrying about three months\u2019 worth of extra inventory, Long said.\n\u201cAnd so, you do the math in your head and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018OK, this summer, right?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re eventually going to run out of inventory or run down their inventory and have to bring in more items with the tariff costs.\u201d\nOn a relatively scattered basis, some items with high exposure to tariffs (the United States imports about 80% of toys from China, for example) have become more expensive, both private sector and federal reports such as CPI have shown.\nIn May, for example, the CPI report showed very few widespread impacts from higher tariffs; however, prices were on the rise for a smattering of goods \u2014 such as toys, appliances, sporting goods and tools \u2014 typically imported or heavily reliant upon imported materials and components.\nMonthly economic data can be quite volatile, and economists frequently caution that it\u2019s important to take a longer view. However, some of the pricing trends seen in May also showed up in June and, in some cases, in a bigger way.\nCommodities excluding food and gas:This index strips out the oft-volatile food and energy categories and is being closely scrutinized in the wake of higher tariffs. Prices rose 0.2% in June after being flat in May.\nApparel:Trump\u2019s tariffs wereexpected to raise the cost of most clothing, but the hardest hit items were expected to be some of the most basic (cheap T-shirts, socks, sneakers and undies). Overall apparel prices nudged up just 0.4% in June after declining in May and April.\nAppliances:Prices here leapt 1.9% in June after rising 0.7% in April and 0.6% in May. It was the highest monthly jump in appliance prices since August 2020, when homebound Americans upped their purchases of home goods during the Covid pandemic. Last month, the Trump administration extended the 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum to \u201cderivative products,\u201dincluding consumer appliances such as dryers, washing machines, refrigerators, ovens and garbage disposals.\nComputers, peripherals and smart home assistants:Prices heated up in this category for the third-consecutive month, rising 1.4%, the highest monthly increase since January 2024. While Trump gave a reprieve for tech giants,exempting somesmartphones, computers and electronics from tariffs, those products and parts are still exposed to the higher base tariff on Chinese imports. (Notably, Trump also has promised to levy higher tariffs on semiconductors, the chips that power scores of everyday items.)\nSporting goods:The pace of price hikes accelerated here, with the index rising 1.4% in June, up from 0.3% in May. The June increase is the largest in 18 months.\nTools, hardware and supplies:During much of 2023 and 2024, prices fell for this category. In June, prices rose 0.7%, marking the fifth-straight month of increases.\nToys:For the second month in a row, prices rose by 1.4%, a back-to-back jump only seen during periods of abnormally high inflation (2022, 1980). And more price hikes could be coming down the pike,Hasbro CEO told CNN\u2019s Audie Cornishthis week.\nVideo equipment:Prices surged a record 4.5% in June after rising 1% in May in this category that typically has seen more deflation than inflation since 1998, when the BLS started tracking it.\nWindows and floor coverings and other linens:After rising 0.3% from May to April, prices in this category surged 4.2% higher in June, a record-high increase (BLS started tracking this category in early 1999). The US textile industry has shrunk considerably in recent decades, resulting in a high reliance on imported linens.\nThe June CPI was expected to be a \u201cturning point\u201d where steep tariffs would make an even bigger mark within the inflation data.\nHowever, the extent to which tariffs could drive inflation higher and how long that may last, remains an open question.\n\u201cWe do have to bear in mind that goods are still only 25% of the core CPI, and so it takes a pretty meaningful increase in those goods prices to really lead to a spike in core inflation,\u201d Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN earlier this week.\nThe price increases seen on the goods side have been kept in check by disinflation (slower price increases) or deflation (outright price declines) in other components of the CPI \u2014 dynamics both long in swing prior to tariffs andothers attributed to tariff-related fallout.\nRelated articleAmericans could pay more for these items from Mexico and the EU if Trump makes good on his latest tariff threats\n\u201cI think you\u2019re still seeing, in many ways, the long tail of the pandemic in the services numbers \u2014 things like auto insurance continuing to subside on trend as vehicle price inflation has cooled off\u201d as well as housing-related price hikes, House said. \u201cAnd in some ways, the recent inflation numbers have captured some of the downside effects on demand, for example, the drop in oil prices and the drop in travel services.\u201d\nEconomists such a Navy Federal Credit Union\u2019s Long cautioned that the tariff-related impacts remain early days.\n\u201cThis feels like inning No. 1, the early stages of what will likely be more and more items showing that price increase,\u201d she said.\nShe noted how prices on coffee and oranges \u2014 categories already hit hard by climate-related impacts and also expected to feel added price pressure from tariffs \u2014 spiked in June. Trump\u2019s latesttariff threats on Canada and Mexicocould reignite fears of higher food prices, she added.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t buy a new washing machine every week, but you do buy fruits and vegetables,\u201d she said.\nTrump on Tuesday cheered that consumer prices were low and White House officials downplayed the effect of tariffs on overall inflation. Trump urged for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates \u201cnow!\u201d\n\u201cI think one thing that Wall Street, a lot of economists, (the) market in general, got wrong early on was that tariffs were going to cause a substantial price level rise, which just hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview on Bloomberg prior to the CPI\u2019s release Tuesday morning.\nHowever, while the June CPI data \u201cscreams\u201d that Fed officials will likely take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach on further rate cuts when they meet later this month, there is some growing pressure for easing later this year, said Long, the Navy Federal Credit Union economist Long said.\n\u201cThere is strain on the middle-class consumer right now and middle-class families: The housing market is frozen \u2026 the job market is frozen outside of a handful of sectors like healthcare,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it would be really helpful to the overall economy to see the Federal Reserve take a little bit of pressure off in September. I know it\u2019s a hard call looking at this data, but just from the middle-class perspective, some relief in September would be really helpful.\u201d\nThe CPI report is the first of two major pieces of inflation data due out this week. On Wednesday morning, the BLS will release the Producer Price Index, which is expected to show acontinued pickup in wholesale-level inflation.\nCNN\u2019s John Towfighi and Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/15\/economy\/us-cpi-consumer-price-index-inflation-june","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Wall Street traders have even coined a phrase for this pattern, calling it theTACO trade,short for Trump Always Chickens Out.\nTherein lies the challenge: It\u2019s incredibly difficult to measure the tariffs\u2019 impact, given the extensive lags between when they\u2019re announced and when they actually hit the US economy.\nIt can take weeks or months for tariffs to filter through the system, going from manufacturers to wholesalers to retailers and ultimately American consumers.\nStores knew tariffs were coming, so many tried to beat the clock by importing inventory before tariffs kicked in. That means many items on store shelves this spring and early summer were still priced at those low pre-tariff levels.\nIn a reflection of that trend, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.4% in May, down from 3% in January when Trump took office.\nBut eventually that pre-tariff inventory will run out, raising the risk that price hikes are still on the way.\n\u201cIf people think just because we got away with two months and it\u2019s all good, that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush and director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\nAs Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has noted, some goods exposed to tariffs have experienced significant price increases, including appliances, toys, computers and other electronics.\nYet those price hikes have been masked by price drops elsewhere,including on gasoline.\n\u201cIt looks like all the numbers are coming in their favor, but you can\u2019t just put all this price pressure into the system and expect it will disappear. It can\u2019t,\u201d said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nDavid Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, agreed that tariffs will eventually feed through \u2014 even though they haven\u2019t yet in a big way.\n\u201cWe should be careful. Complacency could come from delayed reaction. That\u2019s the danger of delayed reactions,\u201d Kelly said.\nThe JPMorgan executive compared it to a toddler who falls on the pavement and doesn\u2019t immediately start crying. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean injury was avoided; the reaction may just be delayed.\n\u201cThe economy is OK, but it\u2019s losing some momentum here. And I think the tariff uncertainty is very real,\u201d Kelly said.\nOf course, it\u2019s almost impossible to forecast precisely how this will play out.\nThere is no playbook for how a modern economy reacts to on-again, off-again tariffs at the scale Trump has proposed. The matter is complicated by the 2022 inflation crisis \u2014 the worst in 40 years \u2014 and the psychological scars from that episode. Investors, small business owners and consumers are more sensitive to price hikes than during Trump\u2019s first term.\nWall Street cranked up the pressure on the White House after those April 2 tariffs shocked many, coming in higher than even the worst-case scenarios.\nAfter bond and stock markets freaked out by pricing in an imminent global recession, Trump blinked. He paused the tariffs for 90 days to allow time to negotiate.\nThat delay set the stage for an epic market recovery, with US stocks recouping all of their steep losses in lightning speed. In the eyes of investors, tariffs went from a clear-and-present danger to merely background noise.\n\u201cMy feeling is the administration will feel somewhat empowered to play hardball because the stock market is at an all-time high,\u201d said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Wealth.\nUS markets finished at record highs on Thursday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the economy added abetter-than-expected 147,000 jobs in June. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked down to 4.1%.\nHowever, beneath the surface of that June jobs report,there were some concerning signals about the state of the labor market.\nFor instance, job growth was concentrated in a limited number of sectors, not widespread as jobseekers and economists would prefer. And the unemployment rate fell in part because the number of jobseekers fell, a trend that Morgan Stanley said reflects a \u201cchilling effect\u201d from the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown.\n\u201cI worry more about a recession and unemployment rising than inflation,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, chief market strategist at Man Group, the world\u2019s largest listed hedge fund.\nHooper said that while tariff-driven inflation is on the way, it will likely be short-lived.\nOn the other hand, policy uncertainty linked to trade can depress business investment in the medium term.\n\u201cThere seems to be something of a perfect storm pressuring many households,\u201d Hooper said, referring to price increases and student loan payments resuming.\nThat\u2019s why Hooper urged the Trump administration to get trade deals done \u201cquickly\u201d to give businesses clarity on the rules of the road.\n\u201cIn that kind of environment,\u201d Hooper said, \u201call you need is a modest increase in unemployment to tip an economy into much slower growth \u2013 and potentially a recessionary environment.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/08\/business\/trump-tariffs-market-inflation-jobs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Prices are now starting to rise because of tariffs. Economists say this is just the beginning","date":"2025-07-10","body":"Economists, researchers and analysts have warned that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping trade policy of tacking steep tariffs on most goods that come into America will deliver a taxing blow to consumers via higher prices.\nHowever, recent months\u2019 economic data has shown that overall inflation has remainedfairly tame.\nTrump and members of his administration tout the positive economic reports as signs that tariffs are working. However, the chorus of concern is growing: Prices are moving higher, and economists say this is just the beginning.\nHere\u2019s a look at the mechanisms behind why price hikes, and hotter inflation, are a slow burn:\nTariffs have been applied in a staggered manner:Theearliest tariffs went into effectin February (China, non-USMCA goods) and March (steel, aluminum), but the bulk were not announced or applied until April or later.\nTrade policy and tariffs are in flux:There have been plenty of instances where announced tariffs have been postponed, suddenly nixed, or unexpectedly increased or decreased in size.\nShipping takes time:Sea cargo shipments can take weeks to more than a month to reach the US from other countries.\nDomestic supply chains take time, too:Once goods land on US soil, they don\u2019t hit shelves the very next day. In addition to domestic transport times, the imported products (which are not always finished goods but rather parts and materials) have to still go through the manufacturing and production processes before being distributed to sales channels.\nInventories were loaded up before tariffs hit:Near the end of last year, businesses frontloaded import orders to prepare for any disruptions that could come froma massive, and short-lived East and Gulf Coast port strikeand also to get ahead of potential tariffs. Those stockpiling efforts surged this year as steep \u2014 and unexpectedly expansive \u2014 tariffs came into view and during periods in which they were postponed or lessened.\nSome costs are beingeaten:First, foreign exporters are absorbing some of the added costs. A Goldman Sachs analysis puts that share at about 20%, meaning that the remaining 80% of higher costs from tariffs (which are added to the price of wholesale goods when they hit US soil) have been split between US businesses and US consumers. Goldman Sachs economists expect that eventually about 70% of the direct cost of tariffs will be passed onto consumers through higher prices. (However, that 70% could move higher, depending on how much domestic producers change their prices as well, according to the analysis).\nBusinesses are hesitant to pass on higher prices:Consumers, hammered for years by a bout of high inflation, don\u2019t have the appetite \u2014 or the savings \u2014 for higher prices. \u201cFirms\u2019 pricing power is just getting a little weakened because consumer spending is starting to soften,\u201d Nicole Cervi, a Wells Fargo economist, told CNN.\nAwareness of goods prices is lower in summer than fall and winter:The US is a service-heavy economy, especially in the summertime, when spending is directed more at travel, recreation and leisure. However, some goods prices are already on the rise, and companies are warning more are on the way. However, goods will play a more central role in household budgets come fall and winter, when back-to-school season and spendy holidays such as Halloween and Christmas hit. \u201cI think some of this might become more real for people\u201d later this year, said Tyler Schipper, associate professor in economics and data analysis at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota.\nEconomic data is often lagged:Next week, for example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release critical inflation data that covers the month of June.\nInflation indices are comprehensive:Rising goods prices are showing up in the inflation data; however, they\u2019ve largely been overshadowed by factors such as falling gas prices and a continued slowing of price hikes for services, particularly rent and housing. As such, inflation data to this point has remained fairly muted \u2014 for now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that tariff effects have not shown up strongly in official consumer prices yet,\u201d according to a Goldman Sachs\u2019 July 8 note.\nHowever, the seemingly muted headline inflation numbers don\u2019t tell the full story: Goods prices \u2014 particularly in tariff-exposed categories \u2014 are already on the rise, both private-sector and federal data shows.\nThe May Consumer Price Index showed that several tariff-sensitive categories saw price increases:\nA DataWeave analysis of 200,000 products on 13 major US e-commerce sites show that prices have risen since January:\n\u201cThe percentage changes are definitely higher than what we\u2019ve seen in previous years,\u201d Karthik Bettadapura, co-founder and CEO of DataWeave, told CNN in an interview.\nIn June 2024, for example, home and furniture prices were up 1.9% from January, toy prices were up 0.4%, and apparel and footwear were up 0.7%, DataWeave data shows.\nBettadapura said he anticipates a further and broader \u201cprice creep\u201d in the coming months as tariffs ripple through the supply chain. And given ongoing pushback on higher prices, he expects there also to be a rise in shrinkflation (where brands may trim package sizes) and private-label expansion.\nThe June CPI, due out next week, also is expected to be the \u201cturning point\u201d where the steeply higher effective tariff rate will make a bigger mark on overall inflation, said Wells Fargo\u2019s Cervi, noting expected gains in the closely watched core goods category (which excludes gas and food).\n\u201cThe core goods side will start to leg up higher because of this tariff pass-through starting to take effect,\u201d she said.\nWells Fargo expects that the overall CPI could peak at 2.9% later this year (in part because of the further disinflationary effects from the services side).\nBut even if inflationary impacts are \u201cmodest,\u201d the effects on Americans could cut deeper, said Schipper, from the University of St. Thomas.\n\u201cRight now, I am less concerned about inflation building on itself,\u201d Schipper said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a cost to consumers that are struggling.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/10\/economy\/tariffs-higher-prices-inflation","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump denies inflation is hurting Americans. It\u2019s the same mistake that haunted Biden","date":"2025-11-04","body":"\u201cWe have no inflation,\u201d President Donald Trump said in his\u201c60 Minutes\u201d interviewSunday evening. \u201cOur groceries are down.\u201d\nAnd withthose two false claims, Trump is repeating a political mistake that haunted his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and contributed to the Democrats losing the White House: Trump appears to be denying the economic reality that people are experiencing\ufeff in their everyday lives.\nWhether or not Trump is making a similar political miscalculation remains to be seen. Today\u2019s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City could serve as an indication.\nInflation is far from the crisis levels of the Biden years, but it never went away. And inflation is on the rebound again, rising in September to the highest annual rate since January in part because of the president\u2019s tariffs.\nGrocery prices aren\u2019t down, either \u2013 they\u2019re up across all major product categories, rising 1.4% since Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nDenying that reality is a tough sell to Americans, many of whom seriously hate this economy, mainly because they feel those higher prices every time they go to the store.\nA newCNN poll conducted by SSRSshowed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 47% call the economy and cost of living the top issue facing the country.\nBidenpolled miserably on the economy, too.\nIn June 2022, as millions of Americans were grappling with the highest gas price of their lifetimes and inflation hit a four-decade high, Biden highlighted strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\n\u201cLook, here\u2019s where we are. We have the fastest growing economy in the world,\u201d Biden said on ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!,\u201da claim that CNN later deemed false.\nBiden conceded that inflation is \u201cthe bane of our existence,\u201d but downplayed it by saying it\u2019s \u201cmostly in food, and in gasoline.\u201d\nThat dismissiveness probably hurt the Democrats in last year\u2019s election, considering Americans in 2024 said affordability was their chief concern. Even if inflation was falling, prices were still rising \u2013 just more slowly, and from painfully high levels. So voters weren\u2019t exactly swayed by the Biden administration\u2019s frequent statements that theeconomy was on fire.\n\u201cWages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3% \u2014 the lowest in the world and trending lower,\u201d Bidensaidduring his 2024 State of the Union address. \u201cIt takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.\u201d\nVoters didn\u2019t buy it. Biden\u2019s speech dismissed the cumulative effect of rising prices that voters were living through.\nTrump\u2019s tactics aren\u2019t exactlyBiden\u2019s. In 2023 and 2024, Biden correctly argued that price hikes were slowing. And when Biden acknowledged high prices, he typically tried to assign blame to corporations, lambasting \u201cgreedflation\u201d and \u201cshrinkflation.\u201d\nTrump is just straight-up doling out untruths \u2013 andblaming Biden.\nBut either way, the effect may be the same. Americans don\u2019t take kindly to politicians who refuse to see voters\u2019 lived experiences \u2013 especially when they\u2019re smacked in the face with high prices on every supermarket trip.\nInterestingly, Trump identified Biden\u2019s flaw, and he and his campaign frequently criticized the former president for failing to sufficiently acknowledge the pain inflation had inflicted on Americans. Trump at campaign stops would sometimes pose with groceries, commenting on how unaffordable they had become.\nThe consequence of becoming president, of course, is that those inherited problemsquickly became Trump\u2019s. But blaming Biden or denying reality doesn\u2019t seem to be working. Trump is already starting to shoulder much of the blame for the bad economic vibes: About 6 in 10 (61%) say Trump\u2019s policies have worsened US economic conditions, according to CNN\u2019s poll.\nAmericans aren\u2019t just kvetching about high prices; they\u2019re (not) putting their money where their mouths are, and they\u2019re changing their behavior.Chipotle, Coke, Crocsand other consumer brands said during earnings calls with Wall Street analysts last month that middle-class and lower-income customers are closing their wallets.\nDespite a still-robust economy, on paper anyway, lackluster hiring is adding to Americans\u2019 frayed nerves, as is the erosion of federal safety-net benefits.Loan defaultsand delinquencies are on the rise again among some of America\u2019s most vulnerable.\nThe problem with inflation is that it\u2019s cumulative. There is a snowballing effect from years of price hikes \u2013 even if those price increases are smaller today than under Biden after the pandemic.\nThe typical American household is spending $208 more per month to buy the same goods and services as they were in September 2024, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics data based on the most recent inflation report. Keep in mind that in September 2024, Trump was on the campaign trail claiming inflation was out of control.\nZooming out further, Moody\u2019s found that due to inflation, the typical household is spending $1,043 more per month than they did at the start of 2021.\nIn other words, to buy the same amount of stuff that Americans purchased four years ago, they ne\ufeffed to spend $1,000 more of their paychecks.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week explained why Americans don\u2019t care about metrics that politicians like to cite, including strong spending or gross domestic product booms.\n\u201cConsumers are not interested in that story,\u201d Powell said in a media briefing Wednesday. \u201cTheir prices are higher. More than that, the reason they are so unhappy about inflation is the inflation we had in 2021, 2022 and 2023. You can say prices aren\u2019t going up as much, but that doesn\u2019t mean that people aren\u2019t feeling those higher prices from the inflation we had two or three years ago. They are, and that is why a large part of the public, if you sample people, inflation is still very much making people unhappy.\u201d\nPowell noted it will take time \u2013 and growing paychecks \u2013 for the effect of higher prices to wear off.\n\u201cIt will feel better over time, but that will take time,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, the lesson for Trump may have been best stated by Democratic political strategist David Plouffe.\nIn \u201cOriginal Sin,\u201d the book by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson into Biden\u2019s late-term cognitive decline, Plouffe said the fatal mistake by Democrats  was to deny the reality voters were witnessing.\n\u201cNever again can we as a party suggest to people that what they\u2019re seeing is not true,\u201d he said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/04\/business\/trump-biden-economy-inflation","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Inflation rose less than expected last month despite Trump\u2019s tariffs","date":"2025-06-11","body":"Inflation rose less than expected in May, a month when the effects of higher tariffs were starting to become more widespread.\nConsumer prices rose 0.1% last month, while the annual inflation rate increased to 2.4% from afour-year-low of 2.3% notched in April, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe better-than-expected inflation reading is welcome news for Americans worn down by the higher cost of living and who are fearful of whether tariffs will drive that higher. However, while the tariff impacts weren\u2019t prevalent in Wednesday\u2019s report, the latest CPI was lightly pockmarked with potential indications of price hikes and weaker consumer demand.\nMay\u2019s overall inflation readings came in better than expected. Economists had projected that falling gas prices would keep the overall monthly inflation rate in check while year-ago comparisons became less favorable.\nForecasts called for a 0.2% monthly rise and for the CPI to increase 2.5% on an annual basis, according to FactSet.\nWednesday\u2019s report was \u201cpretty unambiguously good,\u201d said Michael Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo.\n\u201cIt was a good reading in terms of looking for softer inflation,\u201d Pugliese told CNN in an interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early to draw any conclusions from whether the tariffs are having \u2018X\u2019 effect or \u2018Y\u2019 effect.\u201d\nStock futures jumped higher after the data release, and the Dow was around 165 points higher by midday, or 0.38%. The S&P 500 rose 0.15% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.18%.\nFor now, a closely watched measurement of underlying inflation is holding steady.\nThe core CPI, which excludes the highly volatile categories of food and energy, rose just 0.1% from April and held pat at 2.8%.\nEconomists have anticipated that price pressures would continue to build as businesses try to adapt to President Donald Trump\u2019s sharp escalation in the US tariff rate and unpredictable trade policy.\nHowever, they\u2019ve also cautioned that it may take some time before higher tariff rates result in pricier items for consumers and, ultimately, higher inflation rates.\nAmong the key reasons for that: Economic data is lagged; there have been significant shifts in tariff policy, and some of the most aggressive duties were curtailed, paused or lessened; businesses front-loaded purchases, building up their pre-tariff inventory and offering up discounts to keep from alienating customers; and some costs from the initial waves of new tariffs might have beenabsorbed by retailers and manufacturers.\n\u201cBear in mind that this report covers May, and most of the big tariff changes didn\u2019t occur until April or May,\u201d Pugliese said. \u201cI always like to remind folks who expect the economic data to respond like markets do, and that\u2019s just not quite how it works. In the real world, companies are not going to make super-snap hiring decisions, investment decisions, price decisions \u2014 particularly when there is so much uncertainty.\u201d\n\u201cThis is something that plays out over a number of months,\u201d he added.\nSome businesses faced with higher tariff bills have opted to raise prices immediately, while others have tried to draw out the spillover to customers.\nIn mid-May, for example, Walmart\u2019s CEO said the world\u2019s largest retailer would \u201cdo our best to keep our prices as low as possible\u201d but that price hikeswould begin later in May.\nCompanies like Lalo, which sells a variety of products for babies and toddlers, have some of the greatest exposure to tariff risks. The overwhelming majority of baby products (99% of car seats, for example) are sourced from China, according to research from Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.\nMichael Wieder, who co-founded Lalo with Greg Davidson six and half years ago, has tried to keep customers aware of what the company was navigating. He delivered a weekly \u201cTariff Tuesday\u201d email to show how the company \u2014 which this year got a big foot in the door at Target \u2014 is navigating the choppy tariff waters.\nBut the recent \u201cTariff Tuesday\u201d e-mails came with some unwelcome news: After months of holding off, the company would have to raise its prices.\nOn Tuesday,Lalo laid outhow prices for the majority of their products would increase as of June 23.\n\u201cWe had held out for long enough, but we have goods coming in now that are facing a 30% to 55% tariff, and others at 10%,\u201d said Wieder. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to everybody that we need to keep the lights on. We need to pay our employees. This is not about increasing profits. Our profits are not growing because we\u2019re increasing prices \u2014 in fact, the opposite.\u201d\nLalo is eating a good portion of the higher tariffs, while the company\u2019s retail partners have absorbed higher costs as well, Wieder said.\n\u201cWe tried to put the smallest amount on the consumer that we possibly could,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we worked hard on that. We\u2019ve run a million scenarios that are in the garbage, because things have changed so fast and so frequently.\u201d\nThe overall price hikes seen in the May CPI report were largely driven by housing-related inflation. The shelter index (which measures the cost of living in a home) rose by 0.3% for the month but saw inflation slow to 3.9%, the lowest rate since November 2021.\nGrocery and restaurant prices moved higher for the month, rising 0.3%, as well; however, egg prices dropped for the second month in a row, falling 2.7%.\nServices inflation was fairly muted, which economists say could indicate softer demand and a consumer pullback; however, certain declines in categories such as air fares could be attributable to seasonal adjustment calculations made by the BLS, said Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS Investment Bank.\nRelated articleDOGE layoffs may have compromised the accuracy of government data\nIn terms of calculations, it was unclear whether the BLS\u2019 recent reductions in collections were affecting data, he added.\nWednesday\u2019s CPI report showed very little widespread impacts from higher tariffs; however, certain tariff-sensitive goods industries are showing notably sharper price hikes.\nAppliance prices rose by 0.8% for the second month in a row, the highest monthly rate in nearly four years. Toy prices climbed for the second consecutive month, leaping by 1.3% from April.\nSporting goods and tools showed similar pricing trends as well.\nApparel prices, however, dropped 0.4% for the month.\nThe May CPI data shouldn\u2019t be taken as an indication that foreign manufacturers are paying for the tariffs, noted Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar.\nThat notion is \u201cnot supported by the broader economic data; the US dollar hasn\u2019t strengthened and import prices excluding tariffs haven\u2019t fallen,\u201d he wrote in a note on Wednesday. \u201cWho then, is paying for the tariffs right now? By process of elimination, US businesses who import goods must be eating the cost right now. These companies can\u2019t shoulder this burden forever, which still strongly suggests that consumer price inflation is going to tick up in coming months.\u201d\nTo what extent businesses arecontinuing to use their margins to absorb price increasescould become clearer in data coming out later this week. The Producer Price Index, a critical gauge on wholesale-level inflation, will be released Thursday morning.\nBut, for now, the totality of the economic data isn\u2019t expected to draw out Federal Reserve policymakers from theirmonthslong stint as wallflowers, economists say.\n\u201cThe latest CPI data will keep data-dependent Fed officials comfortably numb,\u201d Gregory Daco, EY-Parthenon\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a note on Wednesday. \u201cWith inflation not yet showing signs of a significant reacceleration and headline job gains still solid, there appears to be little urgency to act.\u201d\nBut beneath the surface, Daco cautioned,job gains are weakening, layoff announcements are growing and the unemployment rate is holding steady on lower labor force participation \u2014 pressured downward by reduced immigration.\n\u201cThe risk? Policymakers may be numbed into inaction just as economic cracks deepen,\u201d he wrote.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/11\/economy\/us-consumer-price-index-may","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Americans pulled back on their spending in April amid tariff rollout","date":"2025-05-30","body":"American consumers reined in their spending and socked away their money in April followinga tariff-fueled buying bingethe month before, according to new data released Friday that also showed inflation cooled off again.\nFriday\u2019s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer spending rose 0.2% last month, a weaker-than-anticipated reading but a notable retreat from March, when spending soared 0.7% as Americans front-loaded purchases \u2014 notably new cars \u2014 ahead of potential price increases from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nIn April, consumers saw a nice 0.8% boost to their incomes, a jump likely attributed to larger Social Security payments as well as continued resilience in the labor market; however, a lot of those funds were plunked into piggy banks: The personal saving rate leapt to 4.9% from 4.3%, according to Friday\u2019s report.\n\u201cJust as you\u2019d expect, consumers stayed away from the purchase of durable goods like clothing and cars and instead spent mostly on life\u2019s necessities like housing, health care, and food services,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote in commentary issued Friday. \u201cThis is a trade war report where the consumer is clearly gun-shy.\u201d\nThe latest data also showed inflation moving closer to the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%. However, it also indicated that tariff-related price pressures may be already hitting consumers.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures price index was 2.1% for the 12 months ended in April, a slowdown from the 2.3% annual gain in March. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.1%, a slight acceleration after holding steady in March.\nThe biggest price gains last month were seen in durable goods, which rose 0.5%.\nEconomists were expecting the PCE price index to rise 0.2% from March and to ease to an annual rate of 2.2%. Spending was expected to slow to 0.4%, according to FactSet.\nInflation is now back at its lowest rate in years, matchinga 2.1% gain in September 2024that was, at the time, a three-and-a-half-year low.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy categories, the core PCE price index rose 0.1% from March and slowed to an annual rate of 2.5%, the lowest rate since March 2021.\nInflation is sitting just a hair\u2019s breadth above the Fed\u2019s 2% target; however, there likely will beno victory laps nor corks poppedfrom the Fed: Inflation may have been on a cooling course, but the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs \u2014 the bulk of whichare in a temporary holding pattern\u2014 threaten to reverse that progress.\nWhile the tariffs themselves remain in flux \u2014 especially following a US Court of International Trade ruling this week that blocked a large swath of them and a subsequent appeals court ruling that put them back into play \u2014 economists weren\u2019t expecting the early wave of import duties to have an immediate effect on prices nor on the April inflation data.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at very backwards-looking data; we\u2019re looking into April, and it\u2019s hard to say (to what extent) the total effects of the tariffs have come through,\u201d Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade US, said in an interview with CNN. \u201cI think there\u2019s a reasonable case to be made that each report is not going to be quite so rosy as this.\u201d\nAnd, with spending and incomes holding up for now, the Fed has the luxury of being able to continue tonot have to rush through any interest rate cutsjust yet, he said.\n\u201cThe Fed would really like to see that core and the headline (inflation rates) going down a bit more, because if they cut rates, they might reignite that inflation flame that hasn\u2019t gone out already,\u201d he said.\nJared Fisher joins The Lead\nRelated videoSmall biz owner: Don\u2019t need Trump to \u2018micromanage\u2019 company\nThere have been significant shifts in tariff policy, and some of the most aggressive duties were curtailed or paused; businesses front-loaded purchases, building up their pre-tariff inventory; and some costs from the initial waves of new tariffs might have been absorbed by retailers and manufacturers.\nThe latest data lands at a time when uncertainty is swelling about the extent to which Trump\u2019s sweeping policies \u2014 including efforts totack steep tariffs on most imported goods\u2014 could upend global order and the US economy.\nBut that massive uncertainty caused by Trump\u2019s policies could negatively ripple through the economy by affecting how consumers and businesses spend.\n\u201cUncertainty is an actual driving force in the economy, and on the business side, they\u2019re shaking their heads saying, \u2018we don\u2019t know what to do; our customers are cutting their orders,\u2019\u201d North said. \u201cGiven that atmosphere and this continuous changing in the tariff situation, I see hiring really slowing down in the next couple of months.\u201d\nA batch of labor market data is due out next week, with the most critical piece being the May jobs report on Friday morning. Economists are still building their forecasts, but early estimates show they expect monthly job gains to slow sharply to around 125,000 from177,000 in Apriland for the unemployment rate to tick up to 4.3%.\nWhile economists have warned that the better-than-expected data seen in recent months is the calm before the storm, the economy is holding its own for now \u2014 despite the ongoing volatility andrecession fears.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a lot of \u2018See, I told you,\u2019\u201d coming from the Trump administration, North said. \u201cThey\u2019ll likely say that everything is going right, inflation is right, income is right, spending is right, and then the trade deficit in goods is cut in half.\u201d\nHowever, it remains to be seen how long this resilience lasts and to what extent the volatility weighs on the economy.\nStocks fell Friday after President Donald Trump saidChinahas \u201ctotally violated\u201d its trade agreement with the United States, sending another jolt to markets after a whiplash week of tariff developments.\nSeparate data released Friday by the Census Bureau showed that the United States\u2019 trade deficit with its trading partners dropped by 46% last month.\nTrade deficits capture the difference between a country\u2019s exports minus imports. Last month, American exports grew by $6.3 billion, while imports declined by a whopping $68.4 billion.\nThe stunning decline in imports could mean retailers have less of an inventory buffer, leaving them less able to avoid paying future tariffs \u2014 and that could lead to price increases for US consumers.\nCNN\u2019s Elisabeth Buchwald and John Towfighi contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/30\/economy\/us-consumer-spending-inflation-fed-pce-april","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s tariffs could make Europe, not America, \u2018Great Again.\u2019 At least when it comes to inflation","date":"2025-05-02","body":"President Donald Trump might want a new, \u201cAmerica First\u201d world, but in the race to control inflation the United States may actually come last. That\u2019s because, while his tariff hikes are widely expected to jack up prices at home, they could lower inflation across the pond.\nThe reasons are multiple, ranging from a possible influx of low-priced Chinese exports into Europe to the recent rise in the value of the euro. Aside from the benefit to consumers\u2019 pockets, lower inflation will give European policymakers room tocut interest ratesif the economy needs a helping hand \u2014 whereas the US could find it hard to lower borrowing costs if the world\u2019s biggest economy needs a boost.\nThat\u2019s just one way Trump could \u201cMake Europe Great Again,\u201d as economists at Nomura, a global financial services group, put it in a recent research note.\nInfluential forecasters at the International Monetary Fund also see Trump\u2019s tariffs pushing inflation higher in the US, they wrote in their latestoutlook report.\nThe main reason higher US tariffs will likely raise prices in America is because tariffs are taxes on imports, whether of finished goods or parts.\nThere are alreadysignssome companies willpass on the costsof the tariffs to American consumers, rather than absorb them. For example, the Adidas CEO said earlier this week that cost increases due to higher tariffs \u201cwill eventually cause price increases\u201d in the US. Outside of the US, \u201cthere is no reason\u201d to raise prices because of the levies, Bj\u00f8rn Gulden later added.\nThe impact of US tariffs introduced in 2018, during Trump\u2019s first term, suggests an inflation bump is on the way. A 2019study, co-authored by Mary Amiti at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, found a \u201ccomplete pass-through\u201d of those tariffs into the domestic prices of imported goods.\nEven non-tariffed companies might raise their prices. \u201cDomestic producers raise their prices when their foreign competitors are forced to raise prices due to higher tariffs,\u201d Amiti and her co-authors wrote.\nWhile Trump has already implemented an additional 10% tariff on goods imports from almost all countries, as well as much higher tariffs on some sectors and a gigantic duty on imports from China, the European Union has so far only threatenedlimited retaliatory tariffson US goods.\nThe EU may yet put in place a stronger response, which could raise the prices of imports from the US, but the impact on European inflation would still be a lot smaller than what\u2019s in the cards for the US. That\u2019s because, in contrast with Trump\u2019s maximalist approach, Europe would be \u201conly putting tariffs on a single country\u2019s imports,\u201d George Buckley, chief European economist at Nomura, told CNN.\nAs things stand, economists say, Trump\u2019s tariffs are more likely to slow inflation in the EU this year and next, in four ways.\nOne is what Christine Lagarde, European Central Bank president, has described as likely efforts by China to \u201creroute\u201d its exports away from the US, possibly to Europe. \u201cThat would have a dampening impact on prices,\u201d she said in aninterviewon the Washington Post Live platform last week. More goods on the market mean more competition, which means lower prices for shoppers.\nJack Allen-Reynolds, a senior economist at consultancy Capital Economics, explained in a note in April: \u201cIncreased competition from cheap Chinese imports could push goods prices down\u2026 And with China currently facing much higher tariffs than we had expected, its exporters might slash prices further to offload goods that would otherwise have been sent to the US.\u201d\nRelated articleThe last boats without crippling tariffs from China are arriving. The countdown to higher prices has begun\nChina is already shipping a lot less to the US, with industry data showing a plunge in sailings last month.\nTrump\u2019s whipsaw policy changes have also driven investors away from US assets \u2014 including the dollar. In contrast, the euro has strengthened since April 2, when Trumpunveiledthe 10% tariffs on nearly all countries and even higher levies on products from about 60 nations and trading blocs, including the EU.\nThe euro has gained 3% against the currencies of the eurozone\u2019s main trading partners, including the dollar, and stands not far off the record high hit on April 22. A stronger currency makes imports cheaper, which generally results in more goods, higher competition and thus lower prices on the market.\nAgainst just the dollar, the euro has risen by a larger 4% since April 2.\n\u201cI think concerns about the US economy have dominated (the dollar\u2019s slide),\u201d said Ruben Segura-Cayuela, head of economic research for Europe at the Bank of America. \u201cAnd second, I think a lot of the recent developments have created some risk premium for US financial assets.\u201d\nMeanwhile, expectations of ahit to the global economyfrom Trump\u2019s tariffs have helped drive energy prices lower since April 2, as traders predict less demand for fuels.\nOil prices tanked in the wake of his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcements. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has lost 17% since then.\nNatural gas prices have also declined and more sharply in Europe than the US. That could get worse, based onWorld Bank forecastspublished this week. It sees US natural gas prices surging overall in 2025, with another small rise in 2026, while European prices are predicted to increase only modestly this year and fall next year.\nThe expectations ofweaker economic growthhave another, broader effect too. Coupled with extreme uncertainty about the direction of trade policies, they are discouraging spending by businesses and denting consumer confidence in Europe. That is the fourth curb on prices, with economists predicting that consumers will also eventually spend less.\nWhile the trade war could slow price increases in Europe, there are still some factors that could nudge inflation higher in the region. One is the recentparliamentary approvalin Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, of a plan to massively increase investment in infrastructure anddefense. Another is anagreementby European leaders in March to ramp updefense spending.\nBut all that spending will take a while to happen, possibly years.\nAnd with the current level of global uncertainty, who knows what could happen by then.\nCNN\u2019s Vanessa Yurkevich contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/02\/economy\/europe-lower-inflation-us-tariffs-analysis-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

A 10% tariff on all US imports will go into effect on Saturday, with even higher tariffs slated for April 9.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs were worse than feared, triggeringa global stock-market sell-offthis week. Economists at JPMorgan now see global recession odds at 60% if the tariffs are kept in place. Various forecasters are projecting consumer prices, especially for cars, to ratchet higher this year.\nTrump\u2019s risky bet to rectify trade imbalances and bring back production to the US could send the economy barreling toward\u201cstagflation,\u201da toxic combination of stagnant economic growth and rising unemployment coupled with accelerating inflation. The Fed would have to tackle that two-headed beast head-on, just like it did in the 1970s.\n\u201cThe Fed is in a tough spot with inflation set to accelerate and the economy poised to slow,\u201d Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an analyst note Friday.\nShortly before Powell\u2019s speech, Trump in a post on his social media platform called on the Fed to lower borrowing costs, accusing the central bank\u2019s leader of playing politics.\n\u201cThis would be a perfect time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates,\u201d Trump wrote.\nFed officials have adopted a holding pattern on interest rates, waiting for inflation to slow further and to see how Trump\u2019s major policy shifts show up in economic data. They still expect to cut rates at some point this year, according totheir latest economic projections released last month.\nThe Fed cut rates three times last year on signs that inflation was slowing. But that progress stalled out around the turn of the year, which weakened the case for further rate cuts and ultimately prompted the Fed to stand pat in January. The Fed continued to hold borrowing costs steadylast month.\nAmerica\u2019s job market also remains solid, according tofresh government data out Friday, meaning there isn\u2019t any urgent need for the Fed to provide the economy with relief through additional cuts.\nRelated articleChina imposes 34% reciprocal tariffs on imports of US goods in retaliation for Trump\u2019s trade war\nBut the central bank is uncomfortably on hold. Trump\u2019s recently enacted tariffs, if they\u2019re kept in place, promise to have wide-ranging effects on the US economy. If those effects are higher inflation and rising unemployment, Fed officials will have to make some very tough choices. The central bank is tasked by Congress to both maximize employment and stabilize prices.\nIn such a scenario, Powell said officials will \u201clook at how far each of the two variables is from its goal\u201d and how long it would take to fix either one.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that\u2019s a difficult situation,\u201d he said.\nSo far, Trump has already put in place duties on metals and cars and doubled tariffs on China to 20%, on top of ones put in place during Trump\u2019s first term, which will be lifted even higher to well above 54%. China has already retaliated to Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nSentiment surveys have already captured America\u2019s unease with Trump\u2019s sweeping economic agenda: Consumer confidence in March plunged toits lowest level since January 2021and the small-business uncertainty about economy spiked in February toits second-highest on data going back to 1973.\n\u201cIf uncertainty persists or worsens, economic activity may be constrained,\u201d Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said Thursday at an event in Atlanta.\nPowell said the high level of uncertainty bedeviling America\u2019s decision makers should be \u201cmuch lower\u201d next year, after all the dust has settled from the Trump administration\u2019s massive policy shifts.\n\u201cThe actual effects of the policies should then be pretty manifested and clear,\u201d he said.\nPowell said the Fed\u2019s best move amid Trump\u2019s chaos is to keep rates on hold for longer. Fed officials convene again to set interest rate policy on May 6-7.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to wait and see how this plays out,\u201d Powell said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/04\/economy\/jerome-powell-fed-tariffs-jobs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The sharp drop in overall PPI was partly attributable to broader concerns that the global economy will slow because of that drastic shift in US trading policy.\nThe energy for final demand index sank 4% for the month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. Energy prices typically move higher this time of year; however, they moved lower last month because of a supply-demand imbalance as well as recession concerns weighing on crude oil prices.\nRelated articleThis key American business sector has a massive trade surplus with the rest of the world.

Excluding food and energy, categories that tend to be highly volatile, core PPI fell 0.1% from February (when it rose 0.1%), bringing the annual increase to 3.3%, its lowest rate since September.\nRelated live storyTrump\u2019s trade war escalates as China raises tariffs on US goods\nEgg prices paid to producers also dropped, reflecting some of the wholesale price declines that the US Department of Agriculture has noted in recent reports. Eggs for fresh use fell 21.3% in March but remain 165.4% higher from a year ago, according to the PPI data.\nWhile the PPI doesn\u2019t fully correlate to the prices consumers eventually pay, such a drop is an encouraging indication that egg prices could start to fall at the grocery store.\nPPI, which measures the average change in prices received by producers of goods and services, serves as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead. This index also is being scrutinized to glean insight as to the initial impacts ofTrump\u2019s sweeping new and proposed tariffs.\nMarch marked the second month that tariffs on Chinese goods were in effect (rising from 10% on all imports to 20% in early March); the global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports went into effect on March 12.\nIn April, Trump upped the ante on his tariff regime, including imposing an across-the-board 10% tariff on imports and a massive 145% duty on Chinese imports.\nFriday\u2019s PPI gave some hints as to how tariff-related price pressures could be percolating.\nWholesale iron and steel mill prices jumped 7.1% in March, logging the biggest monthly jump since April 2021, when supply chains were on the fritz amid the sharp pandemic recovery.\n\u201cMetals manufacturing prices were up sharply in the March PPI, a sign the steel and aluminum tariffs were starting to bite,\u201d Klachkin wrote. \u201cWith tariffs only ramping up further recently, we expect to see more passthrough in future PPI data.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/11\/economy\/us-producer-price-index-ppi-inflation-march","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s tariffs are inflicting serious economic damage and reigniting inflation, OECD says","date":"2025-03-17","body":"President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies are slowing economic growth in the United States and around the world while sending prices higher again, creating atoxic stewfor the global economy that could grow even worse if tensions escalate, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said Monday.\nThe quarterly report is the first sweeping attempt by global economists to document and forecast the damage from Trump\u2019s policies to the economies of America and its trading partners. The OECD report shows what US markets have been signaling for several weeks as they\u2019ve rapidlytumbled into correction territory: Trump\u2019s tariffs could choke the global economy and reignite inflation at a precarious time.\nMassive new import taxes on a variety of goods from a range of countries imposed by the Trump administration have been met withinstant retaliationfrom some of America\u2019s biggest trading partners. Threats of new tariffs and Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again levies have led to growing uncertainty for businesses around the world, preventing them from making investments that can drive economic growth, the OECD said. Meanwhile, fears of rebounding inflation from tariffs havedragged down consumer sentimentand spending, cutting off fuel for the US and global economies.\n\u201cIf the announced trade policy actions persist, as assumed in the projections, the new bilateral tariff rates will raise revenues for the governments imposing them but will be a drag on global activity, incomes and regular tax revenues,\u201d the OECD said. \u201cThey also add to trade costs, raising the price of covered imported final goods for consumers and intermediate inputs for businesses.\u201d\nThe group of 38 mostly wealthy nations made new economic forecasts that are noticeably worse than its previous predictions. The OECD predicted US economic growth would slow dramatically this year and next, to 2.2% in 2025 and just 1.6% in 2026. America\u2019s economy grew at a 2.8% rate last year. The global economy is expected to grow 3.1% this year and 3% next year, down from 3.2% growth in 2024.\nMeanwhile, US inflation will pick up this year, the OECD predicted. Prices are expected to rise 2.8% in 2025, up from 2.5% last year. They\u2019ll continue to be elevated in 2026, rising 2.6%, the OECD forecast.\nBoth growth and inflation forecasts are worse than in the previous quarterly report. The OECD previously expected US inflation to be just 2.1% this year, and it predicted US economic growth would be 2.4% in 2025. Global economic growth was expected to rise to 3.3% this year.\nBut Canada and particularly Mexico will fare significantly worse than the United States in the budding trade war. Trump has promised 25% across-the-board tariffs on America\u2019s neighbors and two of its three biggest trading partners \u2013 a move that could plunge both economies into a recession.\nThe OECD believes Canada\u2019s economic growth will be just 0.7% this year and next, far less than the prediction of 2% growth in the December report. And Mexico\u2019s economy is expected to shrink 1.3% this year and 0.6% in 2026 \u2013 a dramatic turn from the previous report, which predicted a 1.2% expansion in 2025 and 1.6% growth next year.\nHowever, China, another direct target of Trump\u2019s tariff policies, will prove more insulated than Mexico and Canada, the OECD predicts. The government, for example, just announced a wide-ranging\u201cspecial action plan\u201dto promote domestic spending, to counter the economic impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nCentral banks will have their work cut out for them. Although many around the world have been cutting interest rates to fuel growth after the inflation crisis has subsided, the OECD believes the inflation that tariffs will reignite means central banks will have to keep rates higher for longer, causing prolonged pain for businesses and consumers.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/17\/economy\/tariffs-oecd-forecast-economy-inflation","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2%, versus 0.5% in January.\nEconomists were expecting inflation to slow for the month amid falling gas prices and continued disinflation in housing-related costs. FactSet consensus estimates called for prices to rise 0.3% from January and 2.9% annually.\nUS stocks rallied Wednesday after the report was released, bouncing back afterthree weeks of declines.The Dow gained 140 points, or 0.3%, before dropping by around 300 points. The S&P 500 rose by 1.1% in early morning trading and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.9% higher, though both later pared those gains.\nFebruary\u2019s inflation numbers came in better than expected thanks in part to two big \u2014 and very welcome \u2014 reasons: Grocery prices were flat for the month and gas prices fell.\nConsumers got some relief on the egg front as well.\nEgg prices, which have soared because an ongoing bout of avian flu is ravaging the industry, rose 10.4% for the month, a cooler reading than the 15.2% increase logged in January. Still, egg prices remain high, up 58.8% from a year ago.\nThe US Department of Agriculturelast week notedthat negotiated wholesale prices for eggs \u201cdeclined sharply\u201d as outbreaks have slowed, providing some breathing room for unaffected producers to fill gaps in supply. The USDA noted that demand declined as well.\nFood and fuel are two of the most frequent ways that consumers encounter inflation, and those prices can fluctuate wildly on a month-by-month basis. That\u2019s due to factors such as weather, war, disease, supply chain snarls, spikes in demand or other temporary shocks.\nBecause of that, those categories are excluded in \u201ccore\u201d measurements meant to provide a sense of how underlying inflation is faring.\nFebruary\u2019s core CPI came in better than expected as well, rising 0.2% for the month (from 0.4% in January) and slowing to 3.1% annually from 3.2%.\nCore CPI is at its lowest annual rate in nearly four years.\n\u201cFamiliar problem areas,\u201d such as high, but slowing, housing-related inflation, continue to exert pressure on household budgets, noted Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.\n\u201cShelter costs are increasing at the slowest pace in more than three years but are still ahead of the increase in average hourly earnings over the past year,\u201d he wrote in commentary Wednesday. \u201cMotor vehicle insurance and repair, electricity, and natural gas continued to increase at an outsized pace in February. And egg prices are in a league of their own.\u201d\nStill, the softer inflation reading means that Americans wages are going even farther.\nWages have risen faster than inflation for 22 months now (they\u2019re running 1.2% faster as of February). However, they remain below the heights reached during the pandemic recovery.\nHowever, McBride, other analysts and economists on Wednesday expressed caution that the friendly February print may very well be the calm before the storm.\nRelated articleTrump imposes sweeping 25% steel and aluminum tariffs. Europe immediately retaliates\n\u201cGood news on the inflation fronts in February, but a cloud cover is on the horizon,\u201d Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University and chief economist at SS Economics, wrote Wednesday. \u201cLooking ahead, the inflation landscape has become increasingly uncertain as various economic factors begin to take effect. One of the key contributors is the impact of tariffs, which have started to influence consumer prices.\u201d\nA 10% tariff imposed on Chinese goods went into effect in February, and some retailers likely raised prices preemptively, Sohn noted.\nThe steel and aluminum tariffs as well as additional tariffs levied on Canada and Mexico are expected to drive up the prices of new and used vehicles. The impact is likely to be more pronounced in the March CPI data, Sohn noted.\nFood prices are also under pressure, he added.\n\u201cConsumers should prepare for significant increases in the cost of essential groceries, including eggs, baked goods and other groceries,\u201d Sohn said. \u201cSupply constraints, coupled with additional costs from tariffs, will push food prices higher and are expected to continue doing so in the coming months.\u201d\nThe tariff policy has been frenetic, making it challenging for consumers, businesses and economists to truly gauge potential impacts. As it stands now, Wells Fargo economists expect the headline CPI to increase to 3.2% by the third quarter.\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely a delta, probably closer to a percentage point higher of where we would be in the absence of all of this tariff policy,\u201d Nicole Cervi, Wells Fargo economist, told CNN in an interview.\nHowever, the underlying trends and ongoing disinflationary progress seen in sticky areas like services, particularly shelter, could help to offset some of the tariff-driven increases on the goods side of the equation, she said.\nThe Trump administration touted the positive report on Wednesday, saying \u201cthe economy is moving in the right direction under President Trump,\u201d according to a statement from the White House.\nReining in decades-high inflation was expected to be a slow and bumpy process. And readings have been a little choppy in recent months, prompting the central bankto take a more cautious approachto rate cuts in 2025.\nDespite some of the recent undulations, economists \u2014 and Fed Chair Jerome Powell \u2014 have noted that the underlying data continues to show that the pace of price hikes is slowing.\nFebruary\u2019s report is a clear example of the progress that has been long underway, Cervi said.\n\u201cMy colleague Sarah House has a good phrase on this: \u2018Inflation is a process,\u2019\u201d Cervi said. \u201cA lot of it is reflecting past business decisions and how that\u2019s being reflected in prices.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be difficult to say that this print in particular is a reflection of what\u2019s going on in the real economy today,\u201d she added.\nPlus, a good chunk of the CPI is a very lagged indicator of what\u2019s happening in critical parts of the economy.\nShelter, which accounts for more than one-third of the overall CPI, has been the biggest impediment to inflation\u2019s descent.\nBLS\u2019 measurement of housing-related prices is avery lagged and amorphous process(including estimating the rental value of owner-occupied homes). But in recent months, the shelter index has better reflected the slower, if not flator falling, rent hikes seen in real life.\nIn February, shelter inflation slowed to an annual rate of 4.2%, its lowest since December 2021.\n\u201cThe moderation that we\u2019re seeing in shelter, a lot of that is reflecting rental price deceleration that we saw last year, even toward the end of 2023,\u201d she said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/12\/economy\/us-cpi-consumer-inflation-february","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"US wholesale inflation substantially slowed in February","date":"2025-03-13","body":"Americans just got some reassurances that inflation was slowing, and not reaccelerating, last month.\nThe Producer Price Index, a wholesale inflation gauge that is being closely watched for tariff-related impacts, showed that price hikes slowed substantially in February.\nThe PPI index was unchanged from January, and rose 3.2% for the 12 months ended in February, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday. That marked asharp slowdown from January, when prices rose 0.6% and 3.7% for those respective periods.\nEconomists were expecting wholesale-level inflation to cool amid falling energy prices, and that was the case: Energy prices fell 1.2% for the month.\nExcluding food and energy, categories that tend to be volatile, core PPI fell 0.1% from January (when it sharply rose 0.6%), bringing the annual increase to 3.4%, down from a 3.8% rate the month before.\n\u201cAfter hotter readings in December and January, flat producer prices for February should provide some assurances that inflation isn\u2019t taking off again,\u201d Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide, wrote in commentary issued Thursday. \u201cBut one month does not make a trend, and the upward pressure for goods costs (even excluding the outsized increase for eggs) is a warning sign that imposed tariffs could drive prices higher in coming months.\u201d\nThe latest Consumer Price Index, released Wednesday, showed annual inflation slowed for the first time in five months.\nRelated articleHow Trump\u2019s trade war could quickly spiral out of control\nPPI, which measures the average change in prices paid to producers of goods and services, serves as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead. This index also is being scrutinized to glean insight as to the initial impacts of PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s sweeping new and proposed tariffs.\nWholesale goods prices rose 0.3% for the month, an increase that was fueled largely by sharp inflation in eggs but offset by falling energy prices.Egg inflation is slowingon the wholesale level, but prices remain significantly higher than last year as a deadly avian flu has devastated flocks and impacted supply.\nThe eggs for fresh use index rose 28.1% on a monthly basis, slowing from 44% in January. On an annual basis, the category is up 136.6%.\nExcluding food and energy, final demand goods rose 0.4%.\n\u201cThe fastest increase since January 2023, presumably as tariff effects began to flow into input costs for producers,\u201d Ayers noted. \u201cWith tariffs on steel, aluminum and some products from Mexico and Canada enacted in March, the goods category could jump higher soon.\u201d\nIncreases in wholesale good prices could reflect not just the direct impact from tariffs but also producers raising prices in anticipation of \u201ctrade war fallout,\u201d said Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet\u2019s senior economist.\n\u201cBusinesses, like consumers, don\u2019t necessarily wait for direct impact before taking action,\u201d she wrote Thursday. \u201cFor example, if you\u2019re fairly confident prices on televisions are going to rise in coming months, you might upgrade now rather than wait. Likewise, businesses may increase inventories and wholesalers may raise prices, all in an effort to beat the real changes to the punch.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIn this way, tariffs and other inflationary policies can shape the economy before they\u2019re even implemented.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s PPI, like CPI before it, is another data series reflecting \u201cthe calm before the storm,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US, told CNN in an interview.\n\u201cWe know that it\u2019s going to be passed through,\u201d he said of higher tariffs paid by US importers. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to show up, but it\u2019s going to be a multi-month phenomenon, and February was not the month that it was going to happen.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/13\/economy\/us-ppi-producer-inflation-february","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Americans are getting fed up with the economy. Does that mean we\u2019re heading into a recession?","date":"2025-02-26","body":"American consumers and businessesare feeling uneasy, fearing higher inflation is lurking around the corner as President Donald Trump talks massive tariffs. That\u2019s raising questions on what America\u2019s souring economic mood means for spending, hiring and the future of the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\u201cThe kinds of changes that are occurring under Trump are arguably unprecedented, and it\u2019s making people very nervous,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s, told CNN. \u201cIf confidence continues to fall for another three months, and consumers actually pack it in, then game over.\u201d\nInflation fears, due to Trump\u2019s tariffs, areputting America on edge, according to various surveys: Consumer confidence fell sharply in February, registering its sharpest monthly decline since August 2021, The Conference Board said Tuesday. The National Federation of Independent Business, which has been collecting data since 1973, reported its third-highest reading ever on its Uncertainty Index for January.\nPessimism is also becoming apparent on Wall Street. Investor sentiment on Tuesday shifted into \u201cextreme fear,\u201dwhich hasn\u2019t happened since December, according toCNN\u2019s Fear & Greed Index.\nBut gloomier attitudes don\u2019t usually lead toa pullback in spending, according to economists. For instance, in June 2022, when consumer sentiment plunged to a record low as inflation reached a four-decade high, American shoppers continued to spend in the following months.\nBut souring attitudes this time around, driven by uncertainty sowed by the Trump administration, could actually weigh on the economy if they persist.\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too premature to conclude that recession dynamics are starting to take hold, but this could be a unique time when uncertainty does upend sentiment, and actually causes consumers to pull back,\u201d Zandi said.\nConsumer spending accounts forabout 70% of the US economy, and retail sales account for about a third of overall spending. So if Americans continue to spend at a healthy pace, there is likely no recession taking shape.\nAlthough there haven\u2019t been signs of a consumer pullback, the latest data on retail spending wasn\u2019t encouraging.\nRetail sales fell0.9% in Januaryfrom the prior month, according to Commerce Department data, the first monthly decline since August 2024. Economists said the weaker-than-expected figure was likelydue to unseasonably cold weatherthat forced shoppers to hunker down, rather than a sign of the American shopper tapping out.\nThe Commerce Department will release fuller figures on consumer spending Friday.\nWalmart, America\u2019s largest retailer,warned last weekthat its sales and profit growth couldslow this year. Years of high inflation and elevated borrowing costs have strained some consumers,especially those with low incomes.\n\u201cI think the economy is weakening,\u201d Tony James, former president of asset manager Blackstone, told CNBC Wednesday. \u201cAt the same time, I think the uncertainty out of Washington is causing businesses to slow down.\u201d\nJames, who is chairman of Costco\u2019s board of directors, pointed to rising delinquencies and the \u201cnarrowing base\u201d of consumers driving spending, in addition to weakening consumer confidence.\nBut others believe Americans consumers can still power the economy with their spending in the coming months.\n\u201cThe better correlation with spending is with consumer income and the overall health of the job market,\u201d said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, who said he doesn\u2019t see a recession unfolding this year.\nAmerica\u2019s job market overall remains in good shape,with unemployment at 4%and average hourly earnings continuing to grow, Labor Department data shows.\nThat bodes well for spending, but the layoffs of federal workers could spook consumers to cut back.\n\u201cWhen layoffs hit close to home, people start getting nervous,\u201d Frick said.\nThe Trump administration, at the direction of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, has begun to pare back the federal government\u2019scivilian workforceof more than 3 million people. The federal civilian workforce represents less than 2% of the 170.7 million total jobs in the United States, and expertstold CNN previouslythat those layoffs likely won\u2019t topple the resilient US labor market.\n\u201cWe do expect to see a slight rise in the unemployment rate later this year, but mostly holding steady,\u201d said Grace Zwemmer, senior economist at Oxford Economics.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/02\/26\/economy\/recession-coming-trump-us-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"If Trump wants to fix the inflation crisis, he has a funny way of showing it","date":"2025-02-24","body":"Inflation appeared nearly defeated just a few months ago, butprice hikes started accelerating again, led in particular by rising egg prices and fuel costs. A nation that has grown weary of inflation has turned its hopes to President Donald Trump to help fix its affordability crisis.\nBut Trump, who had campaigned on bringing prices down on Day One of his presidency, has instead focused his economic policy thus far on tariffs \u2013 also known as higher taxes. Tariffs are paid by American importers, who typically pass those costs onto retailers, who, in turn, jack up the prices that consumers end up paying.\nFearful that Trump\u2019s tariffs will only exacerbate inflation, Americans are already beginning tosour on Trump\u2019s economic plan.\n\u201cThe public\u2019s fears have soared in just the last two weeks showing the blizzard of changes coming from the president\u2019s desk have spilled over the line between pro-growth into the realm of pro-inflation,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBonds, in a note to investors Sunday. \u201cOnce inflation expectations start moving higher it is only a matter of time before actual inflation takes off.\u201d\nTheUniversity of Michigan\u2019s latest survey, released Friday, showed that US consumer sentiment declined in February for the second consecutive month, falling by a steep 10% from January. The survey found that Americans are losing confidence in the economy, driven primarily by worries over Trump\u2019s tariffs potentially boosting inflation.\nA new CNN poll released last Thursday similarly showedpessimism on the risebecause of prices: Nearly two-thirds of US adults nationwide, 62%, said they feel Trump isn\u2019t doing enough to address inflation.\nLast week, investors grew fearful that the weakening consumer sentiment could lead to a pullback in Americans\u2019 shopping habits. The stock market had its worst week of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 theDow lost 1,200 pointsover the course of Thursday and Friday \u2013 though it was poised to rebound somewhat Monday.\nWalmart warnedlast week that consumers\u2019 negativity about the economy would weigh on sales this coming year. That\u2019s a potential problem for the economy: Consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of America\u2019s gross domestic product.\nTrump can\u2019t shoulder much if any of the blame for inflation. Not just yet, anyway. The most recent consumer inflation report showed pricesrose 0.5% last monthcompared to December \u2014 the fastest monthly increase since August 2023. Trump was president for just 11 \u00bd of the 31 days covered in the report.\nBut inflation is becoming Trump\u2019s problem, and consumers\u2019 fears for a reignited inflation crisis threaten to bring the honeymoon period for Trump\u2019s second term to an abrupt end. And if consumers rein in their spending, that could lead the economy \u2013 currently nowhere close to a recession \u2013 into some problems.\n\u201cIf the consumer balks at the higher prices coming their way, the economy could collapse in a hurry,\u201d Rupkey said. \u201cBet on it.\u201d\nThat could be particularly true if Trump follows through with his massive tariffs threats that could begin early next month.\nTrump has already imposed a10% across-the-board tariff on Chinese goodscoming into the United States. Tariffs are aimed at raising revenue, bringing foreign countries to the negotiating table, narrowing the trade gap and restoring American manufacturing.\nApple, facing expensive Chinese tariffs, made a substantial commitment Monday morning to invest $500 billion in US facilities over the next four years that could help it bypass some of those burdens.\nBut not every company can make those kinds of commitments \u2013 particularly if they have expensive legacy operations in former free trade zones, or if they make products overseas that can\u2019t easily be made in the United States.\nEarly next month, the Trump administration is set to impose delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, ending the policy of free trade that he continued during his first term, when he signed the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that he championed.\nThe 25% across-the-board tariffs (and 10% on Canadian energy), if they go into effect, threaten to raise the prices on cars, lumber, fuel, produce and many other goods. And both Canada and Mexico have threatened to retaliate against America with tariffs of their own, potentially hurting US industry.\nMeanwhile, expandedsteel and aluminum tariffsare set to go into effect in a few weeks. And the Trump administration has floated reciprocal tariffs on autos, lumber, pharmaceuticals, microchips and potentially some other products, matching dollar-for-dollar what other countries charge the United States. That new policy remains under review and could go into effect as soon as April 2, Trump has promised.\nIf Trump makes good on his most severe tariff threats \u2013 across-the-board tariffs on all manner of goods, the policy threatens to widen America\u2019s rich-poor divide, said Michael Pearce, deputy chief US economist at Oxford Economics. Because the tariffs would be placed on goods indiscriminately, it would boost the cost of food, shelter, clothing and other necessities that would make it harder for the people who can afford it least to change their purchasing behavior.\n\u201cBecause low-income consumers spend a disproportionate share of their income on non-discretionary goods, the increased consumer prices due to tariffs will weigh more on them,\u201d Pearce said in a recent report. \u201cThat will reinforce the trend of a bifurcated US consumer, with spending by high-income households continuing to grow at a rapid pace while low-income consumers struggle.\u201d\nMicrochips are in practically everything now, and they have thepotential to raise priceson much more than phones and computers \u2013 cars, refrigerators, thermostats, and many other household items could become more expensive.\nLumber in particular could exacerbate one of the most persistent causes of inflation: the stuck housing market. The United States doesn\u2019t have enough housing supply to meet demand, and raising prices on a key structural component for homebuilding could raise building costs.\nTrump, for his part, hasacknowledged that inflation remains a problem. But he has deflected blame to former President Joe Biden.\n\u201cInflation is back,\u201d Trump said last week in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. \u201cI had nothing to do with it. These people have \u2013 have run the country. They spent money like nobody has ever spent.\u201d\nEconomistsdisagree about why, exactly, inflation surgedafter Biden became president before coming back down to near-normal levels. But prices have remained stubbornly high as bird flu boosted egg prices at the fastest rate in 10 years last month and a combination of slumping demand and sanctions on Russia and Iran continued to raise fuel prices. Prices were up across the board last month, though \u2013 not just in those volatile and hard-to-control categories like food and fuel.\nThe president and his advisers have spelled out a plan to lower prices for Americans, which includes a combination of tax cuts, deregulation of energy and cutting government spending \u2013 mostly in the form of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.\nHowever, tax cuts would almost certainly increase US borrowing, because tariffs and cuts to government spending probablycannot replace all the revenueAmerica would lose from cutting taxes.\nOil and gas deregulation has been met with skepticism from the energy industry, because fuel demand is in a slump, and drilling for more oil and gas may not be profitable.\nAnd returning savings from government cost cutting directly to taxpayers, as Trump has proposed,could itself reignite inflation, because consumers tend to spend money when you hand it to them. Kevin Hassett, an economic adviser to Trump, denied that last week, arguing taxpayers would pad their savings with stimulus checks.\nSoTrump has a planto combat high prices. But it\u2019s a problematic solution that could be undone by tariffs.\nIf it doesn\u2019t work, Trump\u2019s favorability could erode. It already has.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/02\/24\/economy\/trump-inflation-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

It\u2019s been a month since he took office and he has yet to deliver.\nConsumer pricesrose 0.5% last monthcompared to December \u2014 the fastest monthly increase in prices since August 2023, according to Consumer Price Index data. And it could soon get even worse withwholesale prices remaining elevated, often a precursor to higher consumer prices.\nThe pain is most acute at the grocery store, where consumers are confrontingsoaring egg prices\u2014 if they\u2019re lucky enough to come across any eggs \u2014 due to avian flu outbreaks nationwide. And despite Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d to bring gas prices down, Americans are paying four cents more for a gallon of regular fuel on average than when he returned to the White House on January 20, according to AAA data.\nUnsurprisingly, Americans aren\u2019t pleased. Anew CNN pollshows 62% of Americans feel Trump hasn\u2019t done enough to tackle inflation. Nearly the same share of Americans view inflation as \u201ca very big problem,\u201d according to a Pew Research poll published on Thursday.\nTo be fair, it was probably unrealistic to expect prices would come down immediately once Trump was back in the Oval Office. And, frankly, it would have been a huge concern if priceshadplunged right away.\nBut, as Vice President JD Vance said in a CBS News interview last month, \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day.\u201d\n\u201cConsumers are going to see lower prices at the pump and at the grocery store, but it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time,\u201d he added. Translation: My boss misspoke previously.\nHe has a point \u2014 barring black swan events like a global pandemic, economies don\u2019t tend to significantly reverse course overnight. And, in fact, if prices did manage to come down as rapidly as Trump promised, it likely would mean the economy hadbigger problems on its hands.\nRelated articleTrump acknowledges \u2018inflation is back\u2019 but blames Biden\nThe other approach Trump and his administration are employing when asked why prices aren\u2019t coming down is a politician\u2019s tried and true playbook: blame your predecessor.\n\u201cBIDEN INFLATION UP!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social last week after January inflation figures were released.\n\u201cIf Joe Biden had simply held federal spending at the pre-pandemic levels we had in 2019, we right now, we would have virtually no inflation,\u201d Trump told attendees at the FII Priority Summit in Miami on Wednesday.\nBut fear not: \u201cWe\u2019re addressing inflation,\u201d Trump\u2019s top economist, Kevin Hassett, who leads the National Economic Council, told reporters during a White House press briefing on Thursday.\n\u201cAnd how are we doing it? Well, we\u2019re doing it with a plan that President Trump and I and others have talked about in the Oval that involves, like, every level of fighting inflation.\u201d\nThat plan \u2014 or to use Trump\u2019s verbiage, concept of a plan \u2014 involves cutting government spending and \u201csupply-side things,\u201d Hassett said. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to see some memory of Biden\u2019s inflation \u2014 it\u2019s not going to go away in a month,\u201d he added.\nTrump has outlined an inflation-reduction plan that involves a combination of cutting taxes, ramping up energy drilling leases and unleashing DOGE to cut spending (and, perhaps, share some of thatdirectly with taxpayers). But tax cuts could worsen America\u2019s debt load and drive borrowing costs even higher, energy companies are not jumping at the chance to drill more while demand slumps, and writing stimulus checks could overheat the economy \u2014 and reignite inflation.\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai defended Trump\u2019s promise to bring down prices immediately, telling CNN that \u201cwithin hours of assuming office, President Trump took immediate executive action to deliver economic relief for everyday Americans by unleashing American energy, slashing costly regulations, and reining in runaway government spending.\u201d\nIn general, most economists would agree: One month is not a meaningful length of time to judge how a nation\u2019s economy is faring. Rather, they tend to prefer to analyze several months\u2019 worth of data to shake out one-month blips from longer-lasting trends.\nSimilarly, it would be reasonable to wait several months before assessing whether Trump\u2019s policies have had a positive or negative impact on inflation. After all, it took more than two years for inflation to cool from a four-decade high of just over 9% in 2022 to a level that is now just shy of the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.\nBut Trump forfeited that grace period the moment he promised immediate relief \u2014 which Americans have yet to see.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/02\/21\/economy\/us-economy-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"US consumer sentiment plunges over tariff and inflation fears","date":"2025-02-21","body":"Inflation is picking up again and President Donald Trump said this weekit\u2019s all his predecessor\u2019s fault. But no matter who Trump blames for inflation, America\u2019s economic mood is now souring \u2014 and Trump is getting the heat for it.\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s latest survey, released Friday, showed that US consumer sentiment declined in February for the second consecutive month, according to a final reading, down by a steep 10% from January. That was double the decline initially reported earlier this month.\nIt\u2019s a stunning about-face after American consumers and businesses grew hopeful (briefly) about the economy\u2019s future following Trump\u2019s election in November. The latest decline in consumer sentiment was driven by worries over Trump\u2019s tariffs potentially jacking up prices.\nA new CNN poll released Thursday similarly showedpessimism on the risebecause of prices: Nearly two thirds of US adults nationwide, 62%, said they feel Trump\u2019s isn\u2019t doing enough to address inflation. The Michigan survey showed that Americans are now fearful of higher inflation on the horizon.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised to \u201cbring down prices, starting on Day One.\u201d Clearly, that didn\u2019t happen. In January, consumer prices climbed atthe fastest monthly pace since August 2023, increasing 0.5% from December.\nJoanne Hsu, the Michigan survey\u2019s director, said in a release that the broad decline was \u201cin large part due to fears that tariff-induced price increases are imminent.\u201d\nBut changes in sentiment are beginning to diverge based on political affiliation.\n\u201cWhile sentiment fell for both Democrats and Independents, it was unchanged for Republicans, reflecting continued disagreements on the consequences of new economic policies,\u201d she said.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s aggressive approach to tariffs is a key reason why attitudes about the economy are souring, according to various consumer surveys and polls.\nSo far, the administration has implemented 10% across-the-board tariffs on all Chinese goods and announced 25% tariffson all steel and aluminum imports, with no exceptions. It is also studying how best to apply\u201creciprocal tariffs\u201don America\u2019s trading partners, which could come in early April. Trump is also keeping 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada on the table, as soon as next month, a move that economists say would likely stoke inflation.\n\u201cThe economy faces heightened uncertainty,\u201d Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in an essay published Thursday. \u201cAtrade policy uncertainty indexby a group of Federal Reserve economists has surged past its historic peak.\u201d\nAll the drama around tariffs has affected Americans\u2019 perception of prices: Expectations for inflation in the year ahead surged this month to 4.3%, according to the Michigan survey, up a full percentage point from January to the highest level since November 2023. On a call with reporters Thursday, Bostic said \u201cwe\u2019re going to pay attention to all\u201d measures of inflation expectations.\nThe Federal Reserve, tasked with managing interest rates, keeps a close eye on consumer perceptions of prices because they can sometimes be self fulfilling, so if consumers expect inflation to pick up, they could modify their spending.\nBut the Fed doesn\u2019t have a nightmare on its hands just yet. Central bankers specifically focus on longer-run inflation expectations, which didn\u2019t rise this month as much as the short-run expectations figure did, up to 3.5% in February from 3.2% in January. But it was higher than the figure initially reported.\n\u201cThese days, higher tariffs and immigration policies are often discussed and thought likely to increase prices, cool aggregate demand and possibly soften employment. From the standpoint of monetary policy, it could be appropriate to ignore or look through an increase in the price level if the impact on inflation is expected to be brief and limited,\u201d St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said Thursday at an event in New York. \u201cHowever, a different monetary policy response could be appropriate if higher inflation is sustained, or long term inflation expectations rise.\u201d\nThe closely watched Consumer Price Index rose 3% in January from a year earlier, the Labor Department said last week, the fastest annual pace since the summer of 2024.\nIn an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity that aired Tuesday, Trump said \u201cinflation is back,\u201d blaming the latest uptick on government spending during the Biden administration. To be fair, Trump doesn\u2019t shoulder much of the blame, since he occupied the Oval Office for less than half of the days covered by the latest inflation report.\nThe latest episode of high inflation undoubtedly occurred on former President Joe Biden\u2019s watch.\n\u201cI had nothing to do with it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese people have \u2014 have run the country. They spent money like nobody has ever spent.\u201d\nBut inflation is now Trump\u2019s problem.\nAnd some economists have pointed to the role that the government\u2019s spending played in heating up the economy after the pandemic \u2014 trillions of dollars for Covid relief and infrastructure projects \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t the sole reason why inflation surged. In reality, it was a combination of factors, such as pandemic shocks to supply and demand and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\u201cPent-up demand, stimulative policies, pandemic changes in work and leisure practices, and the additional savings associated with constrained services spending all contributed to a historic surge in consumer spending on goods.

During the pandemic,more than 476 million payments totaling $814 billion went out to households.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first presidential term, qualifying Americans received $1,200 in March 2020 and $600 in December 2020. When former President Joe Biden assumed office in March 2021, another round of relief checks totaling $1,400 was sent out.\nJust over one year after the final payments were sent, consumer prices in the US hit a 41-year high.\nWhile multiple factors have led to America\u2019s recent bout of inflation \u2014 including supply chain disruptions, pandemic-induced demand shifts and Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine \u2014 some economists blamed substantial government spending for overheating the economy.\nResearchers at the St. Louis Fedestimatedthat government stimulus was responsible for 2.6 percentage points of the 7.9% annual inflation rate recorded in February 2022.\n\u201cGenerous fiscal support contributed to an increase in the demand for consumption goods during the pandemic, but industrial production did not adjust quickly enough to meet the sharp increase in demand,\u201d St. Louis Fed researchers wrote.\nWhile the US economy is in a very different place than it was in the months after the pandemic when people stayed home and many businesses ground to a halt, the Fed is still battling post-pandemic inflation.\nConsumer prices rosea half percentage point in January alone, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But he said the Biden administration\u2019s runaway spending is to blame.\n\u201cInflation is back,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI had nothing to do with it. These people have \u2014 have run the country. They spent money like nobody has ever spent.\u201d\nTrump is right about the return of inflation: Consumer pricesrose much more than expectedlast month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week \u2014 buoyed in particular by surging fuel and egg prices. January marked the biggest monthly increase since August 2023. And prices were 3% higher year-over-year for the first time since June 2024.\nThe president is also right that he can\u2019t shoulder much of the blame: Former President Joe Biden occupied the Oval Office for 19 \u00bd of the 31 days covered by the most recent report.\nBut Trump\u2019s argument that Biden is to blame for inflation is up for debate. Economistsdisagree about why, exactly, inflation surgedafter Biden became president before coming back down to near-normal levels. Prices rose throughout Biden\u2019s first year in office and inflation spiked in his second year, reaching a 40-year high in June 2022 before falling.\nRelated articleTrump has a plan to lower inflation. It\u2019s just delayed\nTrump on Tuesday night appeared to blame inflation on Biden\u2019s push for a \u201cGreen New Scam,\u201d although it wasn\u2019t exactly clear what his claim referred to. No such bill ever passed.\n\u201cThey were given $9 trillion to throw out the window \u2014 $9 trillion, and they spent it on the Green New Scam, I call it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest scam in the history of the country.\u201d\nBiden signed aninfrastructure billthat included green energy projects and cost more than $1 trillion in 2021 andCovid reliefthat totaled $3.4 trillion. Combined, they added roughly $5 trillion to the deficit in his first two years, according to theCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Biden\u2019s signature Inflation Reduction Act, which also included a combination of tax credits and spending, actually saved the government $240 billion because of increased tax enforcement and prescription drug savings, according to the CRFB. Republicans took over the House of Representatives in 2023, and Biden did not pass any substantial legislation in his last two years in office.\nSome economists, including former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, have in part blamed the substantial spending for overheating the economy.\n\u201cThe US response to the COVID-19 pandemic included a series of federal initiatives, notably the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan, which collectively authorized roughly $5 trillion in government spending,\u201d noted the authors of a September 2023 National Bureau of Economic Researchreport.\u201cThese programs contributed to strong consumer and business demand, which tightened labor markets (between mid-2021 and early 2022 the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers doubled), putting upward pressure on wages and prices.\u201d\nBut the same report also blamed the price hikes on factors including higher production costs linked to swings in demand, the war in Ukraine and Covid-era supply trouble.\nThe BLS in a January 2023reportblamed inflation on \u201cvolatility of energy prices, backlogs of work orders for goods and services caused by supply chain issues due to COVID-19, and price changes in the auto-related industries.\u201d\nAnd the International Monetary Fund said in a September 2024reportthat macroeconomic effects like federal spending weren\u2019t to blame at all \u2014 instead it was just old-fashioned supply and demand.\nSo the jury is decidedly out on how much federal spending contributed to inflation \u2014 if at all. Trump may be right that the Biden administration spent too much at the wrong time. But economists agree that alone didn\u2019t cause inflation to spike.\nPeter Navarro joins The Lead\nRelated videoTrump says tariffs could cause short-term price increases\nAnd it certainly isn\u2019t what\u2019s driving prices higher now. Prices have remained stubbornly high as bird flu boosted egg prices at the fastest rate in 10 years and a combination of slumping demand and sanctions on Russia and Iran continued to raise fuel prices.\nPrices were up across the board last month, though \u2014 not just those volatile and hard-to-control categories like food and fuel. That will almost certainly halt the Fed\u2019s efforts to lower interest rates, keeping the cost of borrowing high for American consumers and homebuyers \u2014 and mortgages and rents have been a persistent source of inflation.\nAnother thing that won\u2019t help prices: Trump\u2019s tariffs. Raising taxes on imports will ultimately cost the American consumers who will be left footing the bill, economists largely agree. That could negatesavings realized from his plansto cut spending, cut taxes and increase fossil fuel drilling licenses.\nSo Biden may have contributed to America\u2019s stubborn inflation problem. But it\u2019s now Trump\u2019s problem, and his most prominent economic policy may make it worse.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/02\/19\/economy\/trump-inflation-is-back","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

On an annual basis, core PPI cooled to 3.6% from 3.7% the month prior.\nFood and energy categories are typically quite volatile \u2014 and can be heavily influenced by temporary or one-time events such as weather, disease, war and supply chain hiccups \u2014 so economists and analysts look to core gauges to get a read on underlying inflation trends.\nHowever, food and energy are two areas that people and businesses cannot avoid in their everyday lives. And increases on these fronts hit lower-income Americans the hardest.\n\u201cInflation at the producer level remains high, and one concern is that this inflation could ultimately be passed along to consumers,\u201d Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, wrote Thursday.\n\u201cThursday\u2019s stronger-than-expected PPI helps to confirm, especially after Wednesday\u2019s hot CPI, that inflation did indeed come roaring back in January, and makes the Federal Reserve\u2019s path much clearer, since there is arguably zero reason to cut interest rates right now,\u201d Paul Stanley, chief investment officer of Granite Bay Wealth Management, wrote in commentary on Thursday.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/02\/13\/economy\/us-ppi-producer-wholesale-inflation-january","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

That\u2019s because inflation expectations can sometimes be self fulfilling, so if consumers expect inflation to pick up, they could modify their spending.\nThe Fed focuses specifically on longer-term inflation expectations, based on various surveys and measures, including the closely watched Michigan survey. That latest figure wasn\u2019t as unsettling as the year-ahead one: Long-term inflation expectations edged higher this month to 3.3% from January\u2019s 3.2%, remaining \u201celevated relative to the 2.2-2.6% range seen in the two years pre-pandemic.\u201d\nIn 2018, after the first Trump administration slapped tariffs on various goods, Fed economists devised simulations on the appropriate path for monetary policy based on different tariff scenarios.

{"title":"Wholesale inflation heated up less than expected last month","date":"2025-01-14","body":"There appears to be some welcome news on the US inflation front.\nPrice hikes on the wholesale level were much tamer than anticipated in December, according to the latest Producer Price Index released Tuesday, indicating that inflation might not be reaccelerating as much as feared.\nHowever, Tuesday\u2019s positive PPI report may merely be \u201cthe calm before the storm,\u201d cautioned economist Chris Rupkey at FwdBonds. President-elect Donald Trump hasthreatened to unleasha series of steep tariffs on key US trading partners, stoking fears that higher costswill be passed along to American consumers.\n\u201cA small victory today on the inflation front, and it is the incoming president-elect\u2019s policies that can either continue the progress on inflation or worsen it,\u201d Rupkey wrote in commentary issued Tuesday.\nIn December, the Producer Price Index, which measures the average change in prices paid to US-based producers for goods and services, rose 0.2% from the month before and 3.3% for the year ended in December, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Tuesday.\nRelated articleAmericans may have to actually brace for stagflation with Trump tariffs\nA surge in energy costs was the culprit behind the monthly increase, according to the report. Wholesale energy prices rose 3.5% for the month (fueled by a 9.7% jump in gas prices) driving goods prices and the overall index higher.\nIn November,prices rose 0.4% for the month\u2014 driven higher in part bysoaring egg prices\u2014 and 3% annually.\nA closely watched measure of underlying inflation didn\u2019t budge much at all in December: Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, held flat from November and held pat at 3.5% annually.\nAlthough PPI\u2019s annual rate is at its highest point since February 2023, prices didn\u2019t rise as much as anticipated: Economists were expecting PPI to rise 0.3% on a monthly basis and move to 3.4% annually.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly seen a rebound in PPI inflation from the lows that we experienced in early 2024; but generally speaking, core PPI inflation and headline PPI inflation is still within the range that was in place before the pandemic,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon told CNN Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s still very encouraging in terms of fundamental inflation pressures being still quite contained.\u201d\nPPI captures average price shifts before they reach consumers and serves as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead.\nMonthly data can be quite volatile, but Tuesday\u2019s PPI report showed that some relief may be coming consumers\u2019 way on the egg front.\nIn December, wholesale prices of eggs for fresh use rose just 0.5% from the month before. They had soared 55.6% in November.\nA highly contagious and deadly bird flu has devastated chicken farms,leading to egg shortagesand higher prices for consumers. Those issues were exacerbated during the recent holiday season when eggs are in higher demand.\nThe average price of a dozen eggs of any kind at the end of December was $4.33, up nearly 25% from the beginning of November, according to Nielsen IQ data provided by the American Egg Board. And that\u2019s on top of what has already been a startling rise throughout the year:Egg prices were up 37.5% year-over-year in November, according to the Consumer Price Index for that month.\nThe December CPI is due out Wednesday morning and is expected to reflect some of the 55.6% egg price surge seen by producers in November, EY-Parthenon\u2019s Daco said.\n\u201cIt will be a pressure point for CPI [Wednesday],\u201d Daco said of the inflation gauge that captures prices changes for a broad basket of goods and services commonly purchased by consumers.\nEconomists expect the December CPI to rise 0.3% on a monthly basis, similar to the pace seen in November, and for the annual rate to nudge 0.1 percentage points higher to 2.8%, according to FactSet consensus estimates.\n\u201cThe December data is likely to be carried by higher energy prices, higher egg prices and then potentially a little bit of a rebound \u2014 nothing major, nothing alarming \u2014 but a little higher shelter cost of inflation than what we\u2019ve seen in the past,\u201d he said.\nBut for consumers, based on what PPI is showing, those price shocks could be easing in the near future, he added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like those egg prices are going to rise at an increased pace forever,\u201d Daco said. \u201cYou get the increase in prices once, and that\u2019s really a reset in prices. But you don\u2019t get it month after month after month.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Vanessa Yurkevich contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/14\/economy\/us-ppi-producer-wholesale-inflation-december","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Crypto remains on edge. That could be bad news for the stock market","date":"2025-12-01","body":"Crypto had arough November. The pain is persisting into December \u2014 and that could signal trouble ahead for the stock market.\nBitcoin has slumped more than 6% in the past 24 hours, sliding from just above $91,000 to roughly $85,600 as of Monday afternoon. The cryptocurrency sold off sharply late Sunday \u2014 tumbling more than $4,000 in just a few hours \u2014 as December trading kicked off in Asia.\nBitcoin has seen intense swings in recent weeks asrisk-off sentimenthas spread through markets. In addition to a risk-averse mood, the latest freakout in the crypto world stems from concerns about the unwinding of a popular trading strategy.\nSo, what\u2019s going on?\nThe Bank of Japan has signaled it could raise interest rates at its policy meeting later this month. That is throwing a wrench into a trading strategy that relies on borrowing relatively cheap Japanese yen.\nFor years, a lucrative trade for global investors has been to borrow yen to buy high-yielding assets like US stocks, or in this case, cryptocurrencies. Interest rates in Japan had been low or at zero, making borrowing yen relatively cheap and creating a sweet opportunity for traders. It\u2019s known as the \u201cyen carry trade.\u201d\nHowever, the Bank of Japan has signaled it could raise interest rates, in part to address stubborn inflation, continuing a recent shift away from years of ultra-low rates. Yields on benchmark Japanese bonds just hit their highest level since 2008, signaling expectations for higher rates. As rates in Japan rise, it can boost the value of the yen. That makes borrowing yen less affordable, eating into the profitability of the carry trade.\nThat could pressure traders to sell their bitcoin and stocks now to repay their loans and prevent the risk of further losses. In addition to a sell-off, it could lead to less cash flowing into crypto and stocks.\n\u201cThis raises questions about the unwinding of the yen carry trade \u2026 which would drain liquidity from the system,\u201d Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, said in a note. \u201cThat would not be good for the stock market.\u201d\nBitcoin dipped below $84,000 Monday morning before paring some losses in the afternoon. US stocks closed lower: The Dow fell 427 points, or 0.9%. The S&P 500 fell 0.53%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.38%.\nFor crypto, the sell-off has been widespread: Ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has tumbled almost 9% in the past 24 hours.\nBitcoin\u2019s tumble comes on the heels of asteep sell-offin crypto markets just weeks ago. Bitcoin in late November fell to just above $80,000 \u2014 down roughly 35% from a record high above $126,000 in early October.\nThe slide in bitcoin led stocks lower and, in particular, thetech stocksthat had been carrying the market. The S&P 500 fell almost 5% at one point in November before rallying and slighting gaining for the month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its first losing month since March.\nMarkets are \u201cnot out of the woods quite yet,\u201d Maley said.\n\u201cThe renewed decline in bitcoin could create some real problems for the stock market,\u201d he said in a note. \u201cIf the issues which are creating this decline do not subside, the year-end rally scenario will run into some real headwinds.\u201d\nIn a sign of the risk-off mood, investors are again piling in to gold and silver, which are considered safe havens amid uncertainty. The price of silver hit a record high on Monday as investors scooped up the metal, which can be considered a cheaper alternative to gold.Silver priceshave doubled this year, and have also been boosted by increased industrial demand.\nProponents of bitcoin say volatility is part of the journey. Meanwhile, critics say bitcoin is falling short of its proposed use as a store of value, given its susceptibility to intense fluctuations. Bitcoin is now down roughly 9% this year, while the S&P 500 is up roughly 16%, and gold is up almost 62%.\nAll things considered, the S&P 500 is less than 2% below a record high set in late October. December is a historically strong month for markets, and Wall Street is leaning in to bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month, which could boost stocks. However, more volatility could be in store as bitcoin languishes more than 30% below its record high and nerves linger about the yen carry trade.\n\u201cWith all of this in mind, we\u2019re still at a key juncture for the stock market,\u201d Maley said. \u201cThe developments out of Japan are creating some uncertainty about a year-end rally \u2026 so the \u2018all clear\u2019 flags are not flying high just yet.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/01\/economy\/us-stock-market-bitcoin-yen","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Why the crypto market is crashing","date":"2025-11-24","body":"Even bycrypto standards, it\u2019s been a rough few weeks.\nInvestors in digital assets are accustomed to extreme volatility, but a $1 trillion wipeout over the past six weeks has tested even crypto\u2019s diehard believers and alienated many of its newest converts.\nBitcoin, the industry bellwether, has fallen dramatically since early October, when it hit a record high of $126,000. The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency dipped below $81,000 on Friday before recovering slightly over the weekend. On Monday, as the broader stock market rallied, bitcoin topped $88,000, rising nearly 2% over a 24-hour period. (Crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.)\nIt is shaping up to be one of crypto\u2019s worst months on record, and it\u2019s not clear the market has bottomed out.\nWhy crypto briefly but dramatically crashed when Trump renewed his trade war\n\u201cWhether Bitcoin stabilizes after this correction remains uncertain,\u201d Deutsche Bank analysts wrote Monday. \u201cUnlike prior crashes, driven primarily by retail speculation, this year\u2019s downturn has occurred amid substantial institutional participation, policy developments, and global macro trends.\u201d\nWhile crypto\u2019s fate has broadly mirrored the stock market\u2019s in recent years, its current angst runs deeper. That\u2019s largely thanks to an influx of mainstream money that behaves very differently from the funds controlled by a typical crypto investor.\nBitcoin is in a bear market, having dropped 30% from its most recent high, while the S&P 500 is down just 3% from its most recent peak. It is on track for its worst month since the 2022 crypto \u201cwinter\u201d that culminated in the collapse ofSam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX.\nAnxiety is coursing through stocks and crypto for two key reasons: Investors are fretting overthe Federal Reserve\u2019s next rate cut, and they\u2019re worrying about whether AI is abubblethat\u2019ll blow up in their faces.\nAll of that weighs on crypto traders because digital assets, like tech stocks, are especially sensitive to changes in the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate, which affects the cost of borrowing money and can quickly sap investor appetite for risk.\nBut crypto investors have an additional hangover to deal with following anOctober 10 flash crash. When President Donald Trump reignited his trade war with China that day, it prompted a wave of panic-selling that triggered automatic liquidations across the highly leveraged crypto market. In a single day, the flash crashed wiped out $19 billion worth of crypto. For a lot of folks, the stomach-churning crash was all the motivation they needed to exit crypto completely, and that\u2019s left bitcoin and other tokens more susceptible to volatility.\nThe flash crash forced many investors sell their holdings to meet margin calls. That tends to have a snowball effect: The more bitcoin falls, the more calls investors face from their brokerages, the more they have to sell their bitcoin (and other holdings) to cover their positions.\nWhat makes this crypto crash different is the presence of billions of dollars that have entered the crypto market through spot bitcoin funds that US regulators approved last year.\nMainstream investors got into crypto to enjoy the ride up, but they don\u2019t have the same level of devotion to the ideology as early adopters who are bolstered by intense online communities encouraging one another to buy the dip and keep the faith.\n\u201cThe bottom line is, bitcoin is for normies now,\u201d Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told me. \u201cAs a result, the normies are going to view it as another speculative holding in their portfolio \u2026 it\u2019s going to be treated like a volatile mainstream investment.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/24\/business\/why-the-crypto-market-is-crashing","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"AI is about to face an enormous test. The market is already nervous","date":"2025-11-19","body":"Growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble have, in large part, caused the stock market\u2019srecent bout of volatility. So the AI industry will face an enormous test when Nvidia, the world\u2019s most valuable company and backbone of the AI boom, reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday.\nThe stock market rally \u2014\ufeffthat had been going practically nonstop since April until this month\u2019s blip \u2014 largely depends on Nvidia. The chipmaker, which is the gold standard for AI computing power, has propelled the market higher across the past three years.\nInvestors are now eager to know whether demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips \u2014 and its optimism about the future \u2014 are continuing to grow or if there are signs of AI fatigue.\nEarnings this month from tech company Palantir (PLTR), which uses AI for its government contracts, beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates. However, concerns about the stock\u2019s expensive valuation and nerves about a bubble gave investors pause \u2014 and fueled asell-off in AI stocksover the past several weeks. Nvidia\u2019s stock (NVDA) has fallen more than 8% this month, although it\u2019s still up 37% this year.\n\u201cThe market for the first time is questioning whether the hype will turn into reality,\u201d Bob Elliott, CIO at asset management firm Unlimited Funds, told CNN.\nNvidia\u2019s chips power part of practically every major AI venture, meaning investors will scrutinize its earnings as well as chief executive Jensen Huang\u2019s remarks.\n\u201cNvidia takes on even greater weight than normal,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t confirm high expectations built into the market, then watch out below.\u201d\nEvery investor should care about Nvidia\u2019s earnings this afternoon: Nvidia accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500, which is weighted by market value. That means investors \u2014 and those with 401(k)s \u2014 are increasingly exposed to the company\u2019s strong gains. Similarly, they are more exposed to a drop in Nvidia\u2019s stock price.\nAs of Tuesday, Nvidia shares\u2019 gains have accounted for 18% of the S&P 500\u2019s total return this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nSince Nvidia last reported earnings in August, concerns have been rising aboutcircular financing, with tech companies entwined in a massive web of extraordinarily lucrative deals.\nNow nerves are fraying about whether the money being poured into the AI boom will be justified. On top of that, tech stocks have become relatively expensive.\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s earnings on Wednesday are particularly important given the rising skepticism regarding the longevity of the AI cycle and current AI stock valuations,\u201d James Demmert,CIO at Main Street Research, said in an email. \u201cAnything less than a stellar report and outlook could make stock indexes vulnerable.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s bigger than just Wall Street. There are concerns that the AI boom \u2014 which has helped boost US economic growth this year \u2014 is now masking signs of weakness in the economy.\nAt its market value of $4.4 trillion, Nvidia is currently larger than every country\u2019s economy except the United States, China and Germany.\nNvidia\u2019s fate is interlinked with other big tech companies that depend on its products. A sign of a slowdown in demand could signal that the other tech companies are less confident about the AI buildout.\nSome Wall Street analysts are optimistic that Nvidia will continue to deliver impressive earnings. AI chatbots like ChatGPT \u2014 and the data centers powering AI \u2014 depend on the company\u2019s chips. It\u2019s the foundation of the current AI wave.\n\u201cThat is why everyone listens to every word that Jensen Huang has to say, because it\u2019s a good gauge of the health of the AI ecosystem,\u201d said Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research.\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/19\/markets\/nvidia-us-stock-market","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

And on Thursday, the September jobs report \u2014 long delayed because of the government shutdown \u2014 is set to be released.\nThese two events will provide more insight about the issues that are \u201ctop of mind\u201d for Wall Street, according to Jos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\nTech stocks havecome under pressurethis month as concerns linger about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 5.5% since hitting a record high in late October.\nInvestors are trying to discern whether the AI trade is on stable foundations, and whether the Federal Reserve will pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting in December.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin plunged on Monday to below $90,000 for the first time in seven mon\ufeffths, erasing its gains for this year. The cryptocurrency has tanked more than 28% in just six weeks after it hit a record high above $126,000 in early October.\nTech and crypto-related stocks led the S&P 500 lower on Monday. Coinbase (COIN), a crypto exchange, fell 7%.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Monday dipped below their 50-day moving averages, according to FactSet.

Tech stocks took a bruising last week before investors swooped in on Friday to buy the dip.\nInvestors this week are gearing up for a potential market-moving event with Nvidia\u2019s earnings. The chipmaker accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500\u2019s market value. Nvidia shares fell 1.83% on Monday, weighing on the broader market.\n\u201cThe monthly jobs report would normally dominate this week\u2019s economic calendar, but with the AI trade struggling the past couple of weeks, Nvidia\u2019s earnings are once again looking like a key piece of the market\u2019s momentum puzzle,\u201d Chris Larkin, managing director at Morgan Stanley\u2019s E-Trade, said in an email.\nThe recent stock market rally is also being tested as investors adjust to the prospect that the Fed might pause its interest rate-cutting cycle at its policy meeting next month. Traders are pricing in a 45% chance that the Fed cuts rates in December, according to CME FedWatch. That\u2019s down from a 94% chance one month ago.\nStocks have rallied on optimism about Fed rate cuts.

{"title":"Uncle Sam is outperforming the S&P 500","date":"2025-11-17","body":"The Trump administration is investing in publicly traded companies \u2014 and it\u2019s sending stocks soaring higher.\nUnder President Donald Trump, the US government has taken equity stakes in companies including Intel (INTC), MP Materials (MP), Lithium Americas (LAC) and Trilogy Metals (TMQ). Investing in public companies is an unusual move that has sparked debate on Wall Street and Capitol Hill about whether the government should be interfering in markets.\nProponents say the equity stakes are a strategic move to support companies in industries that are critical to national security, such as rare earths mining and the production of semiconductor chips. Critics, meanwhile, say it\u2019s a heavy-handed use of government influence that is un-American and exposes taxpayers to unnecessary risk.\nSo far, the government\u2019s portfolio is outperforming the S&P 500. Intel shares are up 77% this year. MP Materials shares have soared 276%. Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals shares are up 50% and 204%, respectively. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 14.5% this year.\n\u201cMarkets seem to be understanding these deals as the federal government signaling it will continue to support these companies,\u201d said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.\nMP Materials is a rare-earths mining company. The company on July 10 announced the Department of Defense (now the Department of War) would purchase $400 million of the company\u2019s stock, giving it a 15% equity stake and making it the company\u2019s largest shareholder.\nThis company is America\u2019s best chance to loosen China\u2019s grip on rare earths\nIntel, thebeleaguered chipmaker, announced on August 22 that the US government would invest $8.9 billion in the company, resulting in a 9.9% equity stake. On October 1, the Energy Department announced it would take a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas, a lithium production company.\nTrilogy Metals, a mining company that is developing anenormous mining project in Alaska, announced on October 6 that the US government would invest in the company. The Department of War took a10% equity stakein Trilogy Metals.\nThe Commerce Department announced on November 3 that it would take a $50 million stake in Vulcan Elements, a private rare earths start-up. The government also has a\u201cgolden share\u201din US Steel as part of a national security agreement with Nippon Steel, which acquired the company in June.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s actions are meant to address trade tensions with China, including bolstering supply chains of critical materials like chips and rare-earth minerals.\nRare earths in particular have become a sticking point in the US-China trade war. The minerals are used in everyday items like mobile phones as well as highly sensitive industries like defense, aerospace and the military.\nWhat are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump\u2019s trade deal with China?\nChina accounts for roughly 70% of global rare-earth elements mining output, 90% of rare earths refining output and over 90% of rare-earth magnet production, according to ING, a Dutch bank.\n\u2018Self-sufficiency, allied resilience and national industrial champions are no longer optional,\u201d James Litinsky, chief executive at MP Materials, said on the company\u2019s earnings call on November 6. \u201cThey are the front lines of security.\u201d\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that \u201cthe Trump administration is committed to using every tool at our disposal to safeguard America\u2019s national and economic security.\u201d\nThere is precedent for the government to take stakes in companies to bail them out during a crisis. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the government took stakes in companies including General Motors, Chrysler and AIG, then turned a small total profit when it exited those stakes by 2015.\nBut the government taking stock in companies outside of emergency situations is rare. Experts say it falls within a legal gray area.\n\u201cIt is a real break from past attitudes toward government ownership, particularly for Republicans,\u201d Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, said in an email.\nSkeptics say this kind of government intervention goes against free market values \u2014 and raises the risks of big losses for taxpayers. It\u2019s also uncertain that an equity stake can produce stronger supply chains.\nTrump is trying to break China\u2019s monopoly on rare earths, but can\u2019t cut deals fast enough to catch up\n\u201cThere is the risk of failure. Not all investments work out,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find people who are questioning, \u2018Why are we doing this? We don\u2019t need to risk our tax dollars.\u2019\u201d\nScott Ladner, CIO at Horizon Investments, said he was skeptical about the decision to take stakes in companies. The government historically has been poor at picking winners, he said, and it could divert money away from other, more compelling companies that are not in the government\u2019s purview.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like the precedent that it sets going forward,\u201d Ladner said. \u201cThese individual ones might end up working fine, but the precedent and the power that it gives to the government 10, 15, 20 years from now \u2014 I don\u2019t love that precedent.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/17\/investing\/equity-stakes-government-stock-market","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Say \u2018I do\u2019 to higher costs: How tariffs could impact wedding budgets","date":"2025-11-09","body":"Weddings can be expensive and stressful. But this year, prospective brides and grooms are dealing with an added layer, and it\u2019s not cake. It\u2019s tariffs.\nTwo million weddings take place in the United States every year, but they are very much an international affair. From the engagement ring to the cake, chairs, florals and the dress,all these items are touched by tariffs. Even those carefully crafted in the United States can contain multiple components from around the world.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade agenda isn\u2019t helping the average cost of a US wedding, which had already risen by 18% to $33,000 over the last five years, according to The Knot, a global wedding planning and vendor marketplace. With tariff rates as high as 50% for some countries, you can expect costs to rise.\nVendors are \u201cforced to make tough calls about whether to absorb increased costs or adjust their pricing, all while maintaining the level of service and quality their clients expect,\u201d said Raina Moskowitz, CEO of The Knot Worldwide.\nOne in five vendors have increased costs because of tariffs, according to the Knot, and 33% of engaged couples say they\u2019re worried about price increases.\nBeyond the bride, the dress is the star of the show.\nWedding dresses cost about $2,100, according to the Knot, which are often ordered and paid for more than a year in advance. That means that by the time the dress arrives (often shipped from overseas), tariff rates can change.\n\u201cThat dress that we agreed to a price with the shop on is all of a sudden costing us 30%, 40% more,\u201d said Justin Alexander, president of the 79-year-old brand Justin Alexander Wedding Dresses.\nThe family-owned dressmaker sells 70,000 dresses each year, with 40,000 sold to US brides. The company manufactures in Myanmar (40% tariff), China (20%), Vietnam (20%), and Portugal (10%).\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been diversifying our production out of China, but recent developments with higher tariffs in countries like Myanmar have been confusing and challenging,\u201d said Alexander.\nBut the added cost doesn\u2019t just depend on where the dress is manufactured. Many of the materials in a single garment, like the lace, lining and tulle, could be sourced from multiple other countries, all with their own tariff rates.\nAlexander said it would difficult to shift dress and material production back to the United States because of higher labor costs and the lack of manufacturing at scale. It would also end up raising costs for brides by eleven to fifteen times in terms of price.\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t have the possibility to reshore the 70,000 dresses that we produce annually because the labor just doesn\u2019t exist. And if it did, the cost to produce our wedding dresses would make it unaffordable for our customers.\u201d\nJustin Alexander, President of Justin Alexander Wedding Dresses\nBrides in the market for a Justin Alexander gown can already expect to pay 10% more.\n\u201cThe price has been increased because we have a tariff surcharge to account for the increase in tariffs varying from 20% to 40%,\u201d said Alexander, who said the company absorbs the rest.\nWedding cake orders are often placed later in the wedding planning process, sometimes just three weeks before the event, and can cost $540 on average, according to the Knot.\nArmana Christianson is the owner and cake artist at A. Cakes Bakery in Phoenix, Arizona. She bakes 100 high-end cakes each year that can cost anywhere from $800 to $1000. Christianson said one cake can have up to a dozen ingredients \u2013 all sourced from different countries with varying tariff rates.\nSo she\u2019s introduced a new contract to make sure she\u2019s protected from fluctuating prices.\n\u201cIf my pricing raises more than 5%\u2026 then I\u2019m able to tell my clients and potentially charge them for that increase if it\u2019s something just exorbitant,\u201d said Christianson.\n\u201cI\u2019m a hundred percent risking that I could be losing clients because I have to raise my prices.\u201d\nArmana Christianson, cake artist at A. Cakes Bakery\nShe said it\u2019s dizzying to keep track of all the tariff rates, which for her ingredients can range up to 20%.\n\u201cI\u2019m raising and readjusting (my prices) every six months,\u201d said Christianson. \u201cMy percentage booked from inquiries just goes down a little bit more each time, which is why I would prefer to not have to change my pricing. So often it is scary as a small business owner, this is my living.\u201d\nBefore \u2018I do,\u2019 comes \u2018yes!\u2019 The engagement ring signals the official start of wedding planning.\nEngagement rings currently cost about $5,200 on average, according to the Knot. Jewelers said couples are getting increasingly creative with their rings, opting for precious gemstones and lab-grown diamonds, but many still look for traditional diamonds.\nMany of the stones and rings that couples see in stores have likely been in the United States for at least six months. That means the current stock is mostly tariff-free, but that inventory is running thin.\n\u201cEverything new coming in is going to incur (a) tariff. Consumers that are buying in January of 2026 are going to see a lot higher prices than people that are buying today,\u201d said Ankur Daga, co-founder of Angara Jewelry, a Los Angeles-based company.\nA solitaire diamond ring at Angara, for example, is sourced from Botswana and carries a 15% tariff. The gold could be from Indonesia or Chile, which carries tariffs of 19% and 10%, respectively, or the US or Canada, which may not carry any duties at all.\nAngara sources its sapphires from Sri Lanka (20% tariff), rubies from Mozambique (15% tariff), emeralds from Zambia (15%) and Colombia (10%), and opals from Australia (10%).\n\u201cThe whole business model is fundamentally changing; you\u2019re taking on a lot more risk.\u201d\nAnkur Daga, co-founder of Angara Jewelry\nBut the majority of all diamonds \u2013 90% \u2013 are cut and polished in India, which holds a towering tariff rate of 50%. That\u2019s why Angara now does all final manufacturing for its US market out of Thailand, not India, so stones coming to the United States carry a lower 19% tariff rate.\nYet Daga believes there is still a market for affordability.\n\u201cWhat tariffs will do is drive the adoption of lab-grown (diamonds) far faster. It\u2019s already at 57%, for engagement rings. We think within five years, this will be 80%,\u201d he said.\nFloral prices can be one of the most volatile in any wedding. Eighty percent of all cut flowers are imported to the US, and a flower market may sell roses at different prices from each day to the next. Add in changing tariff rates, and it gets complicated for vendors.\n\u201cThat\u2019s been kind of the worst part, just nailing down the consistency of it and nailing down what to expect and how to protect myself and my business,\u201d said Marie Lewis, the owner of Nocturne in Bloom, a floral design studio in Los Angeles. Couples spend $2,700 on average for florals, according to the Knot.\n\u201cThe less exact and the less specific you can be with the stems and the flowers that you are expecting, the easier it is for us as businesspeople and creative people to come up with an alternative.\u201d\nMarie Lewis, owner of Nocturne and Bloom\nOne bouquet or arrangement likely has several types of flowers, each sourced from different countries.\nEven the vases and candle holders have gone up in price. Lewis buys hers from China.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve been doing is just trying to pad the pricing a little bit more within each floralarrangement,\u201d she said. \u201cThat makes sure that I\u2019m charging for my services and materials appropriately so that I\u2019m not left in the hole, but also making sure that I am being appropriate with my clients.\u201d\nAfter all the planning and anticipation, the big day is here.The venue which hosts the event can cost couples an average of $12,000, according to the Knot. Rentals cost an additional $2,000.\nIt\u2019s currently the busy season for the Treasury Venue Collection in St. Augustine, Florida, which runs from October through May. The company hosts up to 300 weddings a year at its two locations.\nThe Treasury Venue Collection hasn\u2019t had to raise prices this year, partly because it identified where the tariffs would impact costs most.\nThis summer, the venue stockpiled popular imported liquor, wine and champagne.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t produce tequila outside of Mexico. It\u2019s like champagne. champagne is only made in Champagne France.\u201d\nBrandy Boulette, general manager at The Treasury Venue Collection\n\u201cAlcohol, that is our vulnerable item,\u201d said Brandy Boulette, the general manager at the Treasury Venue Collection. \u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily have to worry about our venue cost changing, because it\u2019s kind of a fixed thing, but our bar service was going to be something that was definitely impacted.\u201d\nA venue typically provides linens, chairs, glassware, and cutlery, which are purchased in bulk and reused wedding-to-wedding. But those items often have to be replaced because of wear and tear.\n\u201cWe\u2019re telling people right now with anything they might have been budgeting for \u2013 put a buffer in there,\u201d said Boulette.\nSome venues are just a raw space, and it\u2019s up to the couple to bring everything else in. They often rely on event design companies like Paisley & Jade in Richmond, Virginia, that specialize in luxury rentals and custom designs, to help.\n\u201cEven building a simple shelf for a back bar really involves all of these bits and pieces from all over,\u201d said Morgan Montgomery, co-owner of Paisley & Jade.\nA custom venue design may have pendant lights and chairs from China, or a custom cake table of materials from New Zealand, Malaysia, and Canada.  And special-order items that aren\u2019t already in inventory come at a premium.\n\u201cI won\u2019t guarantee a price. I can give you a ballpark, but I will not lock it in because my business cannot be on the hook for telling you that I can get you this sofa for $1,200 a piece, only to find out that the tariffs jumped by the time I placed the order,\u201d said Montgomery.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/09\/business\/wedding-industry-budgets-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Why markets are suddenly on edge","date":"2025-11-14","body":"For months, it felt like nothing could knock stocks off their steady ascent \u2014 but November has been a rough month on Wall Street.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down almost 3.5% this month and on track for its first losing month since March. The Nasdaq has shed roughly $1.74 trillion in market value in two weeks as investors have dumped tech stocks.\nStocks opened sharply lower Friday before bouncing off their lows as investors bought the dip. The major indexes wavered into the closing bell. The Nasdaq turned positive and closed higher by 0.13% after briefly falling almost 1.9%. The S&P 500 fluctuated and closed lower by 0.05%. The Dow fell 310 points, or 0.65%.\n\u201cStocks were set for another horrific session at the open following yesterday\u2019s debacle but investors saw the sharp dip as an opportunity to accumulate shares,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 is still down 1.55% this month while the Dow is down 0.87%. The S&P 500 has shed more than $1.3 trillion in market value in just over two weeks as it has retreated from a record high set in late October.\nAfter months of gains, investors have outsized expectations, making them easer to disappoint. Tech stocks have becomerelatively pricey.\nAnd after the government shutdown halted official data releases for weeks, investors are unsure what the new figures,as government releases resume,will show about the state of the world\u2019s biggest economy. That, in turn, is stoking uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates in December, and adding to the Wall Street jitters.\nThe government is back open. Here\u2019s what that means for economic data\n\u201cWhen the government was shut down, we could believe whatever we wanted to believe,\u201d Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN\u2019s Matt Egan. \u201cNow we need to be data dependent, and that may not be as much fun.\u201d\nEnthusiasm about artificial intelligence carried the market to new record highs this year. But now some investors are hitting pause, taking profits and reassessing whether those stocks will continue to produce superior returns.\n\u201cWith lofty valuations in AI-related stocks, it\u2019s understandable that investors are on edge about anything that might go wrong,\u201d Yardeni wrote in a Thursday note.\nBitcoin, which can serve as a gauge of how risk-on investors are feeling, slid 4% on Friday and hovered around $94,500. The cryptocurrency has tumbled 25% since it hit a record high in early October.\nWall Street and the Fed are awaiting a deluge of economic data that was delayed due to the shutdown.\nThat is contributing to mounting nerves about the Fed\u2019s next move. Traders on Friday were pricing a 46% chance the central bank will cut rates in December, down from a 96% chance one month ago.\nAt the last policy meeting, in October, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cast some doubt on whether the Fed would cut rates again this year. Fed officials \u2014 including Boston Fed President Susan Collins, who is a voter on policy moves this year \u2014 delivered remarks this week that have shown hesitancy to continue cutting rates.\nWhile Evercore ISI analysts in a note said they still see an interest rate cut next month, they think it\u2019s \u201cvery hard to call\u201d because of a combination of factors, including \u201cdata blindness.\u201d\nThe central bank\u2019s rate cuts in September and October boosted stocks, and a pause on rate cuts could pose troubles for stocks that have rallied on expectations for lower borrowing costs \u2014 in particular, the AI and tech stocks that have propelled the market higher.\n\u201cExtreme fear\u201d was the sentiment driving markets on Friday, according toCNN\u2019s Fear and Greed index.\nBut some investors say a pullback in stocks can also be healthy.\nThe Nasdaq gained every month from April through the end of October. Now, the market is resetting as investors reassess the outlook.\n\u201cThis (pullback) is somewhat overdue, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the start of acorrection,\u201d Yardeni said.\nThere is also increasing skepticism about whether Big Tech companies can make enough money to justify the enormous spending taking place on AI deals now.\n\u201cThe technology sector has faced selling pressure in recent weeks amid concerns over rising debt issuance and a surge in capital expenditures\u201d like new data centers, Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist, told CNN\u2019s Matt Egan in an email. \u201cInvestors are questioning whether these investments will translate into future profitability.\u201d\nOracle shares (ORCL) surged 36% in one day on September 10 after the company announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Shares in Oracle have tumbled since then, erasing those gains.\n\u201cCompanies announcing large supply deals with OpenAI have similarly been met with skepticism around OpenAI\u2019s ability to deliver on its financial objectives,\u201d John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in an email.\nIt\u2019s not just Oracle facing pressure. Meta shares (META) are down 23% since hitting a record high in mid-August. Nvidia shares (NVDA) are down 10% since hitting a record high in late October. Palantir shares (PLTR) are down 16% since hitting a record high on November 3.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened recently in the market isn\u2019t even close to a tech wreck, but it may be a bit of a tech reckoning,\u201d said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team.\nTo Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, this month has been defined by investors rotating out of tech stocks and into other sectors.\nThe recent pullback, he said, feels like \u201cinvestors trying to protect profits after a really healthy run off the lows in April.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/14\/investing\/us-stock-market","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Why it\u2019s so hard to figure out the economy right now","date":"2025-11-23","body":"A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nThe stock market keeps breaking records, but angst about the economy keeps befuddling politicians.\nThe wealthy are getting wealthier, but everyone else feels somewhat left behind. The executive editor of CNN Business, David Goldman, published an interesting video in which he compared the difficulty of selling $12 burritos with the fact that $230 iPhone socks \u2014 yes, they\u2019re a thing \u2014 are a hot item.\nI talked to Goldman by email about the concept behind this conundrum, that the US economy is shaped like a K. Our conversation is below, along with his video.\nWOLF: I was struck by your video about the K-shaped economy. First, can you just explain what that is?\nGOLDMAN:You can think of America\u2019s economy as basically split in two. If you make a lot of money, you probably are wondering what all the fuss is about: Your 401(k) is doing great this year, you have a paycheck that may be outpacing inflation, and you can afford to spend on stuff you don\u2019t necessarily need.\nIf you\u2019re not in that category \u2014 and a growing number of Americans aren\u2019t \u2014 you hate this economy. You never adjusted to the price shock of 2022, and inflation has stubbornly raised prices since then (even if they\u2019re more under control than they were under Biden). You\u2019re probably borrowing money to pay for necessities, and you may be increasingly late on your debt payments.\nSo if you\u2019re at the top of the K, you\u2019re the reason why all the economic data still looks good, overall. If you\u2019re at the bottom of the K, you\u2019re the reason why all the polling data suggests President Donald Trump\u2019s support on the economyhas effectively vanished.\nWOLF:I think you could apply that same K shape to the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d the signature law, so far, of Trump 2.0. Among many other things, it tries to pay for tax cuts that predominantly benefit higher-income Americans with controls on Medicaid and SNAP benefits that affect the lowest-income Americans. Point being: Has the US always had a K-shaped economy?\nGOLDMAN: Yes, but it\u2019s getting worse.\nThe K-shaped economy has been a growing problem for decades, made worse by the loss of guaranteed worker pensions, the rise of the gig economy, increasinghealth-care inflation, the high cost of college, the lack of affordable housing\u2026 We\u2019ve all heard the story, and we know it because we\u2019re living it.\nActually, the one exception \u2014 when lower-income workers gained ground against high-income workers \u2014 was during the few years that followed the pandemic. Government support gave working-class folks a leg up, and, for the first time in a generation, the wealth gap narrowed. Oh, and mortgage rates were dirt cheap, which let homeowners refinance like crazy to make their mortgage payments as low as possible.\nBut it didn\u2019t last. The stimulus-check sugar rush wore off, and the economy kind of resumed its previous trajectory.\nNow the gap in the K is accelerating: Mortgage rates are near multi-decade highs, Trump iscutting safety-net programsand increasing hurdles toaccess support.\nOn Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that inflation-adjusted hourly pay fell 0.1% between August and September for people who aren\u2019t in managerial roles (i.e., low-income folks). That means that their real pay got a little smaller in the summer, because higher prices ate into their earnings. Meanwhile, real earnings for higher-paid positions gained, even when accounting for inflation. So the wealth gap is widening.\nYou can see that inWalmart\u2019s earnings this past week: The fastest-growing customer segment for Walmart is middle-income folks who make more than $100,000. So the middle-class is starting to penny-pinch, too.\nWOLF: The K-shaped economy concept fits with another term that is currently dominant in the political conversation: affordability. In hindsight, affordability may have sunk Democrats in 2024. It\u2019s the issue that, at the moment, is doing real damage to Trump. What distinguishes the affordability issue today from the inequality issue that was very much in the news a few years ago?\nGOLDMAN: I think they\u2019re two sides of the same coin. If the economy is working for you, you\u2019re not super concerned about affordability. You might grimace when you pay $5 for something that cost $3 a couple years ago, but $2 isn\u2019t breaking the bank. If the economy is leaving you behind, you may stop buying that thing altogether \u2014 or go into debt to pay for it.\nIf you watched my K-shaped economy video, there\u2019s a reason I used the $230 iPhone \u201csock\u201d and the $12 Chipotle burrito as examples. The iPhone sock has been ridiculed because of the price \u2014 but it\u2019s completely sold out. For people who can afford it, they perceived value in a trendy designer item. But Chipotle\u2019s CEO last month said the company is really struggling with customers who make $100,000 a year or less, because they don\u2019t think a $12 burrito bowl is better value than buying food at the grocery store.\nWOLF: Polling suggests Americans don\u2019t think President Trump has done enough on affordability. What do the numbers say? Is there any proof yet that his tariffs are driving up costs?\nGOLDMAN:There\u2019s not a ton of evidence yet that Trump\u2019s tariffs are raising prices broadly. Inflation is at 3% annually \u2014 the same as when Trump took office (although it fell close to 2% in the first few months after he took office and then started rising again).\nThere hasn\u2019t been a CPI inflation report since the shutdown started, so the data\u2019s a little stale \u2026 and Trump didn\u2019t really put his tariffs in place widely until August. But you see prices rising in certain items like furniture (up 6% over the past 12 months through September) and Swiss watches (up 6.6%) that we just don\u2019t make here. You see it in tropical fruits like bananas (up 7%) and coffee (up 19%), which is why the administration reversed course and cut tariffs on produce we don\u2019t grow here.\nThe right-leaning Tax Foundation estimates that the average American household will pay $1,200 more this year than last year because of Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 so, like $100 a month. But Trump also cut taxes, so for some folks in higher income brackets, that\u2019ll even out some.\nStill, JPMorgan had an interesting report last month that suggested businesses are eating about 80% of the tariff costs right now \u2014 but there\u2019s evidence that they can\u2019t keep taking that on, as profit margins get thinner \u2026 so they\u2019re about to start passing that onto consumers.\nBy this time next year, JPMorgan economists said they wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that was flipped \u2014 so you\u2019ll be paying 80% and businesses will be shouldering just 20%. Ouch. The Tax Foundation agrees and said next year your tariff costs on average will be $1,600 per household.\nWOLF: Is there anything more that Trump could be doing on housing?\nGOLDMAN:Housing is such a tricky one. \u2026 Trump\u2019s housing ideas are pretty wacky, especially the50-year mortgagethat basically everyone across the political spectrum hated. The portable mortgages (where you take your mortgage with you when you buy a new house) or assumable mortgages (where you take on the seller\u2019s mortgage) are interesting ideas but super complex, and experts told us that it could break the underlying market that effectively makes the entire mortgage system work in the first place. Not fun.\nThe real problem is that we stopped building homes in this country during the financial crisis, which was exacerbated by a housing crash. Supply hasn\u2019t kept up with demand, and if you took Econ 101, you know that means prices rise. And there\u2019s just not much that Trump or anyone in the federal government can do about that. He\u2019s talked about opening up federal lands, but \u2026 those aren\u2019t places people want to live.\nState and local governments are increasingly serious about taking on this issue. You had thataffordable housing interview about New York Citya couple weeks ago, so you know each location\u2019s housing issues are unique. The advocate you interviewed said New York is focused on cutting red tape, but I\u2019m skeptical of his argument that New York has plenty of room to build. It\u2019s true that there are low-density areas of the city, but they tend to be far from accessible public transportation. I hope he\u2019s right \u2014 it\u2019s insanely expensive to live here!\nCalifornia is doing some really interesting \u2014 if controversial \u2014 experimentation with zoning laws that could help ease the housing affordability crisis. But NIMBYism is real, and there\u2019s no quick or easy fix.\nWOLF:One story that has not gotten enough attention during Trump 2.0 is the stakes the US government is taking in private companies like Intel and others. What\u2019s your take on it? Necessary to maintain US dominance or a nationalist hazard to capitalism?\nGOLDMAN:I mean,we just did a storyon how those stocks that Trump invested taxpayers\u2019 money in are outperforming the S&P 500 by a pretty wide margin. So \u2026 I guess I\u2019m pro? For now at least? Haha.\nThe risk is, of course, that this all comes crashing down in some kind of AI bubble burst that could make put those investments under water. There\u2019s no sense that we\u2019re in danger of that happening imminently, but certainly the market is growing concerned that AI may be overvalued.\nIt\u2019s pretty extraordinary for the government to become an investor in companies of this magnitude. I mean, webailed out Chrysler and GM 16 years ago, but that was an emergency event during the biggest recession since the Great Depression, so that\u2019s very different from the situation we\u2019re in right now. Nvidia is a $5 trillion company, America is clearly leading the way. \u2026 I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a real argument that this kind of investment is necessary to maintain America\u2019s dominance.\nWith that said, for projects of massive scale, like NASA, public-private partnerships work extremely well. AI may eventually be on that kind of scale, and it really is a national security concern to the United States if China takes the lead on this potentially earth-shattering technology.\nI don\u2019t know about the nationalist hazard to capitalism. \u2026 I\u2019ve heard the argument, but \u201cpicking winners and losers\u201d sounds like more of a talking point than a real concern. Intel was a deeply troubled company before America took an investment in it, and I\u2019m not sure $10 billion is going to return it to dominance. I think Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom are right to be annoyed but they\u2019re going to be just fine.\nWOLF: There have been a lot of stories recently about an AI bubble that\u2019s keeping the stock market in record territory. What does that mean for Americans who are the market (and by that I mean pretty much everyone with a 401k)?\nGOLDMAN:Yeah, remember the dot-com bust that led to a mini-recession in the early 2000s? That\u2019s what could happen if this thing goes south. The eight most valuable companies on the market are all worth north of $1 trillion and they\u2019re all AI companies. Nvidia, the granddaddy of all AI companies, makes up 8% of the S&P 500. So you have a lot riding on AI, even if you\u2019re a buy-and-hold index fund kind of investor.\nBut I don\u2019t buy that we\u2019re in for a crash any time soon. There is a stupid amount of money floating around, but it\u2019s not phony baloney money \u2014 it\u2019s backed up by legit banks and not smoke and mirrors like during the dot-com bust. There are no Pets.coms out there that I can see \u2014 and a lot of potential Amazons.\nWith that said, are we in an AI bubble? Almost certainly. Is it about to pop? I have no idea. This still could be early days. It\u2019s notoriously difficult to know what stage of a bubble we\u2019re in until it bursts.\nWOLF:\ufeffOurrecent story about Nvidia, the $5 trillion company, included the term \u201ccircular funding deals.\u201d Is that a new thing in the AI era? Is it something that is concerning to people who pay a lot of attention to the economy as a whole?\nGOLDMAN:Basically, everyone is in bed with one another. Can I say that on this podcast? This is a podcast, right?\nYeah, this is the craziest part of all this. There are chipmakers, database companies, server farms, cloud providers and application builders, and it seems like all of them are invested in one another. It\u2019s smart, I suppose, to spread the risk. But it also means everyone is basically exposed to the same potential fallout if one of these companies goes down.\nThe reason they\u2019re doing it is because there is so much demand for AI chips, so much demand for server capacity, so much demand for power. \u2026 It\u2019s just not possible to say \u201cwe choose you, exclusively\u201d and remain competitive.\nWOLF: We\u2019re behind on economic data because of the shutdown. What are the most important year-end reports and indicators you\u2019ll be looking at for the strength of the economy this year?\nGOLDMAN:Jobs and inflation are the big ones for me. We got some mixed news in the September jobs report \u2014 the unemployment rate rose higher than expected, but so did the number of jobs created. We have no idea what\u2019s going on with prices. We\u2019ll find out soon.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/23\/politics\/economy-tariffs-prices-ai-stock-market-analysis","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

People in households that bring in less than $100,000 a year drive about 40% of Chipotle\u2019s sales.\nAnother problem: 25- to 34-year-olds, who make up 25% of Chipotle\u2019s sales, \u201cpulled back meaningfully.\u201d\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a component of a more discerning consumer, and I think most of it \u2013 the majority of it \u2013 is this massive pullback,\u201d Boatwright said. \u201cThat household under $100,000 a year is pulling back.\u201d\nAt the same time, some consumers are spending like they\u2019re from a completely different universe.\nCrocs CEO Andrew Rees noted that bifurcation on a call with analysts Thursday: \u201cThere is a portion of our North American consumers that are highly affluent. They\u2019re buying Crocs, they\u2019re buying other high-end brands and they are in great financial shape,\u201d Rees said. \u201cBut there is a large portion of consumers who are nervous, they are in less-good financial shape and are being super cautious about their spending and certainly spending closer to need.\u201d\nOr take Coke (to wash down your burrito). Coca-Cola\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun on a call last week with analysts said Coke\u2019s earnings were boosted by strong demand for the company\u2019s premium brands: Topo Chico, Smartwater and Fairlife.\nBut Braun highlighted a successful two-pronged corporate strategy, noting the tough environment for lower-income consumers hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 despite the growth in its high-end brands. That\u2019s why Coke is also cutting sizes (and prices) on the lower end to drive sales \u2013 to \u201creally tackle not only affordability but premiumization as well,\u201d Braun said.\n\u201cWhen we look from a consumer point of view, we continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,\u201d Braun said. \u201cThe pressure on middle- and low-end income consumers is still there.\u201d\nEconomists call that phenomenon a \u201cK-shaped\u201d economy: Wealthier people are spending like nothing\u2019s wrong. Lower-income people are making significant changes to preserve their finances.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powelladdressed that conceptWednesday in a media briefing.\n\u201cOn the K-shaped economy \u2026 if you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big public consumer-facing companies, many, many of them are saying there is a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,\u201d Powell said. \u201cBut at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not all anecdotal: Last month, Moody\u2019s Analytics reported that the country\u2019s top earnersare accounting for a growing share of overall spending.\nWhat\u2019s causing that divide?\nWealthier Americans are generally invested in the surging stock market, which has gained 17% this year. They have more job security than lower-income workers. And they own homes, whichkeep appreciatingin the tight-supply market.\nBy contrast, less-affluent Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and their wages aren\u2019t keeping up with inflation. If they lose their jobs, the cruddy labor market is preventing them from finding a new one \u2013 the number of Americans on unemployment insurance for multiple weeks recently surged to afour-year high. And rents, until recently, had jumped as demand for rentals explodes \u2013 because so few homes have been on the market.\nA K-shaped economy can be difficult to repair. America\u2019s economy has been increasingly bifurcated for quite some time \u2013 with the exception of a few years following the pandemic.\nDuring those post-pandemic years, government support for workers gave lower-income Americans a leg up. For the first time in a generation, the wealth gap narrowed.Wages outpaced inflation, especially for lower-income workers. Interest rates were low, and homeowners refinanced like crazy to lock in historically low mortgage costs.\nBut it was short-lived. The sugar rush of government stimulus checks wore off, and the economy resumed its previous trajectory. Mortgage rates rose to multi-decade highs. And, concerning for people who are getting left behind, the US government began pushing safety-net programs in the opposite direction, reducing benefits and increasing hurdles to access support.\nThose actions could widen that \u201cK\u201d in the future. Wider than you have to open your mouth to eat a Chipotle burrito.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/31\/business\/k-shaped-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s undeniable stock market victory that no one saw coming","date":"2025-11-04","body":"One year after President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection, the US stock market continues to notchrecord highs.\nThe S&P 500 has gained 19.6% over the past 12 months, boosted by strong corporate earnings and investors\u2019 enthusiasm about artificial intelligence. Stocks have been remarkably adaptable, defying concerns about a resurgence in global trade tensions and bouts of intense volatility.\nTo Trump, the market\u2019s gains are a vindication of his policies. The president on October 28 touted stocks\u2019 record highs during a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n\u201cTheir stock market today and our stock market today hit an all-time high,\u201d Trumpsaid. \u201cThat means we\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\nBut some analysts say the stock market\u2019s gains have a more prosaic reason: Corporate earnings continue to impress Wall Street, and investors are betting big on AI.\n\u201cWhat happens in Washington matters, but it\u2019s not the only thing that matters,\u201d said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist. \u201cDespite all the shifting narratives, the key theme for this year is the dominance of tech and AI and the continued resilience of corporate America.\u201d\nThe stock market\u2019s resilience has been surprising, said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management, considering Trump\u2019s \u201cpretty aggressive changes and approaches\u201d to US trade policy and the Federal Reserve, which he has pressured to lower interest rates.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s introduced a lot of uncertainty into markets over the last year,\u201d Ellerbroek said. \u201cThe market hates uncertainty.\u201d\nInvestors have turned their attention to the AI trade and tried to look past concerns about tariffs, he said.\n\u201cThis AI investment cycle is humongous and unprecedented and overwhelming any and all of those things,\u201d Ellerbroek said.\nThe S&P 500, which is weighted by market value, has become increasingly concentrated in big tech companies. Nvidia (NVDA), which just hit$5 trillionin market value, now accounts for 8% of the S&P 500\u2019s market value.\nAn equal-weighted version of the S&P 500, which gives all the companies in the index an equal part, is up just 6% over the past 12 months, compared to the benchmark index\u2019s 19.6% gain.\nThe S&P 500 fell as much as 19% in April as Trump rolled out hisplan for tariffs. But as markets tumbled, the Trump administration walked back its most severe proposals.\nSince then, the S&P 500 has coasted higher. The index is up six months in a row.\n\u201cStocks may be higher in part because the administration\u2019s final tariff actions were ultimately less severe than initially feared,\u201d said Mark Malek, CIO at brokerage firm Siebert Financial. \u201cWere it not for the tariff-driven swoon earlier this year, markets would likely be even higher today.\u201d\nFrom Trump\u2019s election through the end of October, the S&P 500\u2019s rise was the eighth best for a president\u2019s first year since the end of World War II, according to CFRA Research data. The S&P 500 climbed roughly 38% during the same period during President Joe Biden\u2019s term, marking the best performance on record.\nMeanwhile, the US stock market\u2019s gains this year pale in comparison to global markets. In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi index has soared 66% across the past 12 months. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index has gained 28%. Benchmark stock indexes in Poland and Greece have gained roughly 52% and 60%, respectively.\nThe US stock market\u2019s rollercoaster ride since Trump took office\nWhile stocks are near record highs, the Treasury market has also advanced. Despite concerns about US deficits, Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d and attacks on the Fed\u2019s independence, investors have still flocked to US government bonds.\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield, which influences a host of interest rates across the economy, has declined from 4.4% in November 2024 to 4.1% this month.\nWall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, has signaled relative calm in markets for the majority of the past six months. An index tracking volatility in the bond market is hovering near its lowest level this year.\n\u201cWe want the most America-first policies that are possible, without incurring market wrath,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Financial Times in October.\n\u201cWhat gets the people in trouble is they come in, they have these ideas, but they don\u2019t respect the market,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to respect the market.\u201d\nWhen Trump was reelected,investors cheeredthe potential for deregulation and tax cuts, while the Fed had recently cut interest rates, providing a boost for stocks.\nRoss Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, said he has not been surprised by the stock market\u2019s ascent.\n\u201cThe administration has largely delivered on a lot of those things that investors were so bullish about,\u201d Mayfield said.\n\u201cUltimately you zoom back and you say, \u2018All right, it\u2019s an AI bull market,\u2019\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cThe administration took the baton from the last administration only two years into a bull market, still with a lot of leg room left and companies growing their earnings.\u201d\nOpenAI wants to build the next era of the web, and it\u2019s shelling out billions to do it\nMayfield said he expects the rally to continue, but he is also cautious about a potential pullback, given just how far things have run.\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect a smooth ride,\u201d he said. \u201cI would expect a correction at some point in the next 12 months \u2014 10% to 15% maybe.\u201d\nA growing chorus of Wall Street CEOs concurs: David Solomon, chief executive at Goldman Sachs, said he thinks there will be a 10% to 20% drawdown in stocks sometime in the next one to two years.\n\u201cThings run and they pull back so people can reassess,\u201d Solomon said during a panel at the Global Financial Leaders\u2019 Investment Summit in Hong Kong.\nWhile the S&P 500 continues to hit record highs, the index is being carried by big tech and AI. It leaves everyday investors and 401(k)s increasingly exposed to enormous gains, but vulnerable to a downturn.\nTo Lerner at Truist, the bull market deserves the benefit of the doubt.\n\u201cThe North Star of this bull market is corporate profits,\u201d Lerner said.\nBut with stocks trading at historically expensive levels, there are risks abound.\n\u201cWhen you haven\u2019t had a pullback since April, I think you\u2019re just more susceptible to negative surprises, whatever those may be,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cYou might be somewhat less able to absorb them.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/04\/markets\/us-stock-market","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

The Dow fell 499 points, or 1.07%. The S&P 500 fell 0.83%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.21%.\nThe S&P 500 closed lower for the fourth day in a row, marking its longest daily losing streak since August.\nJust six weeks after notching a record high above $126,000, bitcoin has plummeted more than 26%. The cryptocurrency on Tuesday afternoon traded just below $93,000, erasing all of its gains for this year.\nBitcoin late Monday haddipped below $90,000for the first time in seven months before paring some losses early Tuesday.\nInvestors in recent weeks have increasingly shunned risky assets like AI stocks and crypto. Not helping: uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. The risk-off attitude is weighing on bitcoin, a highly speculative and volatile investment.\nIn Wall Street terms, bitcoin is in a bear market \u2014 when a price falls more than 20% from a recent peak. Bitcoin has shed more than $600 billion in market value during its tumble, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s pullback is part of a broader shift in risk sentiment,\u201d said Haider Rafique, global managing partner at OKX, a crypto exchange.\nAfter a strong six-month rally in stocks, nerves are mounting about expensive valuations and enormous spending plans by big tech companies. A wide range of tech and AI stocks were lower on Tuesday: Nvidia shares (NVDA) fell 2.81%. Amazon shares (AMZN) fell 4.43% and Microsoft shares (MSFT) fell 2.7%.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 6.6% since hitting a record high late October and has shed roughly $2.6 trillion in market value during its slide.\nWall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the VIX, jumped 10% on Tuesday.CNN\u2019s Fear and Greed indexhovered in \u201cextreme fear\u201d and slid to its lowest level since early April.\nAdding to the pressure on bitcoin: Long-term investors may be closing their positions to lock in profits after meteoric gains in recent years.\n\u201cBitcoin has struggled as a result of selling pressure from long-term holders taking profits but also uncertainty around Fed policy, the liquidity environment and other macro conditions,\u201d said Gerry O\u2019Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management.\nBitcoin has struggled to meaningfully recover since aflash crashon October 10 when President Donald Trump reignited his trade war with China. Some buyers and sellers have left the market since then, so there are fewer orders for bitcoin, leaving the price more susceptible to volatility, according to Peter Chung, head of Presto Research.\n\u201cBitcoin is under pressure in line with other risk assets (see the price actions of the AI stocks), but its downside is amplified due to a crypto-specific factor \u2014 namely, the orderbooks have gotten thinner in the aftermath of the (October 10) liquidations, which hurt many market makers in the space,\u201d Chung said in an email.\nWhy crypto briefly but dramatically crashed when Trump renewed his trade war\nUp until recent weeks, it had been a relatively strong year for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $69,000 ahead of Trump\u2019s reelection in November before surging about 83% \u2014 amid bouts of volatility \u2014 to its record high above $126,000 in early October.\nBitcoinsurpassed $100,000for the first time in early December 2024 as investors leaned in to optimism about the Trump administration ushering in crypto-friendly regulations.\nTrump has embraced the cryptocurrency industry and his administration has loosened oversight and advocated for pro-crypto legislation. TheGENIUS Actwas passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump in July, ushering in a new era of regulation forstablecoins, another kind of crypto.\nTrump tapped Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto regulator, to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, and cryptocurrencies continue to enter the mainstream, with new exchange-traded products giving investors easier access to buying and selling crypto.\nBitcoin traded around $94,000 entering the year. It has now wiped out its gains over the past 11 months. By comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 is up 12.5% this year. Gold prices are up 54%.\nWhy some elite investors are turning on the darling of the AI rally\nWhile tech stocks have also come under pressure, investors have been swooping in to the buy the dip. Nvidia (NVDA) on Friday tumbled as much as 3.36% before finishing the day higher by 1.77%. Nvidia on Monday fell as much as 3.08% before finishing the day lower by just 1.88%.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin is still languishing around $93,000 and has yet to see a meaningful rebound. Some analysts say the crypto market is at an inflection point, where the positive catalysts this year have been priced in while there is increasing uncertainty about the outlook.\n\u201cHow the market behaves over the next several days will signal whether this becomes a deeper reset or just a sharp, temporary dip in an otherwise intact cycle,\u201d Rafique at OKX said.\nSome crypto investors are still optimistic. Bitcoin in April had tumbled as low as about $74,500 before surging above $126,000 in early October.\n\u201cRight now, some investors see sideways churn and get spooked,\u201d said Ryan Rasmussen, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management. \u201cBut in our view it\u2019s the perfect opportunity for investors to build on existing bitcoin positions, and for those who have been sidelined to enter the market.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s John Liu contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/18\/business\/bitcoin-price-crypto-stocks","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

That helped boost the Dow, which is less exposed to the tech and AI wave. Twenty-six out of 30 companies in the blue-chip Dow closed higher on Tuesday.\nA potential end to the government shutdown would also mean the subsequent release of key economic data on the job market and inflation that had been delayed. The return to regularly scheduled releases of data can also provide a boost of certainty and confidence for investors.\nIn the last 15 government shutdowns going back to 1981, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 2.7% in the month after the government reopened, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\nJos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said in a note: \u201cA finalized deal later this week is expected to drive stocks to stronger advances, as a significant economic risk is pushed to the rear-view mirror and replaced with improved prospects for the holiday season.\u201d\nThe Senate sent a funding bill to the House.

Now stocks are back within reach of a record high.\nThank the Federal Reserve.\nThe market has rebounded from a dip in early November as investors have leaned into bets that the Fed will cut interest rates this week at its last policy meeting of the year.\nInterest-rate cuts can boost stocks by lowering savings rates and borrowing costs for individuals and businesses, in turn encouraging spending and investing, spurring business activity and increasing corporate earnings.\nFed rate cuts can also lower the yield on short-term government bonds and cash equivalents like money market funds, making higher-yielding assets like stocks more attractive to investors.\nAll told, interest-rate cuts can create a strong tailwind for stocks.\nJonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG, said in a Monday note that the stock market\u2019s recent rise has coincided with increasing odds for a Fed rate cut in December.\nTraders on Monday were pricing in an 89% chance the Fed cuts rates, according to CME FedWatch.\n\u201cMarkets have essentially seen a complete reversal of November\u2019s weakness,\u201d Krinsky said. \u201cThis has coincided almost in lock-step with rate-cut odds for the upcoming December (Fed) meeting.\u201d\nThe Fed is cutting rates in response to concerns about a weakening labor market. But for investors, lower rates can provide fuel for stocks to rally.\nThe Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate influences a range of interest rates across the economy. A Fed rate cut can lead to lower financing costs for a broad range of companies.\nThe Russell 2000, a market index of smaller companies that are more rate-sensitive, hit a record high on December 4.\n\u201cWhen you look at the firms that are more vulnerable and are smaller, like those in the Russell 2000, when you have lower rates, their interest expenses drop heavily, and that widens their profit margins,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers. \u201cThat\u2019s really why areas like real estate, manufacturing and small businesses benefit a lot more from lower rates.\u201d\nTo be sure, while investors have embraced hopes for a rate cut this week, Wall Street is always forward-looking, and there is less certainty about the path of rate cuts in January.\nThe Fed on Wednesday will release its quarterly summary of economic projections, which lays out \u2014 anonymously \u2014 officials\u2019 expectations for the course of interest rates across the coming months.\n\u201cAs the (Fed) considers additional rate cuts at its meeting this week and into 2026, reaccelerating inflation would likely force a slower, more cautious path,\u201d Jayson Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, said in a note.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/09\/business\/us-stock-market-federal-reserve-rate-decision","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

Gold and silver \u2014 safe havens during uncertain times \u2014 aresoaring higher.\nInvestors are worried about trade wars, signs of anAI bubbleand now credit market turmoil.\nWith all the uncertainty, it can feel overwhelming. However, long-term investors are best off keeping calm, tuning out the noise and sticking to a consistent plan that aligns with their financial goals, experts say.\n\u201cRather than trying to time the next downturn, the smarter move is to stick to fundamentals,\u201d said Jared Gagne, a wealth manager at Claro Advisors.\n\u201cGood investing is boring,\u201d he said.\nUS stockshave been on arecord-breaking rally, rebounding sharply after tumbling in the spring over concerns about President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. And Wall Street strategists say stocks have more room to run, with better-than-expected corporate earnings and Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts supporting stocks.\nStill, concerns are lingering about a stock market bubble andhistorically expensive valuations.\nIt\u2019s essential for investors to maintain a well-diversified portfolio with target allocations for each asset. An example of a classic portfolio includes 60% stocks, 30% bonds, 5% commodities like gold and 5% cash.\n\u201cKeep a diversified portfolio, rebalance when positions get stretched and continue investing on a disciplined schedule,\u201d Gagne said.\n\u201cIf one part of your portfolio has ballooned, consider trimming back to your target allocation rather than making wholesale exits,\u201d he said. \u201cThis keeps gains aligned with your long-term plan while taking some profit off the table.\u201d\nYounger investors, who have time to make up for any market dips, can probably stand to have more in riskier assets like stocks; investors nearing retirement, who might need their money sooner and likely don\u2019t have the same time to compensate for a market downturn, should have more more in bonds and cash-equivalents like Treasury bills.\n\u201cMake sure that you\u2019re in an investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals,\u201d said Ryan Kenny, portfolio manager at Crestwood Advisors. \u201cOne that\u2019s predicated on quality and diversification and being in something that allows you to ride out the volatility that it is inherent in markets.\u201d\nDollar cost averaging, when investors buy stocks at consistent intervals over time, can also help smooth out market ups and downs.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good way to give yourself a discipline and not get kind of swept up in the heat of the moment,\u201d said Tim Thomas, chief investment officer at Badgley Phelps Wealth Managers.\nTiming the market by predicting where stocks will go is an exceptionally rare skill \u2014 and doing it consistently over long periods is even harder. For the vast majority of investors, staying put is much better than trying to sell or buy at peak opportunities.\nThe S&P 500 has rallied 30% since April. Investors who sold in the market panic that month missed out on those monster gains.\n\u201cTiming the market successfully requires being correct twice: 1) knowing the right time to exit and 2) the most opportune time to reenter,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. \u201cInvestors are better off reminding themselves of the speed with which the market tends to recover from declines.\u201d\nHistory shows that the S&P 500 tends to rise in the long-term, rewarding investors who stay in the market. Since World War II, it has taken an average of four months from the bottom of a decline of up to 20% to get back to breakeven, Stovall said.\n\u201cThe investors who focus on time in the market, not timing the market, are the ones who have the most success investing,\u201d Gagne at Claro Advisors said.\nAs with all things in investing, there is no one-size-fits-all. Each person has their own financial goals and tolerance for risk.\nBut whatever your plan, it\u2019s important to stick with it consistently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to keep emotions out of it and have a system that\u2019s repeatable no matter what\u2019s going on in the market environment,\u201d Thomas of Badgley Phelps Wealth Managers said. \u201cJust keeping a level head is the key to success.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/20\/business\/investing-stocks-record-highs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"How America\u2019s biggest retailers are preparing for an unpredictable holiday season","date":"2025-11-26","body":"America\u2019s biggest stores are taking big swings this holiday season, trying to stand out and attract cautious consumers. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, sticky inflation and rising unemployment are prompting Americans to be more careful with their holiday spending.\nWells Fargo projects this year\u2019s holiday sales will rise between 3.5% and 4% from last year. But that doesn\u2019t account for higher prices due to inflation, so actual spending could be flat.\n\u201cThis year is really back to basics and leveraging strong merchandising, strong discounting, and making sure that (retailers are) getting their customers in the door this holiday,\u201d Wells Fargo retail analyst Lauren Murphy told CNN.\nThe legacy department store Macy\u2019s is revamping the in-store experience to win over wary shoppers. Budget-friendly Old Navy is leveraging its couture-designer-turned-chief-creative-officer Zac Posen. And even the world\u2019s largest retailer, Walmart, is promising a 30-minute turnaround from online order to the delivery truck.\nExecutives at all three companies told CNN that, regardless of  higher prices, they\u2019re working to help customers stretch their dollars and get more for their money.\nMacy\u2019s is going back to its roots; hoping to transport customers to the days of glitzy department stores.\nIn its New York City flagship store, a half-dozen partnershipsare waiting for customers, including an NBA Experience and exclusive Disney collaboration. The store itself is decked out with holiday lights and decorations, boasting an indoor holiday market, DJ and new brands on display.\nMacy\u2019s iconic Thanksgiving Day Parade Santa, who usually arrives at the end of the parade to kick off the holiday season, is even going on his first ever tour to different stores around the country.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen around the customer is they\u2019re much more choiceful,\u201d Macy\u2019s chief merchandising officer, Nata Dvir, told CNN. \u201cI think there\u2019s so many places for them to shop, so (we are) really making sure that it\u2019s coupled not only with great product, but having the quality and the value and the experience that comes with it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a purposeful bet, putting to the test a multiyear initiative to attract customers and revamp Macy\u2019s remaining locations. The mid-range department store has fended offactivist investorsamid slumping sales. Last year, Macy\u2019sannounced it was closing 150 underperforming storesby 2026 while investing customer service and inventory in its remaining 350 locations.\nThe plan seemed to be working. Macy\u2019s recently posted its first sales growth in three years. But like all retailers, it now has to grapple with tariffs.\nThe chain plans for the holidays nearly a year in advance, sourcing items from more than 25 countries. Macy\u2019s worked with vendors to keep prices low in as many categories as possible. But still, some increases will happen for products like toys and sweaters, Dvir said.\n\u201cWhile we saw the tariffs coming towards us, what we tried to do was really offset what that cost (was) by putting more into the product,\u201d she told CNN.\nThat means investing in elevated fabrics, like cashmere, so customers will hopefully think the quality is worth the cost.\nAs the holiday season marches on, Macy\u2019s is using its own economists to help translate what the latest economic data will mean for customers. That way, Macy\u2019s can pivot on assortment and pricing.\n\u201cIt is a science, but there\u2019s a little art that goes into it as well,\u201d Dvir said.\nMillions of units. Twenty-two designs. $5 pajama pants.\nIf the holiday season is Old Navy\u2019s \u201cSuper Bowl,\u201d as CEO Horacio Barbeito described it, its family pajamas are its winning touchdown. The seasonal jammies is a multimillion dollar business and one of the company\u2019s biggest eventsin terms of sales volume.\nBut Old Navy, with stores in 49 out of 50 states, will need more than festive pajamas to reach cost-burdened consumers this holiday season. So, it\u2019s also betting on its first designer collection with Anna Sui and new styles conceived by one of America\u2019s best-known couture fashion designers, Zac Posen \u2013 now, Old Navy\u2019s chief creative officer.\n\u201cThis was the opportunity of a lifetime. This is the brand that dresses America,\u201d Posen told CNN inside Old Navy\u2019s Times Square location. Posen pointed out the specific features he crafted for the clothing on the shelves, such as bow-tie shoulder straps and pockets on a taffeta holiday dress.\nOld Navy is an essential part of parent Gap Inc. The company reported better-than-expected earnings in its third quarter, with a 5% year-over-year revenue rise for Old Navy alone.\nBut customers are being careful with spending, and tariffs still loom over Old Navy\u2019s merchandise. The retailer has introduced RFID technology that allows associates to know what\u2019s in stock and locate it in stores, helping to find products quickly and keep customers from walking out of the store and losing a sale.\n\u201cIn our industry, it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d Barbeito said.\nThe CEO insists Old Navy\u2019s focus on value means it will \u201cnot participate\u201d in the swirling uncertainty in the economy. Posen said the brand will persevere no matter what\u2019s issues it faces.\n\u201cEvery year has its challenges. Sometimes it\u2019s the economy, sometimes it\u2019s the weather, sometimes it\u2019s a change of an administration,\u201d Posen said. \u201cAt the end of the day people want to look good, they want to feel good, and that line continues and I think when things can be more challenging, we rise to the occasion.\u201d\nIn Greencastle, Pennsylvania, sits a 1.5 million square foot fulfillment center where machines do most of the processing and packaging of online order.\nAI-powered machines make custom boxes for each order, sort the product and tapes the box shut. Associateswork with the machines surrounded by the quiet hum of automation.\nOne of four so-called NexGen fulfillment centers across the country, this brand new facility is part of Walmart\u2019s plans to win customers this holiday season by being the speediest. America\u2019s largest retailer said the center can process 100,000 packages a day.\n\u201cWhen you click buy, we can actually get it out of the internet onto a trailer going to your house within 30 minutes,\u201d Barat Smith, vice president of operations for Walmart\u2019s US su\ufeffpply chain, told CNN.\nWalmart is heading into this holiday season with a head start thanks to its strong earnings. Revenue rose 5.8% in the most recent quarter, with a 27% hike in e-commerce alone. As prices have risen since the Covid-19 pandemic, Walmart has attracted more middle- to higher-income shoppers looking for a bargain.\nBut Walmart faces obvious competition in the realm of online shopping this holiday season \u2013 juggernaut Amazon as well as affordable Chinese drop-shippers like Temu and Shein.\n\u201cWe focus on operating at everyday low cost so that we can deliver everyday low prices on a consistent basis,\u201d David Guggina, Walmart\u2019sexecutive vice president and chief e-commerce officer, told CNN. \u201cIn this respect, we\u2019re talking about speed. If we create a great customer experience that drives more orders, and more orders drives density, and density allows us to lower our cost to operate.\u201d\nThese fulfillment centers are twice as productive as Walmart\u2019s older facilities and move half of all the company\u2019s volume.\nWalmart associates interact with packages just five times compared to the legacy fulfillment centers, which have 12 employee steps.\n\u201cAnd some of our other facilities, we can walk up to 10 miles a day for our associates. Now the furthest they walk is from their car into their workstation,\u201d Smith said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/26\/business\/shopping-stores-holiday-preparation-christmas","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Think the stock rally is over? It may just be beginning","date":"2025-10-27","body":"The stock market rally has already defied expectations this year, shrugging off geopolitical strife, economic uncertainty and global trade tensions to reach fresh record highs. Some analysts say the rally might just be getting started.\nThe Dow closed above47,000 pointsfor the first time ever on Friday, buoyed by cooler-than-expectedinflation datathat supported hopes for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\nThe S&P 500 has rallied 36% in just over six months, boosted by strong corporate earnings and optimism about Fed rate cuts. Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence had stokedbubble concernsbut also contributed to the market\u2019s ascent.\n\u201cAbsent some truly surprising and unwelcome events, the current momentum in the stock market is likely to last through the end of the year,\u201d Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO at Bowersock Capital Partners, said in an email.\nStocks are historically expensive and US-China trade tensions persist. While there\u2019s no shortage of concerns, the outlook remains positive for stocks, analysts said.\nThe bottom line: Corporate profitscontinue to impressWall Street, and the Fed is expected to lower interest rates, providing legs for a rally.\nCompanies are expected to deliver strong results this quarter, driven by \u201cabove trend growth\u201d from AI companies, AI-related investments and a resilient consumer, analysts at JPMorgan Chase said in an October 21 note.\nAbout 86% of companies in the S&P 500 that have already reported third-quarter earnings have posted results that beat expectations, according to FactSet.\nThe S&P 500 posted a historically strong September and is on track to notch its sixth month of gains in a row. But even that extraordinary growth doesn\u2019t rule out further gains, investors said.\nA fear of missing out on the rally, or FOMO, is also keeping stocks float, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n\u201cWith the Fed likely to cut rates two more times this year, and with AI collaborations continuing, I think right now, we are trading on FOMO fumes,\u201d Stovall said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re running on adrenaline,\u201d he said. \u201cValuations are still stretched, but at least in the near term, things are still looking good.\u201d\nOf course, it\u2019s not all upside.\nIt\u2019s a \u201chigh risk bull market,\u201d according to Bob Doll, CEO at Crossmark Global Investments.\nThe labor market has shownsigns of weakeningin recent months. While consumer spending has held up so far, Doll said he is still concerned about a slowdown in spending \u2014 and a knock to corporate profits \u2014 if softness in the job market continues.\nWall Street will also be fixated on whether big tech companies can continue to impress with earnings. The Magnificent Seven group of tech stocks have accounted for roughly 41% of the S&P 500\u2019s gains this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nJamie Dimon is worried about a stock market correction\nMeta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) are expected to report earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are expected to report earnings on Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA), the star of the AI show, reports earnings on November 19.\nTesla (TSLA) reported earnings on October 22, and its profits missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Tesla shares are down about 1% since it reported earnings.\n\u201cWhile the bull case is potentially potent, we are not convinced that the rising tide will sufficiently lift all boats in terms of upside profit surprise,\u201d Lisa Shalett, CIO at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in a note.\nThe stock market has proved more resilient this year than many on Wall Street thought.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s tariff campaign has raised concerns about a slowdown in economic growth and resurgent inflation, but investors have tried to look past concerns and focus on corporate earnings.\nMeanwhile, inflation data so far has been milder than expected. While the economy is showing signs of strain, likeborrowers falling behind on car payments, the stock market has pushed higher.\n\u201cNext year will bring new challenges, but we wouldn\u2019t advise getting in the way of the upward trend between now and year-end,\u201d Chris Zaccarelli, CIO at Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.\nJust this month, the Dow dropped900 pointson October 10 after President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on China before recouping those losses and closing at a record high two weeks later.\nTrump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to meet this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. Tensions have flared since Beijing on October 9 announced new export controls on rare earths and Trump the next day threatened new 100% tariffs, set to take effect November 1.\nIf there were to be a further escalation in US-China trade tensions, it could be another opportunity to buy the dip, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist.\n\u201cIf something actually all of a sudden becomes more tense, and both sides dig in, and that\u2019s kind of a short-term risk,\u201d Lerner said, \u201cWe would be leaning into that risk if it were to happen.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/27\/investing\/us-stock-market-rally","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"What bubble? The analysts and investors making the bull case for AI","date":"2025-11-27","body":"Chipmaker Nvidia posted yet another blockbuster earnings report this month.\nThe stock fell anyway, as many investors worry that the market is in the middle of an about-to-burst AI bubble.\nBut for AI\u2019s biggest believers, the report was just another sign that the industry\u2019s train isn\u2019t running out of steam anytime soon.\n\u201cFears of an AI Bubble are way overstated in our view,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note last week. The Nvidia earnings report \u201cis another validation point for the AI Revolution and (in) our view we are in the Top of the 3rd inning of this AI game  .\u201d\nThe possibility of an AI bubble has loomed over the tech industry and Wall Street for years, but worries have ramped up sharply this year. Massive AI infrastructure spending, a string of circular deals among a few key big tech companies and seemingly endless rhetoric about AI\u2019s world-changing potential \u2013 with little profit to show for it \u2013 have sparked concerns that we\u2019re in for another dot-com-style bubble bursting.\nAbout forty percent of the S&P 500 isnow made up of 10 tech companies, including Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, Oracle, Alphabet and Microsoft \u2013 all of which are betting big on an AI revolution.\nThere\u2019s a lot at stake: The bursting of the dot-com bubble helped cause the 2001 recession and led theNasdaq to lose over 75% of its valueby late 2002.\nBut some analysts say investors should actually keep piling into AI. They argue there\u2019s a big difference between AI and the dot-com era, when many early internet companies failed to find lucrative and steady business models, with notable exceptions like Amazon and eBay. AI companies, on the other hand, already have healthy business models or viable paths to profitability, they argue.\n\u201cThe lesson of the dot com era is there was a bubble, it burst. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re in one now for AI,\u201d Bob Michele, JP Morgan\u2019s chief investment officer and head of the global fixed income, currency and commodities group,\u201d said on CNBC last week.\nAnd AI has far more potential to make money, Ravi Mhatre, co-founder of Lightspeed Venture Partners, told CNN. LSVP is a major backer of AI company Anthropic.\n\u201cThe scale of revenue growth happening in this cycle is exponentially greater than prior cycles,\u201d he said.\nRapid advancements in AI models also mean more uses are regularly popping up for the technology, Mhatre said.\nTech companies are already seeing increased cloud demand and productivity gains, especially in areas like coding and advertising. And there are plenty of growth markets geared to consumers \u2013  ChatGPT recently addeda new toolto help shoppers research purchases, for example. But whether that growth will outpace costs, especially for smaller companies, remains  a big question.\nSome investors believe the AI industry is at the beginning of a \u201csuper cycle\u201d decade (or more) of innovation, investment and revenue. That could mean a global economy dominated and fundamentally changed by AI, they say.\n\u201cI tend to believe that the AI super cycle is real, that it is going to have a pretty profound impact on the economy, but you have to make room for the full range of outcomes when we price these things,\u201d Marta Norton, Empower\u2019s chief investment strategist, told Bloomberg Television last week.\nMhatre said there\u2019s a bubble in that a rush of investments is chasing momentum that may not prove successful. But the industry itself might not be in a bubble.\n\u201cI do think both things are true. We\u2019re in a hype cycle,\u201d Mhatre said. \u201cOn the other hand, this kind of scale and speed with which value is getting created is also radically different than the prior cycles, where I just think the time that it took people to build technology and for it to be diffused was longer.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/27\/tech\/ai-bubble-analysts-bull-case","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

Choose your own Wall Street adventure!","date":"2025-10-17","body":"The stock market issending mixed signalsat the moment, caught in a tangle of overlapping anxieties. Predicting its next move depends heavily on which narrative you want to believe.\nYou could choose door No. 1 and subscribe to the dominant concern of the week: A number of high-profile bankruptcies in consumer-facing industries may have exposed an underlying economic weakness thatthreatens parts of the banking sector.\nA small number of regional banks have reported some bad loans this past week. The bankruptcies of a major auto parts company and a subprime auto lender have exposed bigger lenders, including JPMorgan and Wall Street finance company Jefferies, to potentially significant losses.\nA number of the lenders are alleging they were victims of fraud. But if you believe these are canaries in the coal mine \u2013 and not a series of isolated incidents \u2013 it might mean a growing number of consumers won\u2019t be able to pay back their loans or may rein in their spending with companies that owe banks a bunch of money. That could drag down lenders that are most susceptible if the economy really starts to take a turn for the worse.\nTo paraphrase JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week, these bank problems may becockroachesthat could signal the presence of other hidden cockroaches.\nMarkets hit their most recent record just last Wednesday. But they started to stumble after Chinaramped up export controlson keyrare-earth mineralsthat the Trump administration has been negotiating for months to free up. Those rare-earths are used in practically everything that beeps, including consumer electronics and military equipment.\nPresident Donald Trump last Friday said he\u2019s had enough, threatening a major re-escalation of the global trade war. He said he\u2019dsend China\u2019s tariffs higherby 100 percentage points and saw no need to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a high-profile planned meeting in South Korea later this month.\nTrump and his administration quickly walked back those threats, confirming a Xi meeting was still on. And today Trump said he understood significantly higher tariffs on China wouldn\u2019t be sustainable.\nBut Trump has changed his mind on tariffs before, and it\u2019s too soon to count out amajor escalation in trade tensions. If that happens, Morgan Stanley analysts predicted the market could quickly tumble 11% into a correction.\nBig Tech and the promise of AI have fueled the historic rise in stocks this year, particularly since April. But analysts have warned in recent months that this is a one-legged stool \u2013 and AI companies\u2019 high valuations can\u2019t support the market forever.\nSome see echoes of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s that went bust in the early 2000s. Stocks have never been pricier as measured by the ratio of share price to companies\u2019 actual sales. And the top eight most valuable stocks on the market \u2013 all worth north of $1 trillion \u2013 are all heavily invested in AI.\nAll that froth suggests to some that valuations have gotten out of whack with reality, and the AI-powered gains are due for a serious reality check.\nStill, bubbles are notoriously hard to predict, and Wall Street\u2019s majority opinion appears to be that the run-up in AI stocks as just the beginning of a long-run trend that will power the stock market for many years to come.\nInvestors have largely ignored the economic impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs over the past six months, as prognosticators\u2019 worst predictions about high inflation and a slowing economy have failed to come to fruition.\nHowever,inflationison the rise, albeit slowly. Hiring hasslowed to a crawl. Trade with the United States has slowed due to higher tariffs. And some consumers have been jostled by rising prices, with delinquencies and subprime debt rising for lower-income tiers.\nIronically, cracks in the economy have helped drive stocks higher, because the underperforming job market forced the wait-and-see Federal Reserve to lose patience and start its recent rate-cutting campaign.\nBut the Fed may not be able to cut rates for long if so-calledstagflation\u2013 high inflation and stagnant economic growth \u2013 becomes a real concern. At that point, the Fed may be forced to deal with an inflation problem all over again.\nGeopolitical tensions could be easing in Ukraine and the Middle East, and meetings are lined up between Trump and his Chinese counterpart; and with Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin. As with the recent ceasefire in Gaza, those meetings have the potential to turn down the temperature, at least somewhat, in some of the most concerning parts of the globe.\nMeanwhile, worries about oversupply have pressured the oil market, with the price of Brent and WTI both at near five-month lows \u2013 potentially easing the inflation burden for Americans, if gas prices follow oil prices lower.\nAnd the latest concerns about regional banks, though bringing back bad memories of a couple years ago, may prove to be as contained as theregional bank crisis of 2023.\nMore bad headlines may continue to jostle the markets in the near-term. But not much has really changed: Stocks are down just about 2% from their record high. If they fall further, that could present a good buying opportunity to get back into the market when stocks are relatively cheap.\n\u201cWe would view deeper pullbacks as opportunities to lean in, as the bull market still deserves the benefit of the doubt,\u201d said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist, in a note to clients Friday\nPut another way: \u201cWe are keeping our powder dry and ready to buy the dip,\u201d said Mohit Kumar, chief economist at Jefferies.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/17\/investing\/wall-street-economy-concerns","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Why some elite investors are turning on the darling of the AI rally","date":"2025-11-18","body":"A version of this story appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nThree prominent investors with almost nothing in common are dumping their shares of Nvidia, the computer chip juggernaut that went from relative obscurity to the world\u2019s first $5 trillion valuation in just three years.\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate Nvidia\u2019s superlatives. On its own it makes up 8% of the total value of the S&P 500. Its annual net income grew more than 580% between 2023 and 2024. It\u2019s become almost a joke on Wall Street that the company consistently blows past expectations, notching quarter after quarter of financial gains, thanks to seemingly bottomless demand for Nvidia\u2019s sophisticated chips, which are key to building artificial intelligence models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT or Anthropic\u2019s Claude.\nSo why sell now? Isn\u2019t betting against Nvidia now a bit like betting against the 1995 Bulls? (As in, you\u2019d be out of your mind to do so)?\nMaybe not. There are any number of reasons why investors would sell Nvidia, but the timing of these recent moves is fueling concerns that the company \u2014 and by extension, the entire AI industry \u2014 is part of aspeculative bubblethat\u2019s bound to burst.\nOn Monday, a regulatory filing showed tech billionaire Peter Thiel\u2019s hedge fund had, sometime in the three months ending in September, sold itsentirestake in Nvidia \u2014 all 537,742 shares, which would be worth about $100 million as of September 30, the last day of the quarter. The disclosure, three days ahead of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings release, rattled investors, who are already nervous about when, or whether, they\u2019ll see a return on their AI investments.\nThiel\u2019s revelation came days after Japanese conglomerate SoftBank said it had sold all of its Nvidia holdings for $5.8 billion. And earlier this month, Michael Burry \u2014 the \u201cBig Short\u201d investor who anticipated the housing market\u2019s collapse in 2008 \u2014 disclosed that his hedge fund had bought $9.2 million in \u201cput\u201d options against Nvidia and Palantir, another AI darling, essentially wagering that their stocks will fall.\nWhat do Thiel, Burry and SoftBank know about Nvidia that the rest of us don\u2019t?

But they also needed to gin up a bunch of cash soon to complete a nearly $23 billion investment in OpenAI, prompting them to take their Nvidia profits.\nBurry\u2019s position is a much more skeptical one. In a post on X, Burry wrote that he believes Big Tech companies are\u201cunderstating depreciation\u201daround Nvidia\u2019s core product \u2014 essentially, they\u2019ll soon be sitting on a bunch of equipment that\u2019s obsolete, and they\u2019re undervaluing how much that will hurt their bottom line.\nRepresentatives for Thiel, a co-founder of surveillance software giant Palantir and a guy whoreportedly believesthat strictly regulating AI tech will hasten the arrival of the Antichrist, did not respond to a request for comment. Thiel has previously staked out a fairly conservative position on AI,tellingthe New York Times\u2019 Ross Douthat that the technology is \u201cmore than a nothing burger\u201d but \u201cless than the total transformation of our society.\u201d\nThe timing of these moves \u2014 coming the same quarter that Nvidia hit $5 trillion in market value (it\u2019s now back down to a measly $4.5 trillion) \u2014 may be purely coincidental.

{"title":"Wall Street is making some seriously weird trades","date":"2025-06-12","body":"Wall Street traders hunting for profits might find that the most lucrative investments are in the peculiar market for precious metals.\nGold, silver and platinum prices have surged this year as investors have piled into precious metals in search of places to hide from trade war uncertainty.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic tariff plan has rocked markets, and investors have tried to minimize risk by putting some money in safe haven assets. While gold is historically considered a haven, demand for havens has spilled over into its wonky cousins like silver and platinum.\nThe metals craze is reflected in the numbers: Precious metals are trouncing the US stock market this year. Gold has soared 27.5%, silver is up 24% and platinum has surged a whopping 36%.\nMeanwhile, after rising by 23% last year and 24% in 2023, the S&P 500 is up less than 3% so far this year; there is an unusual amount of jitters inthe normally staid bond market; and the US dollar hasbroadly weakenedafter rising 7% last year.\nRelated articleThe world\u2019s second-largest gold storage suddenly has very long lines to withdraw bars\nAs bonds have been volatile and the dollar has weakened amid tariff turmoil, weird investments like silver and platinum have emerged as a way to hedge against the tremendous uncertainty.\n\u201cThese dynamics have further incentivized investors to diversify away from traditional financial instruments and toward tangible assets,\u201d Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a Friday note.\n\u201cGold continues to be the primary haven,\u201d Hansen added, \u201cbut with bullion demand showing signs of stalling as investors look for a fresh trigger to propel prices higher, we have instead in recent weeks seen heightened interest in silver (and) platinum.\u201d\nSilver and platinum prices have surged higher in recent weeks as investors have sought ways to diversify their portfolios. Supply constraints have also pushed prices higher, Hansen said, and the metals increasingly look like a \u201crational hedge against political and financial instability.\u201d\n\u201cThese commodities are viewed as politically neutral; unlike sovereign bonds or foreign currencies, they carry no counterparty risk and are not tied to any nation\u2019s credit rating,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cWhile we remain cautious about predicting an imminent surge to new all-time highs, the macroeconomic backdrop is increasingly supportive of precious metals.\u201d\nPrecious metal prices have also pushed higher as investors have picked up on budding rallies, building a momentum-driven trend, according to Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.\nBank of America\u2019s survey of global fund managers in May showed that gold was the most crowded trade for the second month in a row. That snapped the Magnificent Seven tech stocks\u2019 24-month streak as the most crowded trade.\nDuring the first quarter of the year, gold posted its strongest quarterly return since 1986. The yellow metal is up 27.5% this year, following its 27% surge from last year.\nGold surged higher this year as investors fretted over the uncertain outlook for tariffs.\nSpot gold prices in April briefly rose above arecord highof $3,500 a troy ounce. Gold traded around $3,350 a troy ounce as of Wednesday.\nGold is considered a resilient investment and a hedge against inflation, with investors betting it will retain its value when prices rise.\nWhile Wall Street has gold fever, the price of gold has also been boosted by central banks around the world, including in India and China, buying bullion to add to their reserves. Gold demand from central banks was a key driver of its price surge in 2024, according to the World Gold Council, a trade group.\nAnother factor driving gold prices higher has been a weaker US dollar, Sosnick said. When the dollar weakens, commodities like gold tend to perform well as it becomes cheaper for foreign investors to buy bullion.\nThe US dollar index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against six major foreign currencies, is down almost 9% this year.\n\u201cGold continues to consolidate above $3,300, underpinned by persistent geopolitical risks, uncertainty on trade and a soft dollar,\u201d said Peter A. Grant, vice president and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals, in a Tuesday note.\nAs gold has soared higher, silver has started to catch up. Spot silver prices have surged 24% this year after soaring 21% in 2024.\nSilver this week crossed $36 a troy ounce and hit its highest level since 2012.\nMichael DiRienzo, president and CEO at the industry group Silver Institute, told CNN that silver prices have surged higher due to industrial demand and heightened economic uncertainty.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of concern about the global economy, and when that happens, people turn to hard assets like silver,\u201d DiRienzo said.\n\u201cSilver tends to follow gold upwards,\u201d he added.\nSilver is widely used for industrial purposes, including data centers, solar panels and smartphones, and uncertainty about tariffs has caused demand for silver to surge, DiRienzo said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really reverting back to its dual use as an industrial metal and as a precious metal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd both sides of the ledger are kind of coming together to push this price forward.\u201d\nSustained demand for silver, driven by investors and industry, could push the metal to record highs, according to commodities research firm CPM Group.\n\u201cSilver offers an attractive entry point for investors seeking alternatives to high-priced gold, bolstered by its extensive industrial applications,\u201d analysts at CPM Group said in a May note.\nPeople can invest in silver or gold in the form of bars and coins, or in the form of exchange-traded funds. The iShares Silver Trust ETF has surged 25% this year alongside the price of silver. The SPDR Gold Trust ETF has surged 27% this year.\nSosnick at Interactive Brokers said he also thinks silver\u2019s rise has been momentum-driven as traders have tried to join in on the rally.\nPlatinum has also surged alongside silver as a less costly investment than gold.\nPlatinum has gained a whopping 36%this year after falling almost 10% across 2024. Spot platinum prices this week rose above $1,200 a troy ounce and hit their highest level since 2021.\n\u201cWhile gold has dominated the performance of the metals complex over the last year, we are starting to see the laggards like platinum \u2026 emerge from bases to catch-up a bit,\u201d said Jonathan Krinsky, chief markets technician at global financial services firm BTIG, in a recent note.\nThe precious metal, which is used inindustriesincluding automotive and jewelry, has rallied largely due to demand exceeding supply. Platinum has surged higher in recent weeks after the World Platinum Investment Council, a trade group, projected a deficit for the third year in a row.\n\u201cThis anticipated shortfall, which will draw down existing above-ground inventories, is being driven by demand from the automotive sector and, notably, a surge in Chinese interest in jewelry, bars and coins,\u201d Saxo Bank\u2019s Hansen said.\n\u201cJewelers are the second-biggest platinum buyer after the auto industry,\u201d analysts at Bank of America said in a Friday note. \u201cAfter years of declining demand, there is anecdotal evidence that interest in platinum jewelry is now bouncing back in China.\u201d\n\u201cRising gold prices are incentivizing jewelers to diversify, in what represents a change to historical patterns,\u201d the analysts noted.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/12\/investing\/us-stock-market-gold-bitcoin-silver","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

The broader S&P 500 was down by 4.84% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 5.97%. All three major indexes posted their biggest single-day drop since 2020.\nGlobal marketsalso fell sharply Thursday. Europe\u2019s benchmark STOXX 600 index tumbled 2.57%, erasing its gains since January. Germany\u2019s DAX index fell 3%. France\u2019s benchmark index slumped 3.31%, its biggest single-day drop since July 2023.

Tariffs in theory should boost the dollar, but investors\u2019 concerns that the United States is creating a self-inflicted wound that would stymie its long-term growth sent the dollar sinking against other global currencies.\n\u201cThey\u2019re ignoring every rule of classic micro and macro economics. This is the policymaking equivalent of a suicide bomber,\u201d Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital, told CNN\u2019s Matt Egan.\nRelated live storyStocks in major decline as Trump\u2019s tariffs spark global trade war\nTreasury bond yields fell sharply after Trump\u2019s announcement on Wednesday and continued to slide Thursday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.05% Thursday, its lowest level since October. Bond yields and prices trade in opposite directions.\nChip Hughey, managing director for fixed income at Truist Advisory Services, said investors snapped up bonds because of concerns about \u201cthe drag that the policy uncertainty plus stricter tariffs will have on growth going forward.\u201d\nInvestors poured money into safe-haven assets. Gold surged to a new record Wednesday above $3,160 a troy ounce. Gold, which hovered above $3,100 a troy ounce Thursday, is up 19% this year and just posted its best quarter since 1986.\nThe S&P 500 closed in correction, down 12.17% from its record high in February (a correction means down more than 10% from a recent high). The Nasdaq, which has been in correction, closed down 17.96% from its record high in December. The Dow closed down 9.93% from its record high in December, approaching correction territory.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt during a CNN interview Thursday tried to calm investors\u2019 worries about the impact of President Donald Trump\u2018s decision to impose tariffs of at least 10% across all countries.\n\u201cTo anyone on Wall Street this morning, I would say trust in President Trump,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cThis is a president who is doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first term.\u201d\nStocks leading US markets lower included companies that rely on international supply chains that will be subject tariffs. Apple (AAPL) sank 9.3%. Nike (NKE) tumbled 14.4%. Best Buy (BBY) plunged 17.8% and Ralph Lauren (RL) tanked 16.3%.\nApple shed over $310 billion in market value from market close on Wednesday to market close on Thursday, according to FactSet data.\nWall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, surged 39.6% on Thursday. \u201cExtreme fear\u201d was the sentiment driving markets, according toCNN\u2019s Fear and Greed Index. The Fear and Greed index slumped to its lowest level this year as tariff anxiety gripped investors.\nPresident Donald Trump shrugged off market reaction to his Wednesday tariffs announcement at the White House Thursday, telling reporters \u201cI think it\u2019s going very well.\u201d\n\u201cThe markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,\u201d Trump said on the South Lawn. \u201cAnd the rest of the world wants to see if there\u2019s any way that they can make a deal, they\u2019ve taken advantage of us for many many years, for many years we\u2019ve been at the wrong side of the ball, and I tell you what, I think it\u2019s going to be unbelievable.\u201d\nIf Trump maintains the massive tariffs he announced Wednesday, his unprecedented trade policies will probably cause the US and global economies to both fall into a recession in 2025, JPMorgan analysts said in a note to investors.\nThat\u2019s not exactly a shock: Prior to Trump\u2019s announcement Wednesday, JPMorgan analysts gave the US economy a 40% shot of entering a recession.\nRelated live storyTrump launches historic global trade war\nJPMorgan noted that the tariffs would hike taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year \u2014 the largest tax increase in recent memory by a long shot. It will cause prices to surge, too, adding 2% to the Consumer Price Index, a measure of US inflation that has struggled to come back down to earth in recent years.\n\u201cThe impact on inflation will be substantial,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cWe view the full implementation of these policies as a substantial macro economic shock.\u201d\nThe shock will be exacerbated by plunging consumer and business sentiment and by any retaliation visited upon America as foreign countries potentially impose new tariffs on the United States.\n\u201cWe thus emphasize that these policies, if sustained, would likely push the US and global economy into recession this year,\u201d the analysts said.\nOil prices plunged on Thursday on worries that Trump\u2019s trade war will slow the world economy and that OPEC is oversupplying the market. US oil futures settled at $66.95 a barrel, marking a 6.6% tumble. It was the biggest one-day decline for crude since July 2022.\nBrent crude, the world benchmark, plunged 6.4% \u2014 the biggest one-day drop since August 2022 \u2014 to finish the day at $70.14 a barrel.\nOPEC+ surprised investors on Thursday by announcing that Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members have agreed to sharply accelerate previously scheduled production increases starting in May.\nThe Business Roundtable, a powerful group of America\u2019s leading CEOs, warned Wednesday night that Trump\u2019s latest tariffs could backfire on their businesses.\n\u201cUniversal tariffs ranging from 10-50% run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters,\u201d Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten said in a statement. \u201cDamage to the US economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s massive new tariffs would send the US tariffs rate dramatically higher to levels unseen since around 1910, according to Fitch Ratings.\nTrump\u2019s aggressive tariff moves are set to lift the US tariffs rate from just 2.5% last year to 22%, according to Fitch.\nThat surpasses the roughly 20% tariff rate the United States charged following the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which set off a global trade war that economists say worsened the Great Depression.\n\u201cThis is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy,\u201d Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, wrote in a statement on Wednesday.\nSonola said \u201cmany\u201d nations will likely plunge into recession.\n\u201cYou can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time,\u201d the Fitch economist said.\nCNN\u2019s DJ Judd, Shania Shelton, Matt Egan and David Goldman contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/03\/investing\/us-stock-market","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Elon Musk reportedly plans massive IPO for SpaceX. Here\u2019s what that means","date":"2025-12-10","body":"Elon Musk, already the world\u2019s richest man, couldsoon bemuch richer. Bloomberg reports he\u2019s planning one of the largest initial public offerings in history for SpaceX.\nMusk\u2019s space company plans to raise $30 billion next year,Bloombergreported, and an IPO could value the company at up to $1.5 trillion. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment on the report.\nSpaceX has not had any trouble raising money despite being privately-held. But the ability to sell public shares could increase the cash flow into a company with ambitious, and exorbitantly expensive, plans.\nA Wall Street debut would give Musk the added benefit of increasing his already massive wealth. However, it would also bring outside scrutiny to how SpaceX conducts business, something that has rankled Musk during his time running Tesla.\nThe money raised would go to the company, not to Musk. But given that he reportedly owns nearly half the company\u2019s shares, it would significantly increase his net worth.\nA publicly-traded SpaceX means Musk could more easily borrow against the value of his stake in the company, as he has with his Tesla holdings. That frees up tax-free cash for his various endeavors.\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019sBillionaire Tracker, Musk currently has a net worth of $461 billion with most of that due to his Tesla shares and options. If SpaceX is worth $1.5 trillion,that net worth could more than double, according toBloomberg.\nSpaceX is at an inflection point. It has cornered most of the market for astronaut and satellite launches. And its constellation of Starlink microsatellites has turned the company into a major internet service provider.\nMore capital could help the company reach its more ambitious goals. (Even if its ultimate goal, a colony on Mars, proves to be technologically and economically prohibitive.)\nSpaceX\u2019s next generation of heavy rocket, dubbed \u201cStarship\u201d by the company, is a radical new approach to reaching outer space. But its still in development \u2013 and the rocket has suffered a number ofmishapsand explosions during testing that havecast doubt on Musk\u2019s ambitious timelines.\nGoing public would alsoallow current investors to cash out their stake in the company at a profit.\nSpaceX\u2019s business has drawn a wide spectrum of major investors, including Google parent Alphabet, financial giants such as Fidelity Investments, and prominent venture capital firms such as the Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Valor Equity Partners, and Andreessen Horowitz.\nThe company has raised $10 billion in funding already, according to Pitchbook. And any time it\u2019s raised funds, it\u2019s had more people clamoring to give it money than it needs.\nUnlike most other space companies, SpaceX has a positive cash flow, according to the most recent tweets from Musk.\nMusk said the Starlink business provides most of the company\u2019s current revenue.But it also has multibillion-dollar contracts to service the International Space Station as well as carry astronauts to the moon under NASA\u2019s program.\nStarship has suffered several explosive setbacks during uncrewed test flights in 2025. However, if successful, Starship is expected to underpin SpaceX\u2019s Mars ambitions, which include establishing a permanent settlement on the planet. Starship could also slash the price of carrying a kilogram of cargo to space by orders of magnitude.\nYes. And no one has been more focused on those downsides than Musk.\nGoing public could put investor pressure on the company\u2019s capital-intensive plans, which might not produce a return on any investment for years to come, if at all.\nIt also means greater oversight from the public, and scrutiny from regulators such as the Security and Exchange Commission, which Musk has battled with in the past. This is evident in how he\u2019s responded to scrutiny of Tesla. In 2018, Musk proposed taking Tesla private once again, a move he eventually abandoned.\nMusk has also regularly battled some investor groups. That includes analysts and short sellers (who make money by betting a stock will decline) as well with firms that advise institutional shareholders. He recently called such research firms \u201ccorporate terrorists.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/10\/business\/musk-spacex-ipo-faq","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

{"title":"\u2018Buying the dip\u2019 worked well in recent weeks, but Wall Street is cautious for a reason","date":"2025-05-28","body":"A divergence is taking hold in markets: While Wall Street issending money abroad, Main Street is leaning in to America, doubling down on a \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d strategy that has, for now, paid off.\nWall Street heavyweights continue to warn that the trade war could hurt the economy, posing a threat to markets. A Bank of America survey in April showed the largest number of global fund managers on record intending to decrease their holdings of US stocks. Seventy-three percent of respondents said they think US exceptionalism had peaked.\nYet retail investors, or individuals investing their own money, are giving stocks a big lift. They seemingly haven\u2019t cared much about what Wall Street thinks, and have steadily scooped up US stocks this year, including taking the steep market downturn in early April as a chance to buy while stocks were relatively cheap.\nAs individuals bought the dip while fund managers showed caution, Main Street and Wall Street split in their views of America\u2019s future \u2014 and its assets.\nThe divergence shows just how much uncertainty President Donald Trump has caused in his second term. Whether small-scale investors or deep-pocketed institutions come out on top is still in doubt as policy whiplash from the White House and a global trade war realign the world financial order.\nRetail investors on May 19 plowed $5.1 billion into US stocks, according to data from JPMorgan Chase. That\u2019s the largest daily inflow into stocks from retail investors on record since data collection began in 2015. Those buys helped push the market higher that day, posting its only day in the green that week.\nAnd retail traders bought a net $50 billion in stocks from April 8 to May 14, making them one of the top drivers of the market rally in late April, according to Emma Wu, a strategist at JPMorgan Chase.\n\u201cThe buy-the-dip strategy in early April has clearly paid off,\u201d Wu said in a May 15 note. Retail investors\u2019 portfolios were up an estimated 15.1% in the month after April 8 as the market rebounded, Wu said.\nIn contrast, a Bank of America survey in May showed global fund managers reduced their allocation to US stocks to their lowest level in two years. Additionally, fund managers\u2019 exposure to the dollar fell to a 19-year low.\nRetail investors helped the US market recover in recent weeks by buying the dip. Yet the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs has yet to show up in hard economic data, suggesting there could be more cracks in the health of the economy later this year.\nJamie Dimon, chief executive at JPMorgan Chase, said on May 20 at the company\u2019s investor day that markets are showing an \u201cextraordinary amount of complacency\u201d in the face of tariff risks.\n\u201cPeople feel pretty good because you haven\u2019t seen an effect of tariffs,\u201d Dimon said.  \u201cWhen I\u2019ve seen all these things adding up that are on the fringes of extreme \u2026 I don\u2019t think we can predict the outcome, and I think there is a chance of inflation going and stagflation a little bit higher than other people think.\u201d\nSeth Carpenter, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a Sunday note that he sees tariffs as an \u201coutsized, fundamental shock\u201d to the outlook for the US economy.\n\u201cRecent conversations suggest clients are feeling comforted that uncertainty is subsiding, but we hasten to add that tariffs remain and are likely to stay much higher than at the start of the year,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cAnnouncements late last week of sharply higher tariffs on Europe show that the risks of elevated tariffs are far from gone. Most importantly, the slowdown from tariffs that have already been imposed has yet to manifest in the hard data.\u201d\nAs uncertainty lingers about the US economy, retail investors could ask themselves whether they should keep dip-buying \u2014 and whether the best bets this year are even in US markets or elsewhere, like Europe.\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told CNN that diving in when stocks get relatively cheap has had a strong track record of success in recent years.\n\u201cBuying the dip as a strategy has worked exceedingly well for the better part of five years, and the more something works, the more people are inclined to keep doing it,\u201d Sosnick said.\n\u201cHow do you differentiate between buying a dip and catching a falling knife?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll do it until it doesn\u2019t work. And right now, it\u2019s working for them.\u201d\nDip-buying on Interactive Brokers, a trading platform widely used by retail investors, accelerated in April despite historic levels of volatility and uncertainty, Sosnick noted.\n\u201cA lot of our most active traders definitely embraced the volatility rather than fled from it,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody wants to miss a rally.\u201d\nSosnick said the top buys on Interactive Brokers have been AI and tech stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), as well as exchange-traded funds that track the tech-heavy Nasdaq. When it comes to buying stocks during a downturn, people tend to stick with names they know.\nUS stocks this year significantly lag European stocks, and some Wall Street investors see better options abroad than in America.\n\u201cIn many ways, the current muddle-through scenario \u2014 marked by wavering tariffs and shifting policy signals \u2014 might be the environment most likely to trigger a rotation in global equities,\u201d Alastair Pinder, a strategist at HSBC, said May 20 in anote. \u201cThe US no longer looksasexceptional, while other economies across the world are ramping up stimulus.\u201d\nThe S&P 500 is up slightly for the year after staging a recovery in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Europe\u2019s benchmark STOXX 600 index is up 9.4%.\nGermany this year passed historical fiscal reform toincrease its defense spending, boosting stocks in Europe. And while US markets have recovered sharply since April, many analysts are not convinced America is out of the woods yet.\nRelated articleTrump\u2019s trade war is pushing investors away from America\nRoss Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, said whether the US markets or Europe outperform this year will largely depend on the direction of the dollar.\nThe US dollar index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against six major foreign currencies, is down more than 8% this year. The euro in April hit its strongest level against the dollar in three years.\n\u201cInternational assets just have a tremendously easier time outperforming in a weaker dollar environment,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a bit of a bounce-back in the dollar, but there\u2019s part of me that still thinks there could be more downside to the dollar from here, which would be a boon to international.\u201d\nMayfield said the other key focus is whether investor excitement around AI continues to ramp back up or fades. If traders continue to rally around Big Tech companies that are \u201ctalking up their AI prospects,\u201d it could be difficult for Europe or other international markets to outperform the US market, he said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/28\/investing\/retail-investors-europe-us-stocks","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Taiwan\u2019s Taiex was closed for a holiday.\nRelated videoHear Trump break down tariffs on various countries\nWall Street had been nervous about Trump\u2019s tariffs, though some analysts expected stocks could rally if the tariff announcement was lighter than feared. Those hopes were quickly dashed as Trump unveiled baseline 10% tariffs on all imports, plus higher rates for specific countries.\n\u201cTrump is enacting a very aggressive tariff policy, far more aggressive than most investors thought possible six months ago,\u201d said Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital. \u201cPainful times for stock market investors.\u201d\n\u201cWhile the market was positioned to bounce on a \u2018less bad than expected\u2019 tariff announcement, there is no way to spin today\u2019s news as positive for the economy or stock market,\u201d said Ellerbroek.\nThe selloff turned into a rout Wednesday evening as investors reckoned with the extent of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nApple (AAPL) tumbled more than 7% in after-hours trading. The tech giant relies extensively on supply chains in China, which will be subject to steep tariffs.\nThe other stocks leading markets lower in after-hours trading included Tesla (TSLA), which fell more than 6% and Amazon (AMZN), which fell more than 5%.

{"title":"Tesla\u2019s best quarter of year isn\u2019t enough to impress investors. Because they know it won\u2019t last","date":"2025-10-22","body":"You\u2019d think after a tumultuous year for Elon Musk\u2019s car company, Wall Street would be cheering Tesla\u2019s record quarterly sales. They\u2019re not.\nThat\u2019s for two main reasons: First, Tesla\u2019s profit fell from a year ago and missed analysts\u2019 estimates.\nSecond, Tesla\u2019s sales were largely booming last quarter because customers scrambled to nab electric cars before a US tax credit expired.\nShares of Tesla (TSLA) fell 2% in after-market trading following the report, but ahead of a call for investors scheduled for 5:30 pm ET.\nTesla has a difficult road ahead, and investors know that. The ones still cheering and buying Tesla shares are those who aren\u2019t focused on car sales. Instead, they believe in Musk\u2019s promise of a future based on self-driving cars and robotics.\nIn fact, neither Musk nor CFO Vaibhav Taneja spent significant time talking about car sales or profits during an hour-long call with investors and analysts on Wednesday.\nInstead they spent most of the time talking about the promise of self-driving vehicles, robotaxis and humanoid robots, without much insight on when those thing will contribute to Tesla\u2019s bottom line.\nJudging by after-market stock trading, investors were not impressed. Shares were down a bit less than 2% as the call got underway but fell steadily during the first half, hitting a low of downabout 5%. While shares climbed back, they were still down more than 3% when the hour concluded.\nAs for the barely discussed financial results, the company earned adjusted income of $1.8 billion in the third quarter, down 29% from a year ago. That was a slightly bigger drop in earnings than analysts had forecast, and net income tumbled 37%.\nDespite the earnings miss, it was still the company\u2019s best quarter so far this year.\nThe drop in earnings came even after Tesla reportedrecord salesof nearly 500,000 cars during the quarter, as Americans rushed to buy electric cars before a $7,500 federal tax credit expired on October 1.\nBut electric vehicle sales in the US are widely expected to plunge in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s because people who would have normally bought EVs later in the year flocked to buy cars early to lock in the tax break. The loss of the tax credit is expected to hurt demand among American buyers going forward. Tesla gets nearly half of its revenue from US customers.\nTesla is also facing increased competition for EV sales globally, particularly from Chinese automakers. Those automakers not only dominate their own domestic market, but are also moving into Europe. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to overtake Tesla as the world\u2019s largest seller of EVs this year, despite the fact that it does not sell any cars in the United States.\nTesla sales worldwide fell 13% during the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier both due to increased competition, as well as backlash to Musk\u2019s political activity.\nBut the removal of the EV tax credit is only part of Tesla\u2019s problem. The Trump administration also eliminated what has been a key profit driver throughout the company\u2019s history \u2013 thesale of regulatory credits.\nIn years past, the federal government set emissions limits on the total greenhouse gases that came out of all the cars a company sold in a given year. If a car company sold too many gas-guzzling pickups, as opposed to economical hatchbacks or cars with no emissions at all, it would have to buy \u201ccredits\u201d from companies like Tesla.\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s massive tax and spending bill passed in July eliminated the federal penalties for violating emissions rules, and thus the need for automakers to buy regulatory credits.\nDespite the change in the law, the company still reported $417 million in regulatory credit sales in the third quarter. But that was $322 million less than a year ago, and the revenue loss caused a direct hit to the company\u2019s bottom line. CFO Taneja did say the company entered into new regulatory credit contracts in the quarter, but did not give any details on those contracts.\nRegulatory credit sales have brought in $11.4 billion for Tesla since 2019. Sometimes they werethe only thing keeping the company profitable at all \u2013 including in the first three months of this year.\nTesla launched the company\u2019s long-promisedrobotaxioffering with limited service in late June, with Musk promising much grander things to come.\nOn Wednesday, Musk said he thinks the robotaxi service would be operating in eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. But that\u2019s a long step back from the last earnings call in July,when he said the service would be available to half the US population by the year\u2019s end.\nMusk said Tesla is still set to start production of the Cybercab, a vehicle for the robotaxi service that does not have a steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, by the second quarter next year. \ufeffBut the service now requires has a human safety driver sitting in the driver\u2019s seat during each ride.\n\u201cSo so our goal is to be actually paranoid about deployment because obviously even one accident will be frontpage headline news worldwide,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s better for us to take a cautious approach here. But we do expect to have no safety drivers in the car in Austin\u2026 within a few months.\u201d\nIt also said production lines for the first generation of its planned Optimus humanoid robots are being installed in anticipation of volume production. But it did not give details of when production might begin.\nWednesday\u2019s call was also Musk\u2019s first time talking to investors since the company unveiled a new proposed pay package for the CEO, which could award him stock worth$1 trillion. Shareholders are set to vote on that pay package at Tesla\u2019s annual meeting next month. CFO Taneja took time at the end of the call to urge shareholders to support the pay package.\nMusk didn\u2019t get into much detail about the compensation package, characterizing it as necessary for him to be able to keep control of the company.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to go spend the money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, you know, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?\u201d\n\u201cI just think that there needs to be enough voting control to give us strong influence,\u201d he said near the end of the call, \u201cbut not so much that I can\u2019t be fired if I go insane.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and context.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/22\/business\/tesla-earnings","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Tesla shares are down about 26% over the past month.\nThe reasons for the Nasdaq\u2019s decline range from inflation risk to decelerating growth to its stocks having tough outlooks compared to other assets, said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, in an email.\n\u201cConcerns about potential economic growth deceleration may be fostering increased risk aversion, potentially leading investors to shift away from the more volatile Nasdaq index in favor of more stable investment options,\u201d said David Smith, a professor of economics at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School.\nNvidia posted strong quarterly earnings on Wednesday, though its stock\u2019s high valuation raises the question of how much more room there is to run.\nStill, the broader market remains near its all-time high, reached just last week. And the bumpiness in the market isn\u2019t all that unusual for this time of year.\n\u201cThe stock market\u2019s recent declines are simply garden variety volatility, largely because February is historically a volatile month, and because we saw significant gains throughout January,\u201d said Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management.\nWhile new inflation data matched expectations, other economic data released Friday revealed cracks in the economy that contributed to weary investor sentiment: Consumer spending pulled back far more than economists expected in January and posted the biggest monthly decline since February 2021.\n\u201cInvestors will continue to focus on the uncertain growth trajectory as real spending unexpectedly fell in January from weaker consumer demand,\u201d said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL financial, in a note.\nThe Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s estimates for economic growth in the first quarter of 2025 were also revised on Friday to project a decline of 1.5%, rather than growth of 2.3%.\n\u201cThis huge drop in the estimate reflects the very weak data that has been coming out on retail sales, net imports, inventories and new home sales,\u201d said Jay Hatfield, CEO and CIO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, in an email.\nChris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said he is cautious about the market due to high valuations.\nAt UBS, strategists advised preparing for volatility ahead, though considered the bull market intact.\n\u201cWe think the bull market is intact driven by healthy economic and profit growth, supportive Fed policy and AI spending\/adoption,\u201d said David Lefkowitz, head of US Equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Friday note.\n\u201cBut we have also cautioned that volatility would likely be higher this year due to policy uncertainty and trade frictions. Therefore, we have been highlighting that short-term hedges may be worth considering,\u201d said Lefkowitz.\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan and David Goldman contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/02\/28\/investing\/us-stocks-nasdaq","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

It marked the culmination of a remarkable recovery on Wall Street since the S&P 500 was flirting with bear market territory in early April.\nThe S&P 500 gained 0.5%, to close at a record 6,173.07. It marked the first new record high since February 19.\nMarkets almost didn\u2019t hit that record on Friday \u2014 they turned south in the late afternoon after President Donald Trump said the United States isending trade talkswith Canada because of a new digital services tax America\u2019s northern neighbor imposed on companies. Trump said a new tariff on Canada would be announced within a week.\nThat soured sentiment on Wall Street \u2014 but not enough to keep stocks lower. Stocks resumed their march higher one hour before the closing bell and rallied to finish the week.\nThe Nasdaq Composite also hit a record high Friday, gaining 0.5%. It marked the first all-time high since December 16. The Nasdaq has become synonymous with Big Tech, and the AI boom has fueled a tech rally in recent months. The smaller Nasdaq 100, made up of top tech stocks, set a record earlier this week.\nThe Dow rose 432 points, or 1%. It had been up as much as 580 points earlier in the day. The blue-chip index, dragged down by UnitedHealth, which has tumbled 39% this year, plus Apple, Merck and Nike, still has about 1,200 points, or 2.7%, left to gain before it hits its all-time high.\nThe Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq each posted their biggest weekly gain in six weeks.\nThe S&P 500 has been on a wild round trip: The index shed$9.8 trillion in market valuefrom its previous record on February 19 to its low point on April 8, before recovering all of those losses across the past two and a half months.\nOnApril 8, when stocks were on the verge of plunging into abear market, few Wall Street experts were predicting that the market would come close toa record highjust 80 days later.\nRelated articleTrump is ending trade talks with Canada\nIt\u2019s been an incredible journey over the past several months. Trump alarmed traders with historic tariffs that economists said could reignite inflation and plunge the economy into a recession.\nThe Trump administration then doubled down on those tariffs, culminating in the president\u2019s April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement. That sent tariffs for dozens of nations surging \u2014 some as high as 50%. US tariffs on China eventually eclipsed 145% for some products, effectively creating a blockade on America\u2019s second-biggest trading partner.\nOn April 9, heeding warnings from the stock, currency and especially the Treasury markets, the administration paused its \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs for 90 days, sending markets surging. Last month, the Trump administrationreached frameworks for trade deals with the United Kingdom and China, giving investors a sense that the most punishing trade policies were in the past, and more trade deals could be forthcoming.\n\u201cThe sell-offs should never have happened,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. \u201cThere was no need for that. It was a completely manufactured crisis.\u201d\nMarkets got another boost Friday afterChina signaledit would reopen its rare earth market to the United States. The news came just hours after White House officials said the two sides had reached a deal \u2014 a major breakthrough following weeks of negotiations.\nDespite a 10% universal tariff that remains in place, in addition to 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, and 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts, markets have largely looked past trade in recent weeks, focusing instead on other reasons for optimism or concern.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday said he believes trade negotiations with other countries could be\u201cwrapped up\u201dby Labor Day, providing a more relaxed framework for inking deals than the original July 9 deadline.\nBessent said in an interview on Fox Business that the United States has 18 \u201cimportant trading partners\u201d that it is seeking to make deals with. \u201cIf we can ink 10 or 12 of the important 18 \u2026 then I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labor Day,\u201d he said, without specifying the countries.\nA boom in AI, fueled by surging sales for Nvidia\u2019s chips and a Republican-led effort to deregulate the industry, has been one of the primary catalysts that have fueled stocks and helped investors move beyond the trade war. Hopes for a rate cut from the Federal Reserve, backed by reasonably strong economic numbers and low inflation, have also helped stocks in recent months.\nMarkets had temporarilygrown jitteryafter the House passed Trump\u2019s sweeping tax cut and domestic policy agenda last month. But demand for Treasury bonds has remained surprisingly strong, giving investors confidence that foreign countries and investors will continue to support America\u2019s debt, allowing the country to borrow unimpeded.\n\u201cInvestors get the joke now,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hear something, whether it\u2019s on Air Force One or on Truth Social, that we\u2019re going to have to take with a massive grain of salt.\u201d\nStocks face several challenges in the coming weeks and months.\nRelated articleA battery of new data shows how the US economy is holding up amid Trump\u2019s tariffs\nIf Congress reaches a stalemate in the domestic policy bill, which includes a provision to raise the debt ceiling, America could once again come close to defaulting on its debt because it is unable to borrow enough money to pay back its creditors. And if few (or no) more trade deals are forthcoming, tariffs could rise again as soon as July 9 as the 90-day reciprocal tariff pause expires.\nThe prospect of war breaking out in the Middle East remains a concern after a fragile truce between Israel and Iran was reached this week. And existing tariffs threaten to raise prices in the coming months, which could hurt economic growth.\nStocks face less existential threats, as well. Valuations are surging well above earnings expectations. The S&P 500\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio has surged past 23, a relatively high number that means stocks have become quite expensive compared to their profit expectations.\nMarkets were celebrating at the close today.

The market\u2019s rally also means stocks are relatively expensive \u2014 and more vulnerable to a surprise.\nStocks had a shaky start to September as investors entered a historically poor month for the market while concerns linger about President Donald Trump\u2019sfeudwith the Federal Reserve andlegal uncertaintyenveloping his tariff regime.\nThe Dow, S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq slid on Tuesday as investors grappled with the bevy of uncertainty. The Dow fell 249 points, or 0.55%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.69% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.82%.\nStocks are coming off an impressive run: The Dow and S&P 500 just recorded four consecutive months of gains. The S&P 500 has notched 20 record highs this year, and the blue-chip Dow in August hit its firstrecord highsince December.\nBut that rally didn\u2019t come without fresh caveats: according to some metrics, US stocks have literally never been this expensive \u2014 even during the dot-com boom. The S&P 500 on August 12 traded at 3.25 times sales, that metric\u2019s highest level ever, according to FactSet data. It\u2019s one signal that stocks might be overpriced, and more sensitive to a shift in sentiment.\n\u201cWe are trading at extremes,\u201d Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said. \u201cIf we\u2019re trading at all-time highs in that area, that is something to be concerned about.\u201d\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett\u2019sfavorite market indicator, which compares a measure of the total value of the US stock market to the value of US economic growth, is also flashing a warning sign. The Buffett Indicator is at 217%, a historically high level that signals the stock market might be strongly overvalued.\n\u201cOn the face of it, the US market is expensive,\u201d Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said. \u201cThere are no two ways about it.\u201d\nNot all metrics indicate record high valuations. The S&P 500\u2019s forward price to earnings ratio, a popular measure of valuation, is elevated but not at all-time highs.\n\u201cBy most widely used measures, US equities look highly valued relative to the rest of the world,\u201d James Reilly, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, said in an August 28 note. \u201cBut there is a difference betweenhighly valuedandovervalued.\u201d\n\u201cWhile it may appear that investors are paying a premium for US stocks, they may just be paying for superior long-run growth,\u201d Reilly said.\nMeanwhile, investors who buy the S&P 500 are increasingly betting on the success of a few, enormous companies.\nThe Magnificent Seven tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 as of last week accounted for 33.5% of the S&P 500\u2019s total market value, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nNvidia itself accounts forabout 8%of the S&P 500\u2019s market value. Tech\u2019s monster gains have helped fuel the market\u2019s rally. But as the market relies more on fewer companies and becomes more concentrated, it leaves investors less diversified and more exposed to a few companies\u2019 fates.\nEach of the Mag Seven stocks were lower on Tuesday. Nvidia fell roughly 2%, dragging the market lower.\n\u201cThere was a huge rally, so therefore expectations are, by definition, very high,\u201d said Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. \u201cIf you don\u2019t substantially beat expectations, you\u2019re going to roll over.\u201d\nIt was a strong summer for stocks. Now investors are looking ahead to the fall. Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, surged 15% on Tuesday as jitters crept back onto Wall Street.\nThe S&P 500 has declined in September in six of the past 10 years, according to UBS.\nMeanwhile, Treasury yields jumped higher on Tuesday, with the 30-year yield touching 4.98%, its highest level in over a month. After a quiet summer in the bond market, investors sold long-dated government bonds as concerns linger about debt burdens.\nA widespread risk-off sentiment put pressure on markets to start the month. Higher bond yields can also pull investors away from riskier assets like stocks, contributing to the potentially shaky ground this week for US stocks.\n\u201cThe market reaction to President Trump\u2019s effort to fire Fed governor Cook for cause based on allegations of mortgage misrepresentation to date has been very muted considering that it accelerates and intensifies the threat to Fed independence,\u201d Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, said in a note. \u201cWe think the market has not properly priced in the transition ahead.\u201d\nGold, a haven during uncertainty, hit arecord highTuesday. The yellow metal has soared roughly 35% this year as central banks have expanded reserves of bullion and investors have flocked tosafe haven investments. Gold prices can also rise when the Fed is expected to lower interest rates, and bullion has been boosted by increased Fed rate cut bets.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/02\/economy\/us-stock-market","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

It was a major rebound after markets had adismal first quarter.\nAfter tumbling in March and early April as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy shocked Wall Street, stocks then recovered their losses across May and June. At the halfway point into the year, the mood is remarkably different from three months ago.\nInvestors have cheered as stocks have swiftly recovered to fresh highs and volatility has subsided. Yet stocks are now relatively expensive and the economic backdrop remains uncertain, leaving questions about what catalyst might push markets higher.\n\u201cThe economic outlook for the second half of 2025 is highly sensitive to the path of government policy,\u201d said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, in an email.\nWall Street this week will focus on new monthly data on job growth in June, set to be released on Thursday. Markets will be closed on Friday for the Fourth of July holiday.\nAfter dropping 4.59% in the first quarter of the year, the S&P 500 gained 10.57% in the second quarter. The S&P 500 is up 24.5% since hitting its low point on April 8, defying expectations as it has climbed back from theprecipice of a bear market.\nSam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said the main factor contributing to the S&P 500\u2019s decline in the first quarter was \u201ca growing concern that the US would fall into recession as a result of the onerous tariffs placed on all major global trading partners.\u201d\nAs the worst of tariff fears have subsided, markets have staged a V-shaped recovery. That rebound has been led by the sectors that were hit the most in the first quarter, Stovall said.

{"title":"Trump says he\u2019s making America\u2019s economy great again. He\u2019s addressing the wrong problem","date":"2025-12-12","body":"For many people, the economy is a simple equation: paychecks minus expenses. When it feels like our incomes are growing faster than prices, the economy is in good shape. When they\u2019re not, it\u2019s lousy.\nPresident Donald Trump seems to be making analternative calculation.\nInstead of focusing on the cost of living or affordability, which Trump has repeatedly labeled a \u201choax,\u201d the president prefers to tout the revenue the US Treasury is collecting from tariffs and business investment. He talks frequently about the vast sums of money America is bringing in, comparing his \u201chottest ever\u201d economy favorably to the supposedly \u201cdead\u201d country under former President Joe Biden.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really taking in trillions of dollars if you think about it,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office Tuesday. \u201cThis is money pouring into our country on building car plants, on building AI plants. We just want to keep doing exactly what we\u2019re doing because nothing like this has ever happened in the history of the world.\u201d\nAlthough increased revenue and investment certainly benefit the US economy, Trump and the Republican party face abudding political crisisbecause ofaffordability, not economic growth. The economy has been chugging along just fine, actually \u2013 perhaps to the surprise of millions of Americans who give the economy poor marks because of thehigh cost of living.\nGrowing revenue and business can help address affordability. But connecting those dots is tricky, and Trump\u2019s \u201cactually, we\u2019re rich\u201d messaging does not appear to be winning over the hearts and minds of fed-up consumers.\nIn this \u201cwindchill economy,\u201d where Americans\u2019 financial situations feel worse offthan they really are, Trump is increasingly talking right past struggling Americans instead of speaking their language.\nTrump likes to repeat two basic refrains about his economic policy.\n\u201cLet me tell you about the real economy,\u201d Trump told Politico Tuesday in response to an affordability question. \u201cWe\u2019ve got $18 trillion coming into our country. Biden had less than $1 trillion in four years.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s math is hyperbolic, but tariff revenue is, in fact, up by more than $200 billion during Trump\u2019s term compared to Biden\u2019s. And dozens of companies and countries have pledged near- and long-term investments at Trump\u2019s encouragement, with promises counted in the trillions of dollars.\nTrump also announced a $1 million \u201cGold Card\u201d visa that launched this week, which he has said will bring billions of dollars into the country. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said the new visas will raiseup to $1 trillionfor the US Treasury.\nAnd Trump has spent billions of taxpayer dollars to invest government funds in businesses that his administration views as critical to national security. Because of stock market gains, Trump said those investments are already adding millions of dollars to the value of America\u2019s investments.\n\u201cThe price went through the roof,\u201d Trump said Tuesday about his administration\u2019s 10% stake in Intel (INTC). \u201cI made $40 million dollars. Nobody talks about that.\u201d\nThe Trump administration\u2019s theory is that actual and promised revenue increases could pay for the president\u2019s oft-proposed$2,000 stimulus checksand the expensive tax cut passed earlier this year. Trump has also claimed that tariff revenue can fully replace Americans\u2019 income tax burdens.\nEventually, the administration has said, tariffs can pay for America\u2019s massive debt itself.\nAmerica last year paid $1.2 trillion to finance its own debt \u2013 which,at about $38 trillion, exceeds America\u2019s overall economic output. Bringing in tax revenue to reduce the debt means we would need to pay less in interest and financing, which could, in turn, free up money for programs and benefits thatbhelp support affordability.\nFor example, Trump on Tuesday said tariff revenue paid for the $12 billion bailout his administration recently provided to farmers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken in so much money with the tariffs now that it\u2019s such a pleasure,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWithout it, we wouldn\u2019t be able to help you. We\u2019re the richest country in the world now.\u201d\nSeparately, Trump frequently talks about how the promised business investments could bring manufacturing and AI-related jobs to the United States. And tariffs could incentivize businesses to return overseas factories and outsourced workers to the United States.\n\u201cCar companies are moving back that left us years ago. AI is coming in at levels never seen before. Factories are opening up all over the country,\u201d Trump told Politico. \u201cUltimately, you know what it reduces itself to? Jobs. You\u2019re going to have jobs like you\u2019ve never seen in the United States.\u201d\nThe problems with Trump\u2019s theory are simple: The math doesn\u2019t add up, and any benefits those proposals would bring in the future won\u2019t help Americans who are struggling with the cost of living now.\nThe Trump administration brought in around $200 billion in new tariff revenue this year. That\u2019s not nothing, but in a $30 trillion economy, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket. It isn\u2019t enough to support $2,000 stimulus checks for every American household oreliminate income taxes. It certainly isn\u2019t enough to pay down the $38 trillion debt.\nThe investment pledges, though welcome, are just pledges, with no mechanism to enforce them. Companies are notorious for appearing at high-profile ribbon-cuttings with presidents only to eventually back out of plans \u2013 like Foxconn did shortly after it announced ahighly touted Wisconsin factorywith Trump during his first term. And much of the companies\u2019 accounting includesprevious commitments.\nEven if all of the pledges turned into real projects, factories are already struggling to hire qualified or willing workers. It\u2019s not clear new factories will meaningfully restore manufacturing work, which was lost in large part to automation over the past several decades.\nMeanwhile,tariffs are making affordability worse, not better. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said that Trump\u2019s tariffs are solely responsible for prices growing faster than the Fed\u2019s 2% long-term annual inflation target this year.\nThe core political messaging problem in this economy is rooted in the \u201cwindchill\u201d economy, whereeverything looks great on paper, but the lived experiences of millions of Americans who are struggling with their finances say otherwise.\nTrump can correctly and truthfully speak about strong overall economic growth and consumer spending \u2013 but it won\u2019t mean a thing to people if they feel like they can\u2019t live within their means.\nBut Trump is making his job extra hard by doubling down on the policies that won\u2019t make an immediate, meaningful difference for Americans\u2019 wallets, while dismissing the windchill factor as a \u201ccon job\u201d or a \u201cscam.\u201d\nTrump is speaking like a business executive, where revenue growth is the source of profit and stability. That\u2019s definitely important for America\u2019s economy, too. But the economy is not a business. The economy is people \u2013 and many of them are hurting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/12\/economy\/affordability-trump-economy-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"What to expect from stocks in 2025","date":"2025-01-01","body":"Stocks had a blockbuster 2023 and 2024. Will 2025 be athree-peat?\nAfter two years of substantial gains, Wall Street expects the good times for markets to keep going this year \u2014 just not on the massive scale investors have been spoiled with lately.\nWall Street forecasts reviewed by CNN show that most strategists expect double-digit percentage growth for the S&P 500 in 2025, though more moderate than in 2024. Analysts expect the S&P 500 to rise 14.8% in 2025, according toFactSet.\nUS stocks surged last year as strong economic growth, cooling inflation, a series of Federal Reserve rate cuts and enthusiasm for President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election victory boosted investor optimism. Tech and AI stocks were the stars of 2024, and they are largely expected to lead growth again in 2025.\nYet Wall Street analysts warn of potential downsides in 2025. Uncertainty around tariff policy proposed by Trump, potentially resurgent inflation and loominggeopolitical tensionsare among the issues that could hurt the stock market\u2019s growth, according toBank of America.\n\u201cI am bullish on stocks for 2025, though with valuations high and the bull market maturing, I don\u2019t think investors should expect quite such spectacular returns next year as we have seen this past year,\u201d Jurrien Timmer, director for global macro at Fidelity Investments said in aDecember 18 note.\nOf course, forecasting is a game only for the iron-stomached, and predictions can often miss the mark. In 2024, many analysts raised their price forecasts for the S&P 500 during the year, as the index surged higher than expected.\nThe S&P 500 ended 2024 with anannual gainof about 23% after rising by 24% in 2023, marking the first time since 1997 and 1998 that the index has closed with back-to-back gains of above 20%, according to FactSet data.\nThe thriving stock market has not just benefited traders: Gains in the S&P 500 boosts retirement savings and serves as a general signal of economic stability.\nBut Wall Street doubts another year of gains north of 20% is achievable. Forecasts from major banks, including UBS, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America for the S&P 500 in 2025 range from growth of around 10% to 14% \u2014 certainly healthy gains by any standard.\nAmong the more bullish analysts, Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo, expects the S&P 500 to reach 7,007 by the end of 2025 \u2014 a gain of about 19%.\nWall Street expects continued stock market gains because it forecasts strong economic growth, corporate earnings and an incoming business-friendly administration under Trump.\nHeading into 2025, some analysts see US stocks\u2019 impressive growth as evidence of a new era in tech and AI, with sustainable valuations and strong future earnings growth to support a continued rally.\nDan Ives, a tech bull and senior analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a December 30 note that he expects tech stocks to rise 25% in 2025 due to less regulation under the Trump administration and a continued \u201cGoldilocks foundation\u201d for Big Tech and Tesla.\nIves picked Nvidia, Microsoft and Palantir as his top three tech winners for AI in 2025. All were huge gainers last year, too.\nBut the ever-present potential for a volatile policymaking environment during the Trump presidency, the potential for a change in Fed policy and a market that has encountered precious little resistance could pose problems for stocks in 2025.\nThis year, the Fed largely quashed inflation without throwing the economy into a recession. Yet inflation is not entirely tamed. In December, the Fed issued what some economists termed a \u201chawkish cut,\u201d signaling that after the central bank cut rates it might not do so again for a while. After its final policy meeting of 2024, the Fed revised its outlook for its preferred inflation gauge for 2025, raising it from 2.1% to 2.5%.\nConcerns about inflation and the Fed sent stocks sinking in early December, and they\u2019ve been struggling to regain their momentum ever since. The Dow on December 18 set itslongest losing streaksince 1974.\nTraders expect just an 11% chance of a rate cut in January, according to theCME FedWatch tool.\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s admitted uncertainty as to monetary policy actions in 2025, combined with the expectation of only two cuts (rather than four) in 2025 amplified investor uncertainty and concern, triggering profit taking this year versus delaying into the new year,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\nAs the new year begins, investors will be glued to news about key issues \u2014 like potential tariffs \u2014 that could make or break markets under the Trump administration.\n\u201cThe most significant wild card on the table for 2025 will be the potential implementation of tariffs,\u201d David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar said in aDecember 3 note.\nAn extended selloff could undermine America\u2019s economic growth, notedMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, in apost on X. Zandi said he thinks the economy is \u201chighly vulnerable to a selloff in the stock market.\u201d He described how the stock market\u2019s growth has been driven by wealthy households opting to spend more and save less.\n\u201cIf the stock market falters, something I\u2019ve argued is a serious risk, these wealthy households would surely react by saving much more and spending less,\u201d Zandi said.\nCNN\u2019s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/01\/investing\/what-to-expect-from-stocks-in-2025","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

The Dow closed lower by 107 points, or 0.25%. The broader S&P 500 was flat, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.31%.\nThe S&P 500 had soared 2.1% across the past two days asinvestors welcomed a ceasefire, albeit fragile, between Israel and Iran. As the stock market has climbed back toward record highs, investors are wondering whether there is room for stocks to climb higher or if further roadblocks lie ahead.\nThe S&P 500 on Tuesday had closed just 0.85% away from an all-time high before closing flat on Wednesday.\n\u201cAs Middle East tensions de-escalate, the focus will return to more fundamental concerns for investors such as tariffs, earnings, the federal deficit and President Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d said Chris Brigati, chief investment officer at SWBC, in a Tuesday note.\nDespite plenty of headwinds, including the possibility of reignited inflation from higher tariffs this summer, some Wall Street analysts believe stocks still have room to rise.\n\u201cWe are not looking for a massive rally from current levels, but believe that the path of least resistance is a grind higher,\u201d said Mohit Kumar, an economist and strategist at Jefferies, in a Wednesday note.\nThe US stock market has been on a wild ride this year. After tumbling into correction in March and flirting with a bear market in April, the index recouped its losses in May and June and is up more than 3.5% year-to-date.\nThe S&P 500 had entered the year hittingrecord high after record high. The index hit its last record high on February 19 as Wall Street rallied at the start of Trump\u2019s second term.\nThe index began to tumble in March and April as the president unveiled his tariff policy, and it\u2019s been trying to claw its way back toward a new record high since.\nAfter Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on April 2, the S&P 500 closed at its lowest level this year on April 8, down 18.9% from its February record high. At its low, the S&P 500 had shed $9.8 trillion in market value since its record high, according to FactSet data.\nThe S&P 500 rallied sharply in April after Trump walked back his massive \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs. The index then gained 6.15% across May as the rebound rally accelerated, posting itsbest monthly gain since November 2023and its best performance in May since 1990. The benchmark index is up 3% so far in June, recovering trillions of dollars in market value since April.\nAlthough the Trump administration has only announced atrade deal with the United Kingdomand atruce in its trade war with China, many investors have been betting that the worst of the tariff confusion is in the past.\nAs the market has recovered, momentum around US tech and artificial intelligence has begun to pick up pace. The Nasdaq 100 on Tuesday closed at an all-time high, notching its first new record high since February.

That would lead to slower economic growth, higher inflation and higher interest rates for longer, according to Slok \u2014 all major obstacles to the S&P 500 climbing higher.\nGeopolitics and second quarter earnings releases beginning in mid-July are other catalysts that could impact investor sentiment and the market, said Eric Freedman, CIO at US Bank Asset Management, said in a Monday note.\n\u201cHow companies are absorbing or passing on tariff price increases represents a key item of investor interest in upcoming quarterly releases, with investors gauging the future impact on inflation, interest rates and economic growth,\u201d Freedman said.\nKumar at Jefferies said in a Wednesday note that he is looking for how US jobs data holds up this summer and whether Treasury yields rise due to concerns about the deficit, which could pull investors away from stocks.\n\u201cThe main message for investors is to stay invested and avoid reacting sharply to any news or market reaction that may have a short-term negative impact upon equity prices,\u201d SWBC\u2019s Brigati said. \u201cIt is nearly impossible to attempt to time the market, therefore maintaining a disciplined and long-term investing approach serves investors well.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/25\/investing\/stock-market-record-dow","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

{"title":"How Trump built \u2014 and is now losing \u2014 his golden economic touch","date":"2025-11-14","body":"It was some feat for Donald Trump, a billionaire with his own airliner who lived in an eponymous skyscraper in liberal New York and wintered in a Florida palace, to brand himself as the conservative champion of working Americans.\nBut his political alchemy on the economy is dissolving.\nTrump\u2019s presidency is taking a wobble as he flaunts his sun king\u2019s life of luxury and obsesses over building, literally, his personal legacy with vanity projects like aWhite House ballroomover his campaign vow to make America affordable again.\nTrump is coming across as increasingly oblivious to awave of economic insecuritysweeping the nation, which is hitting many of the voters he won over in two presidential election victories as he transformed the GOP from its starchy country-club roots to ablue-collarelection machine.\nIt might be agolden ageforWhite House decor, but the new era of prosperity that he promised in 2024 is still elusive.\nA slew of recent polling showsdeep pessimismamong Americans about the current state of the economy and its prospects. But Trump doesn\u2019t want to know.  \u201cThe economy is my thing. And we have the greatest economy in history,\u201d he told Fox News this week. He seemed irritated to be confronted with questions about high costs for food and housing.\nThis retreat into a gilded bubble couldn\u2019t come at a worse political moment. Hisapproval ratingsare tanking. TheEpstein scandalis back to haunt him. And the Beltway political and media world has suddenly discovered the new buzz issue of \u201caffordability\u201d after Democrats won gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey with populist economic promises.\nAs he seeks to stave off lame-duck status, Trump desperately needs to rediscover his common economic touch. If he fails, the midterm elections next year could be grim for Republicans.\nTrump\u2019s initial electoral edge on the economy was a shrewd mix of branding, a political sixth sense about resentment boiling in hollowed-out industrial heartlands in 2015 and his own mystique as a consummate dealmaker.\nCritics in recent days have lampooned his perceived lack of empathy for citizens who are struggling economically. But he was never a Bill Clinton-style \u201cfeel your pain\u201d politician. Trump instead amplified the voice of voters who believed they\u2019d paid the price for the globalization and free trade policies that made the establishment elite rich. He might have been wealthy \u2014but he was never in the club. Like his base, he knew what it felt like to be left out: He\u2019d been spurned by high society for decades, deemed vulgar and nouveau riche.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon,\u201d Trump said in his searing first inaugural address in 2017. \u201cOne by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s political magic was also cultural. His dystopian tirades on immigration and crime were popular. His vulgarity helped him pose as an outsider. And the Democratic Party\u2019s turn to aspirational upper middle-class voters and apparent disdain for those immortalized in Hillary Clinton\u2019s disastrous \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d comment helped sever it from the working class. Trump\u2019s birtherism campaign against Barack Obama was a way to exploit backlash to the first Black presidency. And a leftward move by Democrats on social issues drove more voters into his camp.\nTrump also had something else \u2014 a mythology of success. His spell on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d evoked the image of a self-made business titan. If he made himself rich, why not everyone else? Trump rally-goers often cited this as a reason to vote for him, even if Trump\u2019s history of business scrapes and near-bankruptcies told a more questionable story about his effectiveness as a tycoon.\nIn the 2024 campaign, Trump rode the advantage of fond memories of the pre-pandemic economy in his first term. It was also easy to lambaste the Biden administration\u2019s months of denial on inflation and the failure of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to spell out her own convincing appeal to the middle class.  Trump posed in an apron andworked the fry stationat a McDonald\u2019s in Pennsylvania, boosting his common-man credentials.\nIt would not be true to say that Trump has done nothing to tackle costs felt by working Americans. His entire economic policy, including tariff hikes on almost every country in the world, is designed to revive the glory days of the 20th-century factory economy. \u201cIf you think about your hometown in the state that you grew up, Main Street looks a lot different today than it did many years ago. And President Trump wants to restore America as a manufacturing superpower around the globe,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in March.\nThe White House claims the massive tax cuts in Trump\u2019s \u201cone big beautiful bill\u201d put more money in the pockets of most Americans, even ifthe wealthiest did best. It says its program of gutting regulations and canceling wasteful spending will do the same. Next year, a new portal known asTrumpRxwill seek to lower drug prices. Last week, the president announced a deal with two pharma giants to lower the price of obesity drugs. The administration claims tariffs raised trillions of dollars. The stock market has been on a tear.\nEvidence is mounting that Trump\u2019s policies are making the affordability crisis worse. His tariffs are raising the price of goods for Americans. He\u2019s had to promise a massive bailout to farmers hammered by his trade war policies. His new brainwave is for$2,000 paymentsto Americans pulled from government coffers swelled by tariffs. This sounds like a nice idea. But it could backfire by spiking inflation \u2014 and it is hardly a long-term answer for millions of Americans juggling bills and cutting back on the basics, who are now also confronting fears that AI will take their jobs.\nThe administration implicitly acknowledged its policies are making things harder for working Americans when Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week pledged swift tariff relief on some staples like coffee and fruit. \u201cCoffee, we\u2019re going to lower some tariffs. We\u2019re going to have some coffee come in. We\u2019re going to take care of all this stuff very quickly, very easily. It\u2019s surgical. It\u2019s beautiful to watch,\u201d Trump said on Fox.\nBut he was partly to blame for the spiking price of a cup of joe, having slappeda 50% tariffon major producer Brazil because it prosecuted his friend former President Jair Bolsonaro for election interference. If ever there was a case of a president\u2019s fixations making life worse for his people, this was it.\nWhen all else fails, there\u2019s always denial. Trump suggested on Fox that polls highlighting anxiety over the economy were fake. Andon \u201c60 Minutes\u201d this monthhe said, \u201cWe have no inflation\u201d and, \u201cOur groceries are down.\u201d\nThe inflation rate is 3.0%, far lower than its peaks during the Biden administration. But in the political argument it\u2019s often forgotten that prices aren\u2019t going down; the rate at which they are increasing has simply slowed. It\u2019s an equation every shopper understands, even if the president doesn\u2019t.\nThe gap between peoples\u2019 experiences of the economy and his sunny diagnosis of the country\u2019s performance is highlighting how Trump, a politician who performs best when he has an enemy to attack, lacks a vocabulary for empathy. He\u2019s a salesman, a booster, or as his critics would say, a con man who thrives on hyperbole.\nTrump is not alone among presidents in struggling to articulate a positive economic message in tough times. In a 1992 campaign debate, President George H.W. Bush was caught looking at his watch while Clinton connected on voters\u2019 economic struggles, creating an instant metaphor of indifference. During the 2012 campaign, Obama\u2019s advisers struggled to find the balance between celebrating the rebound from the Great Recession without appearing oblivious to the unresolved struggles of many voters who weren\u2019t feeling it.\nTrump\u2019s behavior in the government shutdown made his case harder \u2014 for instance, when he asked the Supreme Court tostop food stamp paymentsto more than 40 million Americans, handing Democrats an easy political weapon. And his indifference to rising health insurance premiums doesn\u2019t help much either.\nTrump\u2019s advisers know he has a problem. They are considering whether he should tour the country togive economy-focused speeches. This follows calls from some Republicans, like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for him to drill down on \u201cAmerica First\u201d economic policies after months spent trying to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\u201cThe president gets it. He knows this is an issue,\u201d a senior White House official told CNN\u2019s Alayna Treene. \u201cBut he\u2019s frustrated he\u2019s not getting credit for what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\nScheduling Trump for a scripted speech might sound like a good idea. But it could backfire, like the infamous time in the 2024 campaign when he went to North Carolina to engineer an economic pivot and a wild campaign rally broke out. \u201cThey wanted to do a speech on the economy so we are doing this as an intellectual speech. You are all intellectuals today,\u201d he told his crowd, mocking his own campaign strategy.\nA better option must just be to hold rallies. They might at least restore his political mojo and renew his connection with his voters. Rallies have played an important role for Trump. He used them almost like vast focus groups, testing out lines scanning the crowd to test reactions. He has no such equivalent source of political intelligence in the White House, surrounded by obsequious aides, conservative media and his Cabinet of millionaires and billionaires. Trump does mingle on the patio of his Mar-a-Lago club. But hefty membership fees mean it\u2019s hardly a haunt of working Americans.\nPresidents often get too much credit when the economy roars and too little when it sours. But any prolonged downturn in the coming months could doom Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. And Democratic candidates showed the way for their colleagues in Virginia and New Jersey with blue-collar economic themes and by toning down progressive cultural rhetoric.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/14\/politics\/trump-affordability-rebate-checks-snap-economy-analysis","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

But right now, the 34-year-old is barely getting by.\nAustin is living paycheck to paycheck and saving almost no money, one of the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet in an increasingly unaffordable economy.\nWorse, the family-owned construction business he works at is shutting down.\n\u201cI am going to be unemployed in the next month or two \u2013 with no safety net,\u201d said Austin, who declined to share his last name.\nAn estimated 24% of US households are living paycheck to paycheck so far in 2025, according to a Bank of America Institute analysis released this week. The bank\u2019s researchers combed through internal data on its tens of millions of consumers and tracked how much income customers spent on necessities like housing, gasoline, groceries, child care and utilities.\nThey found that 24% of households spend over 95% of their income on those necessities, leaving little to nothing left over for the \u201cnice-to-have\u201d things like going out to dinner or taking a vacation, let alone saving.\nAustin, who has a master\u2019s degree in fine arts, said he\u2019s applied to roughly 1,000 jobs over the past year \u2013 everything from teaching to construction \u2013 with no luck.\n\u201cTo be 34 and living paycheck to paycheck with no savings, things are pretty crappy right now,\u201d he said.\nAustin is supporting his partner, a veterinary student, and worries about how the two of them will pay off his student debt on top of all their other expenses.\n\u201cWe want to own a house and start a family, but I don\u2019t know how we will ever get our feet under ourselves,\u201d he said.\nThe Bank of America report is evidence of the K-shaped economy, where affluent Americans are faring far better than those at the bottom.\nMany are struggling to get by, even as President Donald Trumpdismisses affordability concernsas a \u201ccon job\u201d conjured up by Democrats based on \u201cfake\u201d polls.\nBut the rate of increase in households living paycheck to paycheck has slowed significantly this year, and while there is little change this year for middle- and high-income households, the share of lower-income households living paycheck to paycheck has jumped from 27% in 2023 to 29%, according to Bank of America.\n\u201cHigher income and lower income households are living in two different worlds,\u201d Joe Wadford, economist at the Bank of America Institute, told CNN.\nThe problem is that paychecks among lower-income households are often not keeping up with prices \u2013 especially now thatinflation has reaccelerated.\nAfter-tax wages increased about 2% in October year over year among middle-income consumers, Bank of America found. That\u2019s below the 3% inflation rate as of September.\nWage growth for lower-income Americans is falling even further behind. Their after-tax wages increased just 1% year-over-year.\nBy contrast, high-income wages jumped 4%, safely outpacing the increase in the cost of living.\nWadford said the wage growth gap between high- and low-income Americans hasn\u2019t been this high since 2016.\nFor Millennials like Austin, that gap is even bigger.\nWages have inched up just 1% for low-income Millennials, compared with 6% for high-income.\n\u201cWe work full-time and have degrees. And we\u2019re getting nowhere,\u201d Austin said.\nGregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, said the large number of households living paycheck to paycheck underscores the \u201cdeepening affordability crisis\u201d caused by five years of price hikes that have outpaced income gains.\nFor the broader economy, the risk is that many families struggling to get by and worried about their jobs opt to spend much more cautiously.\n\u201cThis could weaken the foundation of a consumer-driven economy,\u201d Daco said.\nThat\u2019s especially true if layoffs gather steam in what had been a no-fire, no-hire job market.\nGoldman Sachs economists warned in a recent research report of a growing \u201crisk of labor market deterioration.\u201d The Wall Street bank estimates there is a 20% to 25% chance that the US unemployment rate jumps by at least 0.5 percentage points in the next six months. That\u2019s up from just a 10% chance as of six months ago.\nSome Americans are falling behind on their bills \u2013 especially those with low credit scores.\nThe percentage of subprime borrowers who are at least60 days late on their car loansclimbed to 6.65% in October, according to Fitch Ratings.\nThat is the highest since Fitch tracking began in the early 1990s, surpassing the prior peak set in January and well above levels during the Great Financial Crisis.\nThis trend is a clear sign of financial distress, especially since car loans are historically the last payment Americans are willing to miss.\nBank of America has found that the number of households making just the minimum payment on their credit card is also rising, though so is the share of credit card users paying off their entire balance each month.\n\u201cThere is a mixed bag. There are some signs of consumer health, and yet, within the minority of people experiencing financial stress, pressure is mounting,\u201d said Wadford, the Bank of America economist.\nVanessa Jones, a 65-year-old grandmother living in Davenport, Iowa, took on a second nursing job two years ago because she couldn\u2019t make ends meet.\n\u201cThe cost of living is way too high. My savings have been depleted. I haven\u2019t tapped into my retirement, but that looks like the next step,\u201d she said.\nJones, the primary caregiver for her two grandchildren, was recently diagnosed with cancer and wound up with \u201castronomical\u201d medical bills. Facing $85,000 in medical debt, she filed for bankruptcy.\nJones pushed back on politicians arguing there is no affordability crisis.\n\u201cThe people claiming prices are lower are not actually buying their own groceries or trying to find the cheapest place to get their car fixed,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to walk in our shoes.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/13\/economy\/job-prices-debt-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Walmart just proved it\u2019s America\u2019s solution to the affordability crisis","date":"2025-11-20","body":"Walmart is proving to be America\u2019s antidote to the cost of living crisis.\nA growing number of Americans are heading to Walmart for groceries and clothing as inflation and high prices squeeze their budgets: Walmart\u2019s business in the United States is surging and it\u2019s gaining market share from rivals, the company said Thursday in its quarterly financial report.\nWalmart has used its massive size and scale to drive down prices and pour billions of dollars into investments such as raising wages, sprucing up stores and building a logistics network for online shopping.\nThese investments are paying off for Walmart at a moment when many Americans\u2019 finances are stretched.\nLast quarter, Walmart\u2019s US sales increased 4.5%. Walmart saw an uptick in customer trips to stores, and shoppers spent more when they visited. Walmart also raised its sales and profit guidance, signaling it expects a strong holiday shopping season.\nWalmart\u2019s gains have been led by middle-class and upper-income households turning to its stores and website to try to save money.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gaining market share, improving delivery speed, and managing inventory well,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a news release. \u201cWe\u2019re well positioned for a strong finish to the year and beyond that.\u201d\nMcMillon announced Friday that he\u2019sretiringsoon as CEO after 11 years.

{"title":"The global AI race is supercharging Taiwan\u2019s economy. But many don\u2019t feel better off","date":"2025-11-28","body":"For proof that an economy can thrive even under constant military threats from a powerful neighbor and amid US President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs, look no further than Taiwan.\nThe self-ruled democracy has logged roughly 8% economic growth for two consecutive quarters, a rare achievement for a developed economy and one that is projected to push its 2025 GDP growth close to 7.4%, even surpassing China\u2019s.\n\u201cTaiwan\u2019s economy has clearly been one of the best performing economies in the world, particularly over recent quarters,\u201d said Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics. \u201cMany people expected Taiwan\u2019s economy to benefit from the sort of AI boom, but maybe many underestimated to what extent it would do.\u201d\nTaiwan\u2019s statistics bureau on Friday reported8.21%year-on-year growth in GDPin the third quarter, driven by a 36.5% surge in exports in the period ending September. This followed an already striking 7.7% expansion in the second quarter.\nIn October, exports hit a record high, climbing 49.7% from a year earlier \u2013 the largest single month increase in over 15 years.\nTo top it all off, Taiwan\u2019s stock market overtook Germany\u2019s in September as the world\u2019s eighth largest, riding on the global frenzy for artificial intelligence.\nBut even as Taiwan\u2019s economy flourishes, driven by the outsized influence of its high-tech sector as exemplified by the world-beating chipmaker TSMC, many citizens have been unable to share in the boom, as income gaps widen and wages remain stagnant.\nEconomists say a key reason is that the gains are highly concentrated. Electronics manufacturing accounts for more than 15% of GDP but employs just 6.5% of the workforce, according to Capital Economics.\nThis unevenness is partly reflected in sluggish consumer spending. Consumer confidence has remained subdued throughout the year, according to theindex released by the Research Center of Taiwan Economic Development. Trump\u2019s trade war has also dampened sentiment, economists say, particularly as Taiwan has yet to finalize a trade agreement with Washington.\n\u201cFrom my perspective as a salaried worker earning above the median income, I feel the economy isn\u2019t actually doing that well,\u201d said Vivian Chen, a nurse in the Southern port city of Kaohsiung.\nChen\u2019s observations are echoed by many in the home of the global chip powerhouse. Taiwan\u2019s GDP per capita is forecast to exceed $38,000 this year, outpacing South Korea and Japan. But its average wage lags both countries by at least 30%, according to CNN\u2019s calculations of official data.\nTaiwan\u2019s tech prowess, built over decades in the chip and electronics industries, has positioned the island to benefit from the AI boom. As tech giants from Google and OpenAI to Microsoft rush to build data centers powered by graphics processing units designed by Nvidia and AMD, Taiwanese companies have been at the forefront, manufacturing the semiconductors and servers essential for training AI models.\nIn one prominent example, TSMC, the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker that supplies Nvidia and is known by locals as the \u201cprotector of the nation,\u201d has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range, driven by the explosive growth in AI, after surpassing sales expectations in previous quarters.\nMeanwhile, Taiwan\u2019s outbound shipments to the US, where most of the AI data center expansions have occurred, have grown more than 63% in the first 10 months of this year, according to Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Finance.\nBut questions have mounted about the sustainability of this export-driven boom, especially amid concerns that the AI frenzy could cool.\nTaiwan\u2019s export growth \u201cwill definitely come down next year,\u201d said Wang Jiann-Chyuan, vice president of the semi-official thinktank Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research. He expects growth to retreat from about 30% in recent quarters to single digits, as this year\u2019s surge makes further expansion harder.\nAdding to the uncertainty is Trump, Wang said. Taiwan\u2019s trade surplus with the US hit a record this year, raising the risk of scrutiny from a president who has made reducing trade deficits a central goal of his tariff campaign.\nSo far, chips and electronics, which made up more than 73% of Taiwan\u2019s exports, have been spared from the levy. While Trump has repeatedly threatened triple-digit tariffs on semiconductors, he has exempted companies, including TSMC, that build manufacturing facilities in the United States.\nStill, the heavy concentration of exports in the high-tech sector has amplified concerns about over-reliance on a single industry \u2014 or even a single company. While chips and electronics now account for nearly three-quarters of exports, up from roughly half five years ago, traditional sectors such as metals, machinery, and plastics have seen little growth or outright decline.\nFor Wu Jieh-min, a researcher at Taiwan\u2019s top research institute Academia Sinica, however, part of the concern about the island\u2019s economic future are associated with many Taiwanese people\u2019s deep-seated insecurity about its political status. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to absorb it by force, if necessary.\n\u201cI think the cautious, on-edge mindset you see across Taiwanese society is very obvious, and I actually see it as something positive,\u201d said Wu, whose research focuses on political economy and sociology.\n\u201cWe have to manage our own future very carefully, because even just surviving is already difficult for us,\u201d he said.\nOn the ground, some Taiwanese say the rosy headline figures don\u2019t reflect their daily lives, like Chen, the nurse, who said salaries for health professionals feel stagnant.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you hear doctors complaining about being underpaid, and why so many nurses are leaving the country or the industry altogether,\u201d Chen said.\n\u201cPeople in Taiwan keep hyping themselves up, saying things like \u2018We have TSMC,\u2019 or boasting about how high the stock market is. But for many living here, their monthly pay stayed much the same,\u201d she added.\nGT Lin, an AI engineer in Taipei, echoed that sentiment.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the country is strong, but the people aren\u2019t necessarily wealthy,\u201d he said.\nTaiwan\u2019s real wage growth, adjusted for inflation, began to slow in the late 1990s and has remained stagnant since the early 2000s. Labor\u2019s share of GDP peaked at about 50% in the 1990s and has since fallen to around 44%.\nRoy Ngerng, a Singaporean labor activist based in Taipei who has written extensively about the issue of wage stagnation in Taiwan, attributed the problem to long-term wage suppression \u2014 aimed at boosting export competitiveness.\nHe said that while Taiwan\u2019s economy has seen exceptional growth in recent years \u2013 and booming profits among tech businesses \u2013 average workers and employees in other sectors have been mostly left out, widening the income disparity.\nJust five years ago, wages in the electronics sector were already 35% above the economy-wide average, according to Capital Economics. Now they are more than 70% higher.\nNgerng added that the current government has been steadily increasing the minimum wage.\nWu Tsong-Min, an economist at National Taiwan University, however, notes that wage stagnation is \u201cnot unique to Taiwan,\u201d as many advanced economies face similar issues, particularly among low-skill workers.\nWu, the author of \u201cA 400-Year History of Taiwan\u2019s Economy,\u201d also pointed out that Taiwan\u2019s GDP per capita, after adjusted for purchasing power, rises further thanks to lower domestic prices.\nStill, housing remains a major burden: Taipei\u2019s house price-to-income ratio has nearly tripled in the past two decades, surpassing London, New York and even Hong Kong, according to theGlobal Property Guide.\nFor Wu of Academia Sinica, he remains \u201ccautiously optimistic,\u201d saying that the thriving tech industry could generate spillover effects that trickle down to other sectors, even though the effects remain to be seen.\n\u201cTaiwan\u2019s economy wasn\u2019t shaped by deliberate planning or an exceptionally capable government, but rather an evolutionary process,\u201d he said.\nWhile the size of Taiwan\u2019s economy is dwarfed by leading global powers, Wu added, its small and medium-sized enterprises are nimble, adaptable and attuned to global trends.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how its semiconductor industry became what it is today.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/28\/economy\/taiwan-ai-economy-intl-hnk","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Wait, I thought the economy was terrible. What happened?","date":"2025-11-20","body":"Entering this week, the perception of America\u2019s economy was overwhelmingly negative.\nBut after what, at least on the surface, appeared to be astronger-than-expected jobs reportand killer earnings fromNvidiaandWalmart\u2013 all within the span of about 18 hours \u2013 is it possible the economy is better than anyone thought?\nIt\u2019s complicated. Let\u2019s break it down.\nAmerica\u2019s labor market started to stall out in the early summer. Between May and August, job gains averaged 31,000 per month, or about one-fifth the monthly rate seen last year. What happened in September \u2013 the report we just got after a seven-week delay \u2013 is a bit convoluted.\nThe preliminary job gains of 119,000 were more than double the 50,000 net increase economists were expecting. However, unemployment moved higher and the prior months\u2019 employment picture turned murkier: The original payroll numbers for July (79,000) and August (22,000) were revised down to a gain of 72,000 and a loss of 4,000, respectively.\nAll told, the September job growth is a welcome sign that the labor market wasn\u2019t collapsing heading into the shutdown, but the underlying trends haven\u2019t changed much: It\u2019s still a low-hire, low-fire slog with job growth limited to a handful of industries, leaving few opportunities for those who want jobs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody should be cheering about what we saw in the September jobs report,\u201d Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, told CNN in an interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s a relief that it wasn\u2019t worse and that it was (119,000) jobs added; but also remember, almost every number lately has been revised down.\u201d\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said he remains concerned about the health of the job market \u2013 just as concerned as he was prior to Thursday\u2019s report.\n\u201cThe economy is struggling to create jobs. The unemployment rate is low but it\u2019s now showing some stress,\u201d Zandi said, adding that the closer the rate gets to 5%, the greater the risk of a \u201creinforcing negative cycle\u201d that can cause a recession.\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have been under siege after the government shutdown, benefits cuts and Democratic election sweep earlier this month exposed what many Americans have been experiencing for years: the cost of living is too high, and consumers are increasingly fed up.\nA poll published byFox Newsthis week showed 76% of Americans have a negative view of this economy, up from 67% in July. Only 15% of respondents said Trump\u2019s policies are helping their financial situation, and 46% said they are hurting \u2013 a gap similar to polling at the end of former President Joe Biden\u2019s term, right before voters booted Democrats from the White House.\nPeople are making real changes to their spending habits:Home DepotandTargetposted worse-than-expected earnings earlier this week and slashed their forecasts, saying that consumers are making fewer visits and spending less when they shop.\nChipotle, Coca-Cola, Crocs and a host of other consumer brands have made similar comments: American households that bring in less than $100,000 are struggling with already high prices and still-stubborn inflation, and they are pulling back on spending. But people who earn more are more insulated, benefiting from a surging stock market and rising home values.\nThat so-calledK-shaped economyexplains some of the nuance in the overall state of the US economy \u2013 and why Walmart blew past Wall Street\u2019s already-robust forecasts. Walmart said its fastest-growing segment of customers was made up of people earning more than $100,000 \u2013 those who were willing to spend money but were searching for value.\n\u201cPeople\u2019s financial situations are getting squeezed,\u201d Long said. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to find work. And for people who have jobs, their income is not rising much faster than inflation. It\u2019s this treading water feeling for the middle class right now, and that\u2019s the part I don\u2019t see changing.\u201d\nThe stock market is decidedlynotalways representative of the broader economy, but its strength or weakness can influence how people perceive it. When fears of an AI bubble dragged down the stock market over the past several weeks, that weakness may have contributed to increasingly negative sentiment about the economy.\nIt started late last month when Palantir, a company that uses AI for government contract work, reported a weaker-than-expected forecast. AI stocks, which have propped up the broader market for several years, started to sink.\nBut that ended \u2013 at least for now \u2013 afterNvidia\u2019s earningslate Wednesday proved that demand for its industry-leading AI chips hadn\u2019t evaporated. In fact, demand has continued to surge. The company\u2019s earnings beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations, sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the broader market roaring back to life Thursday.\nWall Street basically has no idea. After the Dow gained 700 points earlier Thursday, it gave up all those gains and fell more than 200 points by midday. Even economists are confused.\n\u201cThis morning\u2019s employment report is adding more confusion than clarity to an exceedingly foggy backdrop,\u201d said Mike Reid, RBC\u2019s senior US economist.\nThat could complicate matters for the Federal Reserve. It may look at Thursday\u2019s jobs data and earnings with a glass-half-full view and determine that the economy doesn\u2019t need an interest-rate cut in December. That appeared to be the direction the Fed was heading anyway, afterOctober policy meeting minutesreleased on Wednesday showed deep skepticism about a December rate cut. But that could in turn could keep consumer loans like mortgages and auto loans high, too.\nAlternatively, the Fed may look at the rising unemployment rate, overall hiring slowdown in the summer and weakness across multiple sectors and determine the economy needs some more juice. But that could exacerbate some of America\u2019s inflation concerns.\nSimilarly, your personal financial situation influences how you view this economy. If you have a high-paying job in a field that\u2019s relatively insulated from layoffs, you may be feeling great and spending a lot now. If you don\u2019t\u2026 you probably aren\u2019t.\nIncreasingly, people in the latter category arereallystruggling \u2013 going into serious debt and struggling to find work. That\u2019s why the Trump administration is increasingly floating new policies like lowering housing costs,sending stimulus checksto American households and cutting tariffs. They\u2019re controversial, and economists are split if they\u2019d work, but they\u2019re responsive to a growing wave of negativity.\nIt\u2019s not clear how this all will shake out. The economy has had false alarms over the past several years. But what\u2019s clear is many Americans hate this economy, and they\u2019ll continue to hate it until they feel like they can afford things again.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/20\/economy\/economy-jobs-earnings-ai","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"White House weighs stepped up domestic travel and speeches to improve Trump\u2019s standing on the economy","date":"2025-11-12","body":"President Donald Trump\u2019sadvisers have had conversations about him traveling the country to give economy-focused speeches as they privately weigh a number of strategies to improve his standing on the issue, administration officials told CNN.\nTrump\u2019s advisers acknowledge that they have an affordability problem that the president hasbristled at in public: Americans\u2019 outlook on the economy is dour, and the administration\u2019s efforts to ease their financial anxieties aren\u2019t resonating.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t convince people that their experience, what they\u2019re feeling at home, isn\u2019t reality,\u201d one of the officials said.\nWhite House officials have advised the president not to brush away or outright dismiss that Americans are feeling squeezed byrising prices, they said. They have been actively putting \u201cpolicy time\u201d \u2014 as one of the officials characterized it \u2014 on Trump\u2019s schedule with the goal of accelerating the administration\u2019s efforts to tackle inflation.\nWhile Trump has talked extensively about affordability in recent days, he has often downplayed the strain Americans are feeling, suggesting in a Fox News interview on Monday that polls capturing Americans\u2019 economic anxiety are \u201cfake.\u201d\nOne of the strategies being discussed in the West Wing is for Trump to turn much of his attention to his domestic agenda. That includes ramping up his domestic travel, the officials said, and pulling back on his international trips. As the holidays draw near, there\u2019s also a push to coordinate new messaging on what the administration is doing to help lower costs.\nTwo key factors last week \u2014 Democratic victories in Tuesday\u2019s elections and the mounting pain of the record-long government shutdown \u2014 initially set off alarm bells, not only in the White House but in the Oval Office directly, about the magnitude of the issue, the officials said.\nThe discussions also come as Trump has been criticized, including by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of focusing more on his foreign policy and less on domestic concerns, though the president dismissed that notion on Monday.\n\u201cI have to view the presidency as a worldwide situation, not locally,\u201d Trump said, responding to the criticism thathe was too busy meeting with foreign leaders. \u201cBut with all of that, I passed a great big beautiful bill, which is the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.\u201d\nThe president, meanwhile, has been personally frustrated with Americans\u2019 perception of his administration\u2019s handling of the economy and the media\u2019s coverage of it.\n\u201cThe president gets it. He knows this is an issue,\u201d a senior White House official said. \u201cBut he\u2019s frustrated he\u2019s not getting credit for what he\u2019s doing,\u201d pointing to energy deregulations and the extension of his 2017 tax cuts.\nTrumpacknowledgedthat frustration last week, just hours after Democrats walked away with major wins in New Jersey, Virginia, New York City and California.\n\u201cI tell Republicans, you want to win elections, you got to talk about these facts,\u201d he told a financial conference in Miami, concluding that his party has been too quiet about the economic accomplishments of his term so far. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s really easy to win elections when you talk about the facts.\u201d\nEarlier in the day, Trump castigated Senate Republicans, arguing they weregetting \u201ckilled\u201d politicallyby the government shutdown, which public polling showed Americans blaming more on the GOP and Trump than on Democrats.\nIt appears the shutdown could be over by week\u2019s end, but officials argue that it has contributed to burgeoning concerns about the cost of living in the US. (The shutdown also exposed anotherpotential political liabilityfor the GOP in the form of rising health care premiums, which the party will be forced to grapple with after this week\u2019s votes to reopen the government.)\nTrump\u2019s public comments on the economy have at times been reminiscent of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, who was widely seen as out of touch for initially downplaying the threat of inflation.\nPressed during Monday\u2019s Fox News interview about why Americans say they\u2019re down on the economy if he\u2019s accomplished as much as he says he has to lower prices, Trump questioned the premise.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have the greatest economy we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d He used the opportunity to point to the revenue being generated from his tariff policies. (In aCNN pollreleased last week, 61% of Americans said Trump\u2019s policies have \u201cworsened economic conditions in this country.\u201d That number topped out at 58% under Biden in CNN polling.)\nFact check: Trump\u2019s lying spree about inflation\nSome of the president\u2019s defensive messaging has come from what he\u2019s being told by his advisers, who have argued that his financial policies are working but need time to settle in, two of the officials said. They\u2019ve also cautioned that while his tariffs have caused a temporary ripple in the economy, those hurdles will be smoothed out by the 2026 midterms.\n\u201cPresident Trump inherited the worst affordability crisis in modern American history, and in less than ten months, he stopped inflation in its tracks,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement. \u201cThe President\u2019s pro-growth policies of deregulation and energy independence are bringing down gas prices, food prices, and inflation \u2014 and Americans will continue to benefit. Trust in Trump \u2014 he created the greatest economy in his first term and he is doing it again in his second term.\u201d\nYet despite Trump\u2019s grandiose claims about ushering in the best economy in history and knocking Democrats\u2019 affordability message as a \u201ccon job,\u201d he\u2019s also taken steps in recent days to try to make his mark on the issue. He\u2019s floated$2,000 tariff rebate checksto lower- and middle-income Americans, gone after meatpacking companies he\u2019s accused of jacking up prices, and even raised the idea of a 50-year mortgage (a proposal that stemmed from Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte and one that many White House officials are not on board with).\nAll of those moves appear to be an indication of how the president is seeing the affordability issue resonate, even as he attempts to brush it off in another breath.\nAnd while some in the White House see the new fixation on affordability as an overreaction to last week\u2019s elections and shutdown anxiety, administration officials also want to avoid Biden\u2019s mistakes, which means taking Americans\u2019 perceptions about the economy seriously \u2014 and doing something about it.\nWith critical midterms that will shape the rest of Trump\u2019s term now less than a year away, they don\u2019t see time to waste.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/12\/politics\/trump-economy-white-house-strategy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"America\u2019s job market is turning into an exclusive airport lounge","date":"2025-12-09","body":"In aK-shaped economywhere the \u201chave-nots\u201d areincreasingly falling behind the \u201chaves\ufeff,\u201d the labor market is trending toward a similar fate.\nJob opportunities didn\u2019t shrink as feared in October as holiday staffing needs lifted openings to a five-month high, new shutdown-delayed data showed Tuesday. However, the latest official look atemployment trendsshowed that there\u2019s still a deep chill running down the spine of the US economy.\nHiring continued to stall, layoff activity picked up, and employees clung to their jobs with white knuckles: The voluntary quits rate (a closely watched indicator of worker confidence) fell to a five-year low, according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\u201cThe labor market is becoming a much more exclusive club,\u201d said Noah Yosif, chief economist at the American Staffing Association, told CNN in an interview Tuesday. \u201cThose on the inside, they\u2019re doing pretty well; but for those on the outside, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to break in.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if that is to continue in the long term, the inability for those folks on the outside to hold down a steady paycheck could cause more severe ramifications for the economy,\u201d he added.\nWhat is the k-shaped economy?\nTuesday\u2019s report, which includes September and October JOLTS data, is the latest in a long pipeline of federal economic reports that were delayed and disrupted by the historic federal shutdown\u2019s negative effect on statistical agencies\u2019 abilities to collect, process, analyze and disseminate crucial data.\nIt\u2019s the first labor market release for October from the BLS and the most up-to-date official look at the job market for Federal Reserve policymakers, who are currently meeting to consider their next move on rates. (A policy announcement is due at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday.)\nThe BLS\u2019JOLTS reportis a closely watched indicator of labor turnover, providing the trajectory of how much businesses say they\u2019re looking to hire (openings); how much they\u2019re actually adding to their workforce (hires); to what extent they\u2019re cutting back on their workforce (layoffs); and to what extent people are voluntarily leaving their jobs (quits).\nThat churn is needed for a healthy labor market (and healthy economy).\n\u201cThe labor market depends on dynamism,\u201d Yosif said. \u201cThe dynamism of the labor market is really what determines whether not only employers are able to find the best candidates for their work, but also what determines whether employees are able to find the best opportunities for them and, of course, earn a steady paycheck to contribute to the economy.\u201d\nHowever, for much of this year, the US labor market has lost its momentum. And despite the elevated tally of estimated job openings seen Tuesday, that trend held true in September and October.\nWhen theAugust JOLTS report was releasedon the eve of what would become the longest-ever shutdown, job openings as a share of total employment remained at a five-year low.\nThere was a solid rebound in September, Tuesday\u2019s data showed, as the number of available jobs picked up from 7.23 million in August to 7.66 million. In October, they ticked higher to 7.67 million.\nHowever, the elevated level of openings appeared to be largely driven by businesses gearing up for the holiday shopping season: Trade industries (wholesale, retail and transportation) saw the biggest jumps in job postings in October, JOLTS data showed.\nThe hiring outlook was even more dour: Very few industries added jobs. Aside from a bump among some services firms, hiring was flat if not down across most sectors.\nA first look at November hiring shows the private sector lost 32,000 jobs\n\u201cWhere employers really put their money where their mouth is, is when it comes to hiring,\u201d Yosif said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, we haven\u2019t really seen much of an uptick in hiring.\u201d\nThe estimated level of hires as well as the rate of hiring (as a percentage of total employment) picked up in September from August; however, they both dropped off again in October. The hires rate returned to one of its lowest points seen in more than a decade, BLS data shows.\nTo anyone on theoutside looking in, that\u2019s unwelcome news.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no holiday cheer for job seekers,\u201d Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote Tuesday. \u201cWhile it\u2019s encouraging job openings ticked up in October, it\u2019s hard to get too excited until firms start hiring people.\u201d\nLayoffs increased in September as well as October, landing at the highest level since January 2023. However, the rate of layoffs is about where it was heading into the pandemic.\nIn thislow-hire, low-fire labor marketenvironment where it\u2019s taking jobseekers an average of six months to find work, those who have employment are holding on to what they have, Tuesday\u2019s report showed.\nQuits fell to their lowest levels since May 2020, when the pandemic rocked the economy.\nFor now, the US economy can withstand the dwindling momentum in the jobs market, Yosif said, noting a shift in the \u201cbreakeven rate\u201d of employment. Put simply, the economy doesn\u2019t need to create as many jobs as it once did to sustain itself.\n\u201cBack in 2023, the breakeven rate for the economy was about 250,000 jobs every month, but now that\u2019s dropped to about [30,000] to 40,000 jobs per month,\u201d he said, noting that the year-to-date job gains well outpace that breakeven point.\nHowever, he cautioned, the bigger question starts to become, \u201cWho is having access to these opportunities.\u201d\n\u201cThe stagnant labor market is really having a disproportionate impact on the young and financially vulnerable workers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy can definitely withstand this lack of momentum for a good amount of time, but it\u2019s the people who are really getting crushed by the stagnant labor market whose effects are going to be felt more acutely.\u201d\nA clearer snapshot of employment activity will be available the morning of December 16 when the BLS releases the November jobs report. The shutdown-delayed release also will include partial data for October (payroll estimatesbut not survey-drawn datasuch as the unemployment rate or demographic data).","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/09\/economy\/us-jolts-job-openings-october-september","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The affordability crisis is forcing Trump to radically reshape his economic plan on the fly","date":"2025-11-14","body":"President Donald Trump swept into office with a bold plan toremake America\u2019s economy. But the realities of a persistentaffordability crisis, low favorability ratings and biting election losses for his Republican party are forcing him to remake his plan on the fly.\nAlthough still in the early stages, Trump\u2019s Plan B appears to be a spaghetti-on-the-wall strategy that includes $2,000 tariff rebate checks, 50-year and portable mortgages and lower tariffs on common grocery items.\nEach tactic comes with significant question marks \u2013 and some are so radical economists fear they could squeeze Americans\u2019 finances even more.\nThe original Trump economic plan was based onthree bold assumptions:\nFor the plan to come to fruition, all three parts had to work perfectly. That\u2019s because each part relied on the other. If one leg of the stool was loose, the whole thing would topple over.\nAs it turns out, some parts didn\u2019t work.\nBoosted by deregulation of AI companies and tax cuts, the stock market has roared higher. But consumer prices haven\u2019t fallen \u2013 they\u2019ve continued to rise. Inflation remains relatively low, but it is picking up, in part because of tariffs.\nHigh-profile corporate promises to invest in US manufacturing could take years to bear fruit. Meanwhile, the tax cuts and deregulation have failed to persuade American businesses to make the level of investment that the Trump administration had hoped for. Overall hiring in the United States has come to a standstill in recent months.\nBond yields have fallen but not enough to make a major difference. Mortgage rates remain above 6%, and the number of subprime borrowers defaulting on their auto loans hasdoubled over the past four years, according to Fitch Ratings.\nIt may be early to judge Trump\u2019s economic plan less than a year into his second term, but Americans are increasingly fed up. A recentCNN poll conducted by SSRSshowed that 72% of Americans say the economy is in poor shape, and 61% say Trump\u2019s policies are making the economy worse. A Democratic sweep of this month\u2019s elections showed a significant leftward shift in former Trump voters and proved affordability was front and center in voters\u2019 minds when they went the polls.\nNow, a new plan is emerging.\nTariff dividends:Trump last weekend floated the idea of$2,000 tariff rebate checks, a proposal he\u2019s mused about before but which seemed to initially catch his advisers off guard this time. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, doubled and tripled down on the proposal this week, saying a plan was actively being considered.\nUsing tariff revenue to issue a kind of stimulus check would need congressional approval, and that may be a tough sell when inflation is on the rise again. Economists warn that sending households thousands of dollars could trigger a rush of demand for goods without adding supply to the market. That imbalance could raise prices even more,exacerbating inflation.\n50-year mortgages:Trump this week acknowledged that his administration is considering a50-year mortgage, which could lower homebuyers\u2019 monthly premiums by drastically extending the length of their home loans. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal \u201ca complete game changer.\u201d\nBut critics argue that a 50-year mortgage will ensure many borrowersnever actually own their homes. Money that some borrowers could have saved for retirement would end up paid to banks in the form of higher interest payments. The length of the loan also means the total interest ultimately paid on a loan would jump.\nAll of that could harm Americans\u2019 long-term financial security.\nPortable mortgages:Pulte this week said the Trump administration was considering aportable mortgage, which would allow borrowers to maintain their existing, lower-rate home loans when they purchase a new home. That could potentially thaw the frozen US housing market by giving homeowners the assurance that they could keep their relatively low mortgage payments when they move \u2013 even as current mortgage rates remain high.\nBut industry experts worry that the logistics of a portable mortgage plan could be difficult to overcome. The plan would require borrowers to cover the cost difference between the new home and the old one, which could mean a second mortgage. And it could throw a wrench in the gears of the investment market that keeps the mortgage market flowing, unintentionally raising mortgage rates along the way.\nLowering some tariffs:Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week said that the administration will announcelower tariffs on producethat isn\u2019t grown in the United States, including bananas and coffee. \u201cThat will bring the prices down very quickly,\u201d Bessent said.\nThat could reduce import prices, but it probably won\u2019t have a dramatic effect on consumer prices. So far, businesses have chosen to pay roughly 80% of the tariffs\u2019 cost, according to a recent JPMorgan analysis. And the produce Bessent mentioned may be particularly bad examples: Coffee prices were surging because of climate change, long before tariffs kicked in, and Americans\u2019 fixation on coffee ensures that companies can keep their prices high. Bananas are particularly low-priced fruit that won\u2019t dramatically relieve grocery price pressures.\nA significant amount of political capital remains at stake: Trump won reelection on the economy, criticizing former President Joe Biden for failing to address the rising cost of living after the post-pandemic inflation crisis. Trump\u2019s promise to cut prices on Day One was always unrealistic, but his signature economic policy, tariffs, has proven unpopular, as Americans associate the tariffs with higher costs.\nInstead, the administration\u2019s policies may be exacerbating the so-calledK-shaped economy, in which wealthier Americans benefit from their growing investments in the stock market while lower-income Americans increasinglylive paycheck to paycheck.\nTrump\u2019s immediate reaction to the GOP\u2019s election losses and new polls was denialism: Heclaimed, falsely, that prices have, in fact fallen during his administration.\nBut the administration is beginning to shift its focus and acknowledge Americans want the White House to do more to address their high cost of living. Administration officials told CNN\u2019s Alayna Treenethat Trump is getting more frequent economic briefingsand has been encouraged to spend more time on domestic travel and policies.\nAnd Bessent this week coined a new Trump-approved phrase: \u201cMake America Affordable Again.\u201d The devil, as always, will be in the details.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/14\/business\/cost-of-living-affordability-plan-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The government is back open. Here\u2019s what that means for economic data","date":"2025-11-14","body":"The US government has reopened following its longest-ever shutdown, setting the stage for the eventual release of the gold-standard federal data that is crucial in analyzing the health and trajectory of the nation\u2019s economy.\nData nerds(and government officials,and Federal Reserve policymakers, and business owners, and, well,everyone else for that matter),rejoice!\nStarting next week, the backlog of federal data will start flowing, and the long-awaited September jobs report (originally due out October 3) will publish Thursday, November 20, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Friday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like flying in fog without any instrumentation,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\nHowever, expect some choppiness when the air starts to clear.\nThe very nature of the 43-day shutdown has created an unprecedented situation: Some datapoints were not gathered when they typically should have been, increasing the potential for big holes in what\u2019s expected to be already messy data.\nSince the government was dark for the entirety of October and the first dozen days of November, several reports that included data collected in September and scheduled to be released in the ensuing weeks were not delivered (with the exception of the Consumer Price Index), nor was data collected for October (we\u2019ll get to that here shortly).\nOther major reports in the wings \u2013 likely in various stages of completion \u2013 include September data on wholesale inflation, import and export prices, quarterly employment costs, annual consumer expenditures, retail sales, gross domestic product and consumer spending.\nThat remains to be seen.\nThe leading statistical agencies are in the process of updating their schedules for economic releases (a calendar set in place more than a year ago).\nHowever, it\u2019s not as simple as plugging reports into different dates. Several releases are reliant on data from other series. For example, CPI and Producer Price Index data points feed in to the Fed\u2019s favored inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index,which in turn feeds in to GDP.\nOn Friday morning, the Bureau of Economic Analysis \u2013 the statistical arm of the Commerce Department that estimates GDP and produces data on topics such as income, spending, foreign trade, and state and local economies \u2013 announced it is \u201cworking to update its schedule of economic releases\u201d and is consulting with the Census Bureau, BLS and other suppliers of data used to produce the BEA\u2019s indicators.\nEarly Friday afternoon, the Census Bureau announced revised release dates for three reports originally slated to publish in early October. The August data on construction spending, manufacturers\u2019 shipments and international trade will be released Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week, respectively.\nEach economic data series will be affected differently by the shutdown, depending on how, when and from whom the data is collected, said Erica Groshen, a former BLS Commissioner who serves as senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\nStill, she noted, expect the BLS and other agencies to prioritizePrincipal Federal Economic Indicators, which are about three dozen major statistical series used to describe the condition of the US economy. (The jobs report, CPI, PPI, and PCE are among these. The Job Openings and Labor TurnoverSurvey, for example, is not).\nAs it stands now, October 2025 could very well amount to a \u201clost\u201d month of data \u2013 or close to it.\nDuring the shutdown, the nation\u2019s statistical agencies were run by skeleton crews as the actions of collecting, analyzing and disseminating data were suspended \u2013 disrupting finely tuned processes that have underpinned major economic reports for decades.\nFor example, the jobs report is composed by two surveys: one of businesses and one of households. The establishment survey is primarily automated and relies upon online portals for businesses to submit their information such as workforce levels and pay. The household survey, on the other hand, is largely conducted via telephone and in-person visits.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to ask people what their situation was five weeks ago, and it\u2019s bound to be unreliable,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. \u201cI think part of the employment report for the month of October will be lost forever, and we will only get the data that is submitted by companies.\u201d\nThe household survey is what\u2019s used to generate labor force estimates and the unemployment rate,and since that wasn\u2019t conducted in October, \u201cwe\u2019re going to get half the employment report,\u201d National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassettsaid on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the jobs part, but we won\u2019t get the unemployment rate.\u201d\nThe lack of a complete monthly employment snapshot isn\u2019t ideal when the US labor market entered the shutdown on seemingly shaky ground; however, a rough picture of the trajectory could still be assembledusing the payroll estimates combined with a smattering of private hiring data as well as state-level unemployment filings and layoff notices, wrote Mike Reid, senior US economist at RBC in a note Thursday.\nThevisibility on inflationdata for October will be \u201cparticularly bad,\u201d Reid noted.\nTwo-thirds of the pricing data that feeds in to the CPI is collected by in-person visits to brick-and-mortar stores, Reid said. Wholesale-level prices also were not collected in October for the Producer Price Index.\nThat will then ripple through to the PCE price index, where about 90% is constructed from CPI and PPI inputs, he added.\n\u201cUnlike the labor market, there are few (if any) reliable alternatives to the CPI report,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsent the CPI and PPI reports, it\u2019s hard to gauge inflation\u2019s trajectory.\u201d\nAnd if the October inflation data is released, it could pose a \u201cserious data quality issue,\u201d as it would likely lean more heavily onimputation, a methodology that utilizes a variety of existing datapoints to capture missing information.\n\u201cBut we know that already when the statistical agencies have all the data available, there\u2019s a big degree of uncertainty, and sometimes the numbers are not statistically significant,\u201d EY-Parthenon\u2019s Daco told CNN. \u201cSo, with even less data, the statistical significance of these numbers is likely to drop even further.\u201d\nThe shutdown lasted through nearly half of November, meaning that this month\u2019s data also will not emerge unscathed, economists said. However, they also fully expect all major reports to be released.\nThere\u2019s a greater likelihood that inflation data will have a higher level of imputations, noted RBC\u2019s Reid. The timing and staffing levels of returning BLS employees also could impact the collection of data, including the household survey for the jobs report, said former BLS Commissioner Groshen.\n\u201cBLS has fewer resources this time, because it is down 20% in its staffing, one-third of its leadership positions are vacant, and it\u2019s possible they had even more people quit during the course of the shutdown,\u201d she said, referencing the Trump administration\u2019s large-scale layoff of federal workers earlier this year via the Department of Government Efficiency.\nStill, while it\u2019s possible that the surveying of households in November could include questions for October, it\u2019s unlikely, she said, noting current staffing levels and the heft of the data backlog facing statistical agencies.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very highly orchestrated way that those interviews are conducted, so just even running surveys simultaneously is problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not be surprised if the Census Bureau and BLS just decided that they can\u2019t run the October [household survey] again.\u201d\nIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s possible that the BLS could estimate the October unemployment rate from the September and November data, she said.\n\u201cNoisy\u201d reports aren\u2019t out of the ordinary for major economic releases such as the jobs report. Large disruptions, including those considered relatively short term, have a way of leaving their mark on data for months (or, in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, for years).\nEntering into evidence are the October 2024 and November 2024 jobs reports.\nIn October 2024, a month impacted by two major deadly hurricanes and massive labor strikes, the initial employment snapshot showed a net gain ofjust 12,000 jobs\u2013 a far cry from September\u2019s 223,000-job gain.\nIt was also a one-time blip.\nAfter striking workers and weather-waylaid employees went back to work in November, the jobs report for that month showeda surge of 227,000 jobs gained.\nWhen the October 2025 jobs report is released, it\u2019s expected to show significant job losses \u2013 perhaps to the tune of 1.5 million jobs, RBC\u2019s Reid estimates \u2013 largely because of federal workers who were not on payrolls.\nAnd, with the shutdown ending during the week that includes the 12th of the month \u2013 the period the BLS uses to tabulate employment \u2013 the November jobs report should capture the return of those employees and contractors to payrolls.\nStill, the shutdown gummed up the nation\u2019s statistical machinery, and it could take a couple of weeks for everything to get sorted out and running smoothly again.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll likely be the February period, where we get the January data, before we get our first real clean look at the US macroeconomic data,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a price to be paid there in terms of the quantity and quality of the data that we\u2019re going to get until early winter 2026.\u201d\nThe privately produced data provided a sense of what the federal data could show; however, if those expectations are dashed, there is potential for wide swings in the markets, said Zandi, of Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\u201cIf they hit the mark, and that\u2019s what they show, then no harm, no foul,\u201d he said. \u201cIf, though, the numbers come out and vary from what we expect \u2013 either on the upside on the downside \u2013 then that may call into question the Fed policy that\u2019s been done since the shutdown.\u201d\nUS stocks hadtheir worst day in a monthThursday and were lower Friday as traders digested news that the government had reopened. Investors braced for weeks\u2019 worth of data set to be released in short order.\n\u201cI say this only half-jokingly: Maybe because the government is opening up again, the market took a dive,\u201d economist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research told CNN\u2019s Matt Egan. \u201cWhen the government was shut down we could believe whatever we wanted to believe. Now we need to be data dependent and that may not be as much fun.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/14\/economy\/federal-data-what-to-expect-economic-data","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nIt\u2019s the circle of political life: Now, as in 1992 when Bill Clinton was trying to unseat George H.W. Bush, what ails the electorate can be boiled down to a soundbite: It is, in fact, the economy, stupid.\nDemocrats trounced Republicans on Tuesday in three key races with little in common apart from one issue \u2014 affordability. It\u2019s the same problem that propelled President Donald Trump to a second term. And the same problem that Trump, who promised lower prices on \u201cDay One,\u201d has let fester as he carries outan economic agendaof tariffs, tax cuts and deportations that are, unavoidably, inflationary.\nElections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City reflected an electorate that is financially exhausted after five years of inflation that peaked in 2022. Although prices have stopped rising rapidly, they have not come down, contrary to Trump\u2019srepeated liethat prices \u201care down\u201d and that there is \u201cno inflation.\u201d\nIdeologically and culturally, Tuesday\u2019s mayoral and gubernatorial races couldn\u2019t be more different, but across those closely watched races, voters called economic issues \u2013 taxes, cost of living or the economy as a whole \u2013 their top concern,CNN exit polling found. Only voters in Virginia saw their state\u2019s economy as excellent or good, while those in California, New York City and New Jersey took a more pessimistic view.\nAt the same time, Republicans and independents didn\u2019t get any help from the president\u2019s decision tobulldoze the East Wingto build a $300 million ballroom,refurbish the Lincoln bathroomwith marble and gold, or host a\u201cGreat Gatsby\u201d-themed partyat his private Florida club last weekend whilerefusing to fully fundvital food-assistance benefits during the shutdown.\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming obvious that Trump cannot relate to the voters \u2013 and vice versa,\u201d Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments, told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cPeople can see with their own eyes what is going on with prices.\u201d\nValliere said there is a sense that Trump is \u201coblivious to the anxiety that so many Americans are feeling.\u201d\nLast shutdown, Trump hunkered down at the White House \u2018all alone.\u2019 This time, Mar-a-Lago beckons\nThose optics gave Democrats, particularly the moderate gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia, room to run on the economy while largely steering clear of Trump-bashing.\nMoody\u2019s Analytics found the typical US household is spending $208 more per month now than it was in September 2024 to buy the same goods and services because prices have snowballed. And when measured against early 2021 prices, families must spend $1,043 more per month to buy the same stuff.\n\u201cI heard again and again \u2014 \u2018it\u2019s just too expensive,\u2019 so I focused on those key issues,\u201d New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill told CNN\u2019s John Berman on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m going to quickly move to address those key issues, but at the same time, forcefully push back against these economic hits that we\u2019re seeing coming from Washington.\u201d\nEnergy is also re-emerging as a hot-button issue for voters.\nTrump promised last summer toswiftly cut electricity prices in halfif voters returned him to the White House. Instead, electricity prices are rising unusually fast.\nWhile gas is cheaper than a year ago, US residential electricity was 6% more expensive in August year-over-year, according to the mostrecent federal data. That\u2019s twice the pace of overall inflation.\nVoters in Virginia are getting hit with even bigger price hikes, with residential electricity prices there surging 13% between August 2024 and August 2025.\nA major part of the problem comes from big Trump backers in Big Tech. Long-stable demand for power is suddenly rising fast as Big Tech scrambles to build massive data centers to support the artificial intelligence boom. And Virginia is ground zero for the buildout of those power-hungry data centers.\nTakeaways from Tuesday\u2019s elections: Democrats win across the spectrum as voters reject Trump\nIn New Jersey, which has among the highest power bills in the US, electricity prices have spiked 21% \u2014 a fact that pushed many voters toward Sherrill, who vowed to declare a state of emergency on energy prices. According to exit polls, most New Jersey voters who call the economy or health care the top issue in the state backed Sherrill, while voters who are more focused on taxes or immigration supported her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli.\nEconomic turmoil stemming from Washington, DC \u2014 including DOGE layoffs and the longest-ever government shutdown \u2014 became a central concern for the hundreds of thousands offederal employees who live in Virginia.\nThat insecurity compounded voters\u2019 economic anxieties, helping Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger win with her message of \u201cpragmatism over partisanship,\u201d as she referred to it in her victory speech Tuesday night. \u201cYou all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian.\u201d\nIn New York, meanwhile, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani clinched his victory with an unrelenting focus on making one of the most notoriously expensive cities in the world more affordable for the working class, particularly when it comes to housing.\nIn his victory speech, Mamdani reiterated his promise to tackle the cost-of-living crisis by freezing rent for more than 2 million residents, make city buses free and fund universal child care by raising taxes for millionaires and corporations.\nTrump denies inflation is hurting Americans. It\u2019s the same mistake that haunted Biden\nExit pollingshowed that message discipline paid off: Mamdani voters overwhelmingly called cost of living the top issue facing the city, with 7 in 10 saying the cost of housing where they live is a major problem, compared to just about a third who say crime is a major problem.\nNow comes the hard part, as Mamdani himself stated on Wednesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to diagnose the crisis in working-class Americans\u2019 lives,\u201d hesaidat a news conference. \u201cYou have to deliver on addressing that crisis.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/06\/business\/democrats-trump-economy-affordability-nightcap","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The US economy added 42,000 private-sector jobs last month, more than expected","date":"2025-11-05","body":"Private-sector job creation bounced back in October, according to a snapshot of the labor market that has become more closely watched in theabsence of official federal jobs data.\nPayroll processing company ADP on Wednesday estimated that private-sector businesses added an estimated 42,000 jobs last month, a swing into positive territory after back-to-back months of job losses.\nWhile October marked a return to job growth, ADP\u2019s chief economist cautioned that the pace of hiring is running far slower than earlier this year and far more concentrated in a few sectors.\n\u201cThat recovery is tepid, and it is not broad-based,\u201d Nela Richardson, ADP\u2019s chief economist, said during a call with reporters on Wednesday.\nThe largest job gains were spread across industries such as trade, transportation and utilities (+47,000 jobs); education and health services (+26,000); and financial activities (+11,000), ADP reported.\nThose posting the biggest job losses were information (17,000 jobs lost), professional and business services (15,000 jobs lost), and leisure and hospitality (6,000 jobs lost).\n\u201cThe most concerning trend would be that drop in leisure and hospitality, because that points swiftly back to the consumer and how healthy and resilient the consumer will be,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIn the last three months of the year, we\u2019ve seen consumer resiliency push up employment in that sector, so this negative number is something to watch as we go into the holiday season.\u201d\nRichardson also flagged that hiring softness among small businesses could be another concerning sign as to the health of the economy, noting smaller companies\u2019 outsized share of employment.\nADP\u2019s monthly tally has shown a significant slowdown in the job market since the summer, with net losses for September and August. Following revisions released Wednesday, there weren\u2019t as many jobs shed in September as ADP initially estimated. September\u2019s losses now sit at 29,000 jobs (versus a 32,000-job loss) and 3,000 positions were shed in August.\nStill, a bounce-back was expected for October. Last week, ADP launched a weekly \u201cpulse\u201d report of employment estimates. That report showed that private employers added an average of 14,250 jobs per week during the four weeks that ended October 11.\nWednesday\u2019s job gains came in stronger than the 37,500 jobs added that economists expected, according to FactSet.\nThe pulse report was launched to \u201cmeet the moment,\u201d Richardson said, noting the federal government shutdown\u2019s resulting black hole of employment and other data.\nWhile ADP\u2019s estimates have always functioned as a proxy for the official monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2013 which is typically released two days afterwards \u2013 the two sets of numbers don\u2019t always track.\nHowever, with no jobs report last month nor expected this month due to the shutdown, ADP\u2019s data has taken on an outsized role for economists and investors looking to gauge the health of the economy.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the lack of government data is \u201cclouding\u201d the central bank\u2019s view of economic activity and that a decision on a rate cut next month is not a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re driving in the fog, you slow down,\u201d Powell said at a press conference following the October rate-setting committee meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do our jobs one way or the other. I hope by the time of the December meeting, we\u2019re getting a better flow of data.\u201d\nThe Fed implemented a quarter-point rate cut last week in order to shore up a softening labor market, but Fed Governor Lisa Cook this week said she sees more urgency for the central bank tofocus on stubborn inflationrather than on unemployment.\nThe latest Consumer Price Index report showed annual inflationreached 3% last month,the highest level since January. The most recent jobs report the BLS produced showedunemployment crept up to 4.3%in August and the economy added just 22,000 jobs that month. And, for the first time in several years, there arenot enough jobsfor everyone seeking employment, with roughly 7.2 million open roles but around 7.4 million unemployed people.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/05\/economy\/us-jobs-private-sector-adp-october","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"No one can seem to kill America\u2019s economy, despite everyone\u2019s best efforts","date":"2025-09-27","body":"Americans hate this economy, but they keep spending like they love it.\nThe Commerce Department reported Friday thatconsumer spending rose 0.6%in August. Although that may not sound like a lot, it represented significantly stronger growth than economists had expected.\nThe report wasn\u2019t an outlier: Retail sales also rose 0.6% in August, the Commerce Departmentsaidin a separate report two weeks ago. Corporate earnings and sales have proven resilient in the past quarter, with many companies saying customers continue to give them business despite concerns about a flagging economy. And arevised report issued Thursdayon the second-quarter gross domestic product, the broadest measure of US economic growth, showed that GDP grew by the fastest rate in almost two years, buoyed by strong consumer spending.\nStill, this economy\u2019s ratings are in the toilet. The University of Michigan reported Friday that consumer sentiment fell to anindex level of 55.1, the seventh-lowest reading dating back to 1952. That\u2019s unsurprising considering prices keep creeping higher, giving Americans PTSD from the post-pandemic inflation crisis that sent prices soaring during the middle of former President Joe Biden\u2019s term.\nAmericans consistentlyrate the economyas the most important issue for the country, according toCNN polling conducted by SSRS. And as prices keep rising \u2013 theannual inflation rate rose to 2.9% in August, the highest since January, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released earlier this month \u2013 their opinion about the economy is sinking fast.\nNot helping: President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Despite polling showing tariffs are his lowest-rated issue \u2013 by far \u2013 Trump continues to double down on his extraordinary trade policy. On Thursday, Trump announced new tariffs ondrugs,furniture, trucks and cabinets. And he promised more are on the way. Recent consumer price reports have shown that histariffs are in part to blamefor inflation\u2019s slow but steady rebound.\nAlso not helping:Hiring has come to a standstill. America actually lost jobs in June, the first time that happened in any month since December 2020.\nAnd yet, America\u2019s economy keeps humming along. The Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow tool predicts that the US economy will expand at an annual rate near 4% this quarter, which ends Tuesday \u2013 a stunning achievement considering the toxic mix of slow hiring, rising prices, high interest rates and lackluster consumer sentiment.\nHow can the economy get such terrible grades even as it\u2019s growing at such a strong pace?\nPart of the answer is \u201cvibes,\u201d that oft-used and nebulous term that was used to describe similar consumer behavior during the recent inflation crisis. Despite record-low consumer sentiment (just below today\u2019s moribund levels), people kept spending their way through 2022 and 2023 like it was nothing. Jobs were plentiful. People still had plenty of pandemic-era savings stored up. So they dialed back on discretionary purchases (everyone already fixed up their home and bought a treadmill during the pandemic, anyway),  but they kept buying the stuff they needed.\nThat\u2019s why the term \u201cvibecession\u201d became a go-to for economists during the Biden years: The economyfeltlike it stunk, but it actually was doing just fine.\nThere are elements of that this time around. The economic data may be headed in the wrong direction, but it\u2019s still relatively strong. Inflation is rising, but it\u2019s gaining quite slowly and is nowhere near the 9.1% annual rate from 2022 \u2013 a four-decade high. Job growth is slowing, but it\u2019s still growing, and unemployment remains historically low. And many Americans still have pandemic-era ultra-low mortgage rates to help them weather price increases.\n\u201cDownbeat sentiment stands in stark contrast to encouraging hard data,\u201d said Oren Klachkin, economist at Nationwide Financial Markets. \u201cEven though they feel negative, consumers continue to spend. We put more stock in the hard than soft data.\u201d\nAnother reason for bad grades in a good economy: Wealthier Americans are doing just fine, while people with fewer means are struggling. Economists call it a\u201cK-shaped\u201d economy.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell earlier this month commented on that phenomenon and why the bifurcation can help the economy in aggregate, even if many people are struggling.\n\u201cConsumer spending numbers were well above expectations, and that may well be skewed toward higher earning consumers. There\u2019s a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that,\u201d Powell said. \u201cNonetheless, it\u2019s spending. So I think the economy is moving along.\u201d\nRegardless of the reasons, the fact that consumers are still willing to spend is undoubtedly good news: America\u2019s GDP is more than two-thirds comprised of consumer spending. As long as people keep shelling out, America\u2019s massive and diverse economy will keep running just fine.\nOf course, recessions happen sometimes. And there are plenty of warning signs coming from all parts of the US economy.\nHiring has been in a yearlong slump, and monthly job gains recently fell below the amount needed to keep up with America\u2019s population gain. The Black unemployment rate has surged in recent months \u2013 often a precursor to more broad-based layoffs. If job growth turns into job losses, America\u2019s economy could turn on a dime.\nA looming government shutdown threatens to upset the economic balance as well \u2013 particularly if the Trump administration makes good on its threat to permanently eliminate thousands of government jobs that would be furloughed.\nThere is some reason to suspect that spending may have been artificially boosted in recent months. For example, August is a back-to-school month, when many people have little choice but to spend. The next few months could get ugly if consumer sentiment continues to slump and Americans opt to rein in their spending.\n\u201cConsumers are becoming less uncertain about the path of future inflation, but many expect higher prices,\u201d said Klachkin. \u201cAlongside slower income growth and high prices and interest rates, this should contribute to a moderation in consumer spending growth.\u201d\nMany Americans are shelling out on their credit cards and buy-now-pay-later loans, which carry astronomical interest rates. Credit scores last yearfell at the fastest pace since the Great Recessionas the cost of living rose and long-paused student debt payments restarted.\nMeanwhile, stocks continue to surge to record highs, giving investors a strong sense of invincibility. But stocks are at another record high: their relative price compared to companies\u2019 sales and profit expectations. That suggests the market has gotten seriously expensive and may be in an AI-induced bubble that could be close to bursting.\nTariffs continue to pose a threat to the economy, too. Despite relatively low inflation after Trump imposed historic tariffs, businesses may soon need to pass along more of their added costs to consumers.\nRecent producer prices reports show that wholesalers are absorbing much of the tariff costs, but theirprofit margins are getting significantly squeezed. Citi economist Nathan Sheets estimated that consumers have borne only about 30% to 40% of the cost of tariffs, and that balance could soon shift as company shareholders demand profit growth.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/27\/economy\/economy-inflation-tariffs-sentiment-jobs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"The Fed\u2019s newest governor brings a Trump perspective on the economy. Is anyone buying it?","date":"2025-11-09","body":"The Federal Reserve\u2019s newest policymaker has an unconventional perspective on the US economy that\u2019s proving tough to sell.\nIn September, President Donald Trump appointed Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to temporarily fill a vacated seat on the Fed\u2019s powerful Board of Governors. So far, Miran has participated in two Fed meetings \u2014 and broken ranks with the vast majority of Fed officials each time.\nAt the central bank\u2019s October policy meeting, Miran dissented from Fed officials\u2019 decisionto lower interest rates by a quarter point, backing a larger, half-point cut instead, just as he did in September.\nHe hasn\u2019t wasted any time to leave a first impression in other ways, too.\nIn his first month as a central banker, Miran spoke publicly about the US economy at more than a dozen events and media interviews. Fed officials typically do only about a handful of public engagements in their first month.\nLike Trump, Miran hasrepeatedly called for aggressive interest rate cuts. He has argued that borrowing costs are exerting more pressure on the economy than most think and that there\u2019s \u201csubstantial disinflation\u201d coming down the pike \u2014 views Miran proclaims as \u201cout of consensus.\u201d\nHe reiterated his stance in a Wednesday interview with Yahoo Finance.\nNot everyone is sold on Miran\u2019s takes on the economy.\n\u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t characterize anything that he\u2019s saying as ridiculous,\u201d David Seif, chief economist for developed markets at Nomura, said in an interview with CNN after he moderated a discussion with Miran in Washington, DC. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a debate on the inputs that he\u2019s putting into his economic modeling, which are controversial.\u201d\n\u201cI think only time will tell if he ends up being right,\u201d Seif said.\nThere\u2019s no \u2018material inflation from tariffs,\u2019 says new central banker Stephen Miran\nMiran\u2019s rationale for significant rate cuts is mostly based on how he views Trump\u2019s sweeping economic policies andhis expectation that Trump\u2019s tariffs won\u2019t stoke inflation.\nIn his first big speech after being sworn in as a Fed governor, Miran explained how Trump\u2019s policies may be contributing to a lower \u201cneutral rate of interest,\u201d which is a theoretical level of borrowing costs that neither stimulates nor dampens the US economy.\nMiran specifically pointed to the administration\u2019s aggressive crackdown on immigration, the president\u2019s signature tax and spending bill passed by Congress earlier this year, and Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs.\nIn Miran\u2019s view, that means the Fed has a lot of catching up to do to bring rates back to a more neutral level, and he believes time is of the essence.\n\u201cIf you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,\u201d he told The New York Times in an interview that published on November 1. \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason to run that risk if I\u2019m not concerned about inflation on the upside.\u201d\nAdditionally, Miran has said the ongoing mass deportations should take some pressure off the housing market, further lowering rates and resulting in \u201csubstantial disinflation.\u201d He has also frequently downplayed the potential impacts of tariffs on consumer prices.\nMiran, who earned a PhD in economics from Harvard University, is still widely seen as a serious economist, but his ideas have had some pushback.\nFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was critical last month of Miran\u2019s debut speech as a Fed governor.\n\u201cI cannot remember an analytically weaker speech given before the New York Economic Club or given by a Fed governor,\u201d Summers told Bloomberg. \u201cIf this was the best case for the radical reduction in interest rates that President Trump has been advocating, then that case is even weaker than I had previously supposed.\u201d\nSome Wall Street economists also haven\u2019t been impressed by Miran\u2019s takes.\n\u201cWe find some of his arguments questionable, others incomplete and almost none persuasive,\u201dMichael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients in late September.\nMiran\u2019s distinct economic reasoning also doesn\u2019t seem to have gained traction with his colleagues on the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee.\nLike other Trump appointees, such as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, Miran agrees that a weaker labor market is at risk of falling off a cliff. But neither Waller nor Bowman have voted for a half-point rate cut, nor have they suggested that the neutral rate is lower than widely understood.\nFed Governor Lisa Cook, inher first speech since Trump said he fired her,  was asked last week how she views the interaction between lower immigration and housing inflation, which is a cornerstone of Miran\u2019s economic views.\nShe subtly rejected that premise, stating \u201cwhen I\u2019m thinking about immigration, I\u2019m typically thinking about the labor market.\u201d\n\u201cI think that that\u2019s the major role that I see in immigration policy,\u201d she said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/09\/economy\/stephen-miran-fed-perspective","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"As the shutdown drags on, here\u2019s how it can drag down the economy","date":"2025-10-31","body":"Thefederal government shutdownhas lasted all month and is on pace to become the longest on record.\nWhile history has shown that the economy typically rebounds from a shutdown within a couple of months, each day it drags on bringsa greater risk that the economywon\u2019t just bend but will start to break \u2014 and rupture livelihoods in the process, economists say.\n\u201cThe economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\nCongressional Budget Office estimates released Wednesday projected that the shutdown has permanently sapped at least $7 billion in output from the economy.\nThe negative effects start to build on themselves very rapidly and the collateral damage becomes more widespread, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG.\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering momentum and mass,\u201d she said.\nPredicting something that has becoming increasingly unpredictable is an impossible task, but here\u2019s a look at how the shutdown could ripple through critical avenues of everyday life.\nPrior to the shutdown, the US job marketwas already on its back.\nIt\u2019s been alow-hire, low-fire, low-churn environment. Employers, frozen by high economic and policy uncertainty, have held off making investments and adding workers. Some businesses have used this period to test the waters onartificial intelligenceand other technologies \u2013 in turn putting to the test that \u201clow-fire\u201d descriptor by announcing mass layoffs in recent weeks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,\u201d Zandi said.\nConsidering that backdrop, the tepid job gains can potentially turn into deeper job losses if safety nets become frayed, more paychecks are missed by federal workers and contractors, and spending pullbacks reverberate through the private sector, causing businesses to lay off workers or shut down, he said.\nA US Chamber of Commerce analysis released this week estimated that 65,500 small business contractors have billions of dollars in payments at risk because of the shutdown \u2014 $12 billion in payments for the month alone.\nRate cuts and some greater clarity around trade deals and tariffs were supposed to fuel a rebound in hiring heading into 2026, noted Nicole Bachaud, labor economist at employment site ZipRecruiter.\n\u201cHowever, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year\u2019s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,\u201d she wrote in a note earlier this month. \u201cThis would delay hiring plans that might otherwise materialize, keeping the labor market stuck in place.\u201d\nUS consumer confidence during October dipped to its lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump announced a massive suite of steep tariffs on imported goods, according to The Conference Board\u2019s latest index released this week.\nThe expiration of the enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage is at thecrux of the Congressional stalemateto fund the federal government and end the shutdown.\nDemocrats are demanding that a short-term funding package include an extension of the enhanced assistance, whileRepublicans say they won\u2019t negotiateuntil the government reopens.\nOpen enrollment starts on November 1, and the more than 22 million Americans who use the federal health insurance marketplace areexpected to see their monthly premium leapby 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis.\nAlso on November 1, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico are at risk oflosing access to Head Start programs, which provide early education and child development resources to low-income households.\nAny center closures could quickly increase financial hardship for lower-earnings families. Child care disruptions have been shown tonegatively impact labor force participation(particularlyfor women), productivity growth and overall economic growth.\nThe lengthier the shutdown, the higher the probability for a greater drag on overall economic activity, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.\n\u201cAnd this isn\u2019t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you\u2019re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said.\nThere\u2019s the job that doesn\u2019t get filled, the trip that doesn\u2019t get taken and the holiday spending that doesn\u2019t occur.\n\u201cAt some point, things start to break because they\u2019re just not getting done,\u201d added Zandi, of Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWhen this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence \u2013 consumer, business, investor confidence \u2013 the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.\u201d\nIf the shutdown continues past Thanksgiving, \u201cthere\u2019s no coming back from that quickly,\u201d he said, adding that once it passes that \u201cpoint of no return,\u201d it will cause \u201cdamage that\u2019s longer-lasting.\u201d\nConsumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. It has remainedlargely resilient, despite massive uncertainty and persistently high inflation.\nHowever, it\u2019s likely done so because of an increasingly bifurcated, or\u201cK-shaped\u201d economy. Wealthy consumers, buoyed in part by strong market gains, are driving more of the spending while lower- and middle-income households are facing increased strain.\nA drawn-out shutdown could inject further \u201ccrosscurrents\u201d into an alreadychoppy price environment, Zandi said.\nOn one hand, disruptions to government services and funding could affect trade and supply chains, driving up prices. On the other hand, a weakened economy would mean it\u2019s harder for companies to raise prices, which could help keep overall inflation in check.\n\u201cThe net of all that, I think, is hard to know,\u201d he said.\nStill, the shutdown and its economic fallout could give the Federal Reserve one more reason tocontinue cutting interest rates, he added.\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis [shutdown] would weaken the already fragile job market more.\u201d\nThe shutdown could very well exacerbate those struggles for many Americans, especially people on the margins.\nMost Americans are \u201cnot taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they\u2019re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThe economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think so.\u201d\nA lack of funding for safety net programs,particularly the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, could not only exacerbate hunger and hardship for tens of millions of Americans, but also threatens to destabilize local economies, especially in rural areas.\n\u201cIt just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,\u201d KPMG economist Swonk said. \u201cLow- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you see the struggles we\u2019re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,\u201d she added.\nCNN\u2019s Tami Luhby contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/31\/economy\/us-government-shutdown-economy-snowball","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"A Trump-Xi trade deal won\u2019t fix either country\u2019s economy","date":"2025-10-30","body":"The extraordinary trade war President Donald Trump unleashed has been taking a toll on the Chinese and American economies. China is in a far more precarious state, mostly due to preexisting problems, butthe new trade agreementis unlikely to move the dial much for either of the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nOn the surface, the headlines coming out of the historic meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping suggest a big victory for both sides. The agreement calls for the United States to lower tariffs on China by 10%, bringing the effective rate on Chinese exports down to 47%; and for China to delay export controls on rare earths and increase purchases of American soybeans.\nSuch measures might alleviate some of the pain businesses and consumers have felt since Trump returned to office. However, it\u2019s going to take a lot more to address the wounds that have been festering.\nFor one particular part of the American economy that\u2019s been hurting the most from the resurgent trade war with China, the agreement may be coming too late.\nAmerican soybean farmershave been reelingfrom China\u2019s effective embargo on the commodity that began in May, when higher tariffs went into place. Up until this week, China hadn\u2019t purchased any American soybeans, the top agricultural export for the US. China has historically been the largest export market for American soybeans, so the embargo has significantly depressed American soybean prices for the past few months.\nAnd even though Trump said China will buy \u201ctremendous amounts\u201d of soybeans, withpeak harvest season already in full swing, many US farmers may have already sold crop yields at lower prices.\nTrump inherited a labor market that was already weakening, and the latest data shows that hiringslowed to a crawl in recent months.\nHis aggressive and unpredictable tariffs have only exacerbated that, as businesses have become hesitant to hire more workers due to uncertainty. Increasingly, US companies are now laying off workers, too. For the first time in years, there are more people unemployed than jobs available, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAdvances in artificial intelligence are also playing in to some layoffs, as highlighted byAmazon\u2019s massive job cutsthis week. And while rate cuts have traditionally been the Federal Reserve\u2019s primary tool to support the labor market, central bankers say AI may already have caused systemic damage that can\u2019t be fixed through monetary policy.\nFed Governor Christopher Waller noted in recent remarks that even over a longer horizon, \u201cif AI constitutes a structural shift in the demand for labor, monetary policy will not be an effective tool.\u201d\nMoreover, there are growing concerns that lower rates could do more harm than good, pushing up inflation at a time when goods and services are alreadymore expensive. Some of that inflation is attributable to higher tariffs, and some is from tighter immigration controls that have cut back on the supply of workers in areas like child care and farming.\nFor China, while its exports have shown remarkable resilience this year in the face of Trump\u2019s global tariff offensive, its longstanding domestic economic woes have persisted to the point where there are even fewer immediate benefits of a trade deal compared to the United States.\nChief among the factors clouding China\u2019s economic outlook are a prolonged property downturn, persisting deflation, dampened consumer confidence and high youth unemployment.\n\u201cBeyond a cyclical impulse, it\u2019s hard to see today\u2019s revised trade terms as materially shifting China\u2019s more structural challenges at home, where we think tariffs are, if anything, fading in macro relevance,\u201d Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at research firm Oxford Economics, said in a note on Thursday.\nShe added that the fentanyl-related tariff reduction as part of the Thursday deal could at best add a \u201cmarginal\u201d 0.2% upside to China\u2019s growth forecast next year.\nRecent economic data from China continues to paint a gloomy picture. In September, the decline in China\u2019s factory-gate prices, a gauge of deflation, extended into the 36th straight month, though the drop has narrowed following Beijing\u2019s attempt in recent months to rein in price competition in certain sectors. China\u2019s much-touted electric vehicle industry, for example, has been embroiled in a relentless race to the bottom, partly due to excess capacity.\nIt\u2019s also not helping that consumer demand is on the decline, as evidenced by the pace of retail sales slowing to a 10-month low at 3% in September compared with a year ago.\nAdding to the mix of challenges, China\u2019s new home prices sank in September at their fastest pace in 11 months, despite traditionally being a peak season for property spending. The protracted slump, whichbegan with developers\u2019 debt defaults in 2021, is expected to continue weighing on consumer sentiment.\nThe agreement Trump and Xi reached Thursday can merely be thought of as a rough draft \u2014 nothing has been signed. It\u2019ll likely take several more meetings between American and Chinese counterparts to nail down a firmer agreement that eventually becomes a signed deal. Or it may not even get to that point at all.\nFor now, though, both economies can take some solace in the fact that Trump\u2019s threat of an additional 100% tariff on Chinese exports, which Beijing almost certainly would have retaliated against, is off the table.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/30\/economy\/xi-trump-trade-deal-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

And he can\u2019t seal a deal with a California winemaker to launch a new product line because the government is not approving new labels for bottles during the funding lapse.\n\u201cThe government is still taking money from us, but it\u2019s not paying out what it owes,\u201d he said, referring to the tax credits.\nThe shutdown has frozen many of the government\u2019s key functions, such as lending and processing tax credits. And now without pay, hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country have pulled back on spending, creating economic ripple effects.\nFrom restaurants in Washington, DC, to businesses around national parks, the shutdown\u2019s impact is spreading through the US economy, with no relief in sight.\nSean Han, chef manager at Market to Market, a cafeteria at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, said foot traffic has declined about 20% to 30% since the government shutdown began \u2014 during a year that has already been tough because of mass federal layoffs.\nThe business hasn\u2019t reduced employees\u2019 hours yet, he said, but that could happen \u2014 in addition to the possibility of layoffs \u2014 if the shutdown drags on for longer. With fewer customers, Han said he directed workers to focus on giving whoever comes in a better dining experience.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been around for about 20 years, so we\u2019ve seen this before,\u201d Han said. \u201cBut it took us nine months to recover after the pandemic and we\u2019ll have to rebuild again once this ends.\u201d\nRestaurant reservations in Washington were down 9% last week compared to the same week a year earlier, according to data from OpenTable.\nIn North Carolina, Pam Anderson is caring for only a handful of dogs at her Ocean Sands K-9 Resort in Kill Devil Hills.\nSome of her local clients have been calling off or shortening their vacations because the impasse has affected the national parks, or they are federal employees who are not being paid. At the same time, she is not getting any bookings from tourists, which she suspects is because the popular Wright Brothers National Memorial has shuttered.\nJust this week, a local family who planned to leave their two dogs with her for a few days in mid-November pulled out, which will cost her $500 in lost revenue. The couple works for the federal government.\nAlthough the kennel had a \u201crocking September,\u201d reservations are down 40% for October and 60% for November so far compared to last year, leading Anderson and her husband to tighten their belts. They have stopped going out to dinner a few times a week and are holding off on their charitable giving.\n\u201cI told my husband the other day, \u2018Don\u2019t spend any money\u2019,\u201d said Anderson, 70, who is thinking of getting a night job.\nLast March, restauranteur Fran Bolden opened a cafeteria at the Redstone Arsenal, a US Army base near Huntsville, Alabama. It was a profitable side venture for Bolden in a town whoseeconomic lifelineis the military, defense and aerospace industries.\nBut that restaurant, Arsenal Eats, is now shuttered until the government reopens. Bolden said they usually expect around 150 people a day for breakfast and lunch; the past two weeks saw only between 25 to 30.\n\u201cThe volume is just not there,\u201d she said.\nBusinesses all over downtown Huntsville and beyond are feeling the pinch, she said, and small businesses bear a big brunt of the burden.\n\u201cThe local economy is in a military city. With people not out, not spending money, not sure what to do \u2013 we rely on the business of these people in order to be able to sustain ourselves,\u201d Bolden said.\nFor the past two years, toddlers at Bernard Jackson\u2019s swim and wellness center in Washington, DC, have learned to float for the first time, and seniors in their eighties have practiced gentle exercises to stay strong.\nBut the shutdown has taken a heavy toll. With fewer families able to afford lessons and operating costs on the rise, Jackson has had to make difficult choices just to keep his doors open. Many of his clients are federal employees directly affected by the lapse in pay.\n\u201cSince people are not getting paid, they aren\u2019t coming to their lessons,\u201d Jackson told CNN as he was leaving an unemployment center.\n\u201cI can tell you at least 40% of my revenue has gone down.\u201d\nEven as attendance drops, Jackson is finding ways to support his clients. He continues to send instructions and exercises for them to practice at home.\n\u201cThe pool is still open,\u201d he said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/24\/business\/government-shutdown-business-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"How bad is America\u2019s economy, really?","date":"2025-09-09","body":"It\u2019s getting harder to argue that the US economy is in good shape. At least, notwithout a ton of footnotes, caveats and fine print.\nConcerns about the economy are validated most easily in the labor market, which, by practically all accounts, is looking bleaker and bleaker by the day. Andinflation has started tocreep up again. A key consumer inflation report due Thursday is expected to show the pace of price increases picked up in August.\nThis all comes as businesses remain in a state of paralysis over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff rollout. The hefty taxes have caused employers to veer away from taking on more workers, particularly in tariff-sensitive sectors like construction and manufacturing, where companies are cutting their workforces.\nThe economic reality has earned Trump negative marks with voters,according to recent polls.\nBut despite that, consumer spending \u2014 the backbone of the economy \u2014has stayed strong. However, credit card debt is at a record high, with the share of serious delinquencies \u2014 people carrying a balance for over 90 days \u2014 at the highest levels in over a decade, according to second-quarter data from the New York Federal Reserve.\nThe S&P 500 has alsonotched record highs this year. Much of the recent gains, though, are being fueled by investors\u2019 growing belief that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its meeting next week and at the remaining ones this year. That\u2019s because dismal jobs data has created more of an urgency for the central bank to support the economy.\nAfter an incredible post-pandemic run, the once seemingly unbreakable American economy is bending. But it\u2019s certainly not broken.\nData last week revealed thatfor the first time in four years, there are more people looking for work than there are jobs available for them. Then came Friday\u2019s dismal jobs report, which showed employers hired just 22,000 new workers last month and the unemployment rate rose to the highest level since 2021. The labor force snapshot also revealed that the US economy lost 13,000 workers in June, marking the first month since 2020 when employers laid off more workers than they hired.\nThis week kicked off with new survey data released by the New York Federal Reserve indicating that job seekers believe there\u2019s a 44.9% chance of finding a new job if they currently don\u2019t have one. That\u2019s the lowest reading on record since the survey began in 2013. It also represents a nearly 6% decline from July to August.\nOver the next year, respondents also foresee a rising unemployment rate, lower earnings growth potential and a higher chance of losing their jobs.\nThen on Tuesday,new revised figuresfrom the BLS revealed that employers hired nearly a million fewer workers than previously thought for the 12 months ended in March.\nFor now though, the unemployment rate, which rose to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July, is still below historic averages: Since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began reporting on the nation\u2019s unemployment rate using current methodologies in 1948, it\u2019s averaged 5.7%.\nInflation remains below historic levels, too. The nation\u2019s annual inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Indexis 2.7% as of July.That\u2019s nearly a percentage point lower than the average rate dating back to 1948, according to BLS data. But consumers are bracing for annual inflation to climb to a 3.2% pace over the next 12 months, according to fresh New York Fed survey data released Monday. This comes as businesses have been shouldering hefty tariff bills since Trump ratcheted up his import taxes in the spring. Many retailers have started passing on costs to consumers by raising prices \u2014 and are warning of more to come.\nStill, Alexander Field, an economics professor at Santa Clara University\u2019s Leavey School of Business, said, \u201cIt is not hard to perceive ominous storm clouds on the horizon.\u201d\n\u201cThere is, of course, no guarantee that ominous clouds will deliver the future they seem to portend. But there is simply no plausible case today that the economy is doing really well now,\u201d he said.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s equity team has a different view, instead predicting that what the US economy has experienced over the past few months is the worst it\u2019s going to get for some time, barring substantially changing circumstances.\nIn a note published Monday, they wrote the latest jobs report supports their long-held belief that the US economy has been in a \u201crolling recession,\u201d where certain sectors feel a marked slowdown while others continue humming along. That\u2019s in contrast to a traditional recession when almost all parts of the economy get dragged down.\nNow, the economy is shifting to a \u201crolling recovery,\u201d they said.\n\u201cCentral to our view is the notion that the economy has been much weaker for many companies and consumers over the past three years than what the headline economic statistics like nominal GDP or employment suggest,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe think a better way to measure the health of the economy is earnings growth (and breadth) as well as consumer and corporate confidence surveys.\u201d\nMore companies are reporting higher future earnings growth potential compared to the past three years. \u201cWe think this supports the notion that the worst of the rolling recession is behind us,\u201d they said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/09\/economy\/how-bad-is-the-economy-really","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The cat is both dead and alive; the economy is both weak and strong; AI is an overhyped bubble and AI is the future of everything; the Dodgers and the Blue Jays are both winning and losing the World Series.\nThese opposing situations will eventually resolve, of course, but in the meantime all most of us can do is flip a coin and hope for the best.\nThe struggles in the lower rung similarly reflect a fragile holding pattern.\nFurther complicating all of that: The Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to cut interest rates this week, is flying blind without the regular government data it and countless business leaders rely on.\nBottom line: The economy may be part of the reason you feel uneasy, whether you\u2019re riding high on AI fervor or just trying to make rent month to month.\nFor investors, Shvets and Liu recommended that in this Schrodinger\u2019s cat moment of uncertainty, either \u201cgo passive and spread risks widely\u201d or focus on longer-term value investments over short-term shiny objects. \u201cBoth require lowering noise and tuning out news feeds as counterproductive distractions.\u201d\n\u201cWill there be peace or war? Both. Will AI raise productivity or fall in a collapsing bubble? Both,\u201d they write. \u201c\u2026Keep investment focus on the future.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/28\/business\/economy-tense-nightcap","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Confused about the economy? You\u2019re not alone","date":"2025-08-01","body":"If news about inflation, trade, the Federal Reserve and jobs has you confused and you\u2019re not sure what to make of the US economy, don\u2019t worry: You\u2019re in good company.\nBut this weekoffered a ton of informationthat provided a more focused \u2014 if not exactly crystal clear \u2014 picture of what\u2019s happening with America\u2019s economy.\nWe got reports on inflation, gross domestic product, jobs and consumer sentiment, a Fed rate decision and a flurry of trade announcements, all of which removed varying degrees of uncertainty about where the economy has been heading.\nIf you\u2019re just looking for the tl;dr, here are the big takeaways from this week:\nIf you crave context and don\u2019t mind a slightly unabridged rundown, here you go:\nTrump\u2019s historic trade agenda was expected to turn the economy on its head. That hasn\u2019t happened \u2014 at least, not yet.\nThe lack of a sudden recession, as many feared, has given investors confidence that they can safely ignore trade \u2014 and stocks have risen to all-time highs in recent weeks. It has also given Trump confidence that he can raise tariffs dramatically, as he just did on Friday. Even with a flurry of 11th-hour trade agreements, America\u2019s effective tax rate on imported goods has shot above 18%. It stood at just 1.2% last year. That couldadd $2,400 in costsfor the average American household, according to Yale\u2019s Budget Lab.\nThe economy has remained surprisingly strong this year, which perhaps shouldn\u2019t have come as such a shock: America is the world\u2019s largest and most complex economy, with a multitude of natural resources.\nHowever, economists warn that tariff effects are just starting to become apparent, and they could escalate in the second half of 2025.\nTariffs left a bigger mark on goods prices in June,which in turn put upward pressure on overall inflation. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, a mouthful best known as the Fed\u2019s favored inflation gauge, showed that prices rose 0.3% in June from May, boosting the annual rate of inflation to 2.6% from 2.4%.\nThat 2.6% is the highest rate in four months and marks a step in the wrong direction from what the Fed wants to see, which is inflation at 2%. And that 0.3% monthly hike, if continued, would drive that annual rate well north of 3%.\nThe PCE price index painted a similar picture to the June Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index: More businesses were seeing higher costs because of tariffs and passing some of those on to consumers.\nAnd while the expansive and expensive tariffs aren\u2019t expected to trigger an inflationary surge like we saw in 2022, annual inflation is expected to bounce back above 3%. But as we learned and felt coming down from that recent inflation high, when price levels rise for a broad suite of commonly purchased items, it takes a big bite out of Americans\u2019 hard-earned pay.\nEconomists expected that job growth would slow in July. After all, uncertainty has stifled businesses\u2019 hiring plans for several months running now. Plus, job gains are becoming increasingly concentrated in a select few industries: health care, education and (especially during the summer) leisure and hospitality businesses.\nBut hiring wassignificantly slower in Julythan expected. And May and June were also revised down sharply, suggesting that the job market may be considerably worse than we had previously expected.\nThrough July, the US has added an average of just 85,000 jobs per month. That\u2019s pretty weak and slightly below the breakeven employment level, in which the jobs added are enough to keep up with labor force growth and hold the unemployment rate steady.\nOutside of the pandemic recession in 2020, that current pace is the weakest January-to-July average since 2010, when the US economy was licking its wounds from the Great Recession.\nSome tariff-sensitive goods\u2014 think: washers, dryers, furniture, clothes, shoes, toys, sporting goods and curtains (window and floor covering prices surged by a record 4.2% in June) \u2014 are on the rise, but consumers are generally holding up okay.\nA slice of the population has benefited from stock market gains, as potential tariff rates come into better focus and boost investors\u2019 confidence. The broader populace is still seeing pay gains outpace inflation (although to a lesser extent than recent years).\nThe Thursday reportthat contained the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge also provided the most comprehensive look at how US households\u2019 income, savings and spending are faring.\nConsumers spent more in June than they did in May, with expenditures rising 0.3% from the month before (0.1% when adjusting for inflation). Those are modest gains, but they are still gains.\n\u201cConsumers are in a position to handle this, though consumer psychology is a fickle thing,\u201d Gus Faucher, chief economist for the PNC Financial Services Company, told CNN Thursday. \u201cThe (spending and inflation data) does not suggest that a recession is imminent. But I think what it does suggest is that we\u2019re starting to see some cracks; and, if there is something else that goes wrong, then the economy is vulnerable to a downturn.\u201d\nPresidential excoriations (and back slaps) aside, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the rest of the Fed have their work cut out for them. Atthe conclusion of a two-day policy meeting Wednesday,Powell \u2014 a target of Trump\u2019s ire because the Fed has kept interest rates high \u2014 kept interest rates high again.\nPowell\u2019s rationale: The economy is strong enough to support higher interest rates. And it\u2019s not yet clear whether tariffs will raise prices a bit or a lot. Keeping interest rates steady could help to keep inflation in check.\nTrump and his economic advisers have claimed that the Fed\u2019s high rates are hurting Americans\u2019 ability to get a mortgage. The Fed\u2019s rates may influence consumer loan rates \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t set them. That\u2019s the bond market, and Trump\u2019s massively expensive domestic policy agenda, his tariffs and even his constant blasting of Powell have made bonds relatively unattractive to investors.\nBecause yields and prices trade in opposite direction, Trump has his own share of blame for high mortgage rates. But Trump may get what he wants in September: Expectations for a Fed rate cut shot higher Friday after a weaker-than-expected jobs report.\nThis week, we got our first glimpse at America\u2019s second-quarter gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy. And economists are still trying to figure out what it means.\nThe headline number looked strong: A 3% annualized growth rate is good by anyone\u2019s measure. Consumer spending, the backbone of America\u2019s economy, picked up. And, most importantly, America\u2019s economy is growing again, after shrinking in the first quarter.\nBut when you peer more closely into the data, it becomes apparent that tariffs are masking a hidden weakness in the US economy.\nImporters scrambled to stockpile a ton of goods before tariffs went into effect in the first quarter, widening America\u2019s trade imbalance to historic levels and making the economy appear much worse off than it actually was.\nIn the second quarter, as tariffs took effect, imports plunged and companies sold off their inventories. That narrowed the trade gap, making the economy look better off than it actually was.\nSo what\u2019s actually happening? Something in between: America\u2019s economy remained strong but slowing in the first half of this year. Consumer spending may have bounced back, but it remained weak \u2014 and businesses are growing cautious.\nThe blizzard of economic data and activity this week largely came in line with expectations, with the major exception of jobs. The overall picture may give some reassurance that the economy is doing mostly okay (accompanied by some caveats or asterisks).\nBut the jobs and trade data is worrying.\n\u201cThe events and data of this week paint a picture of an economy that is slowing and will continue to slow through the back half of the year,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN in an interview Friday.\nAnd while Daco believes that a recession is not necessarily imminent, Thursday night\u2019s trade blitz and Friday\u2019s jobs report raise those odds.\n\u201cThis type of very weak job growth momentum is essentially eroding the economy\u2019s bugger against headwinds,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd and in an environment where the US economy is subject to historic supply shocks, that will essentially expose it to the risk of a of a recession.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/08\/01\/business\/economy-explained","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"\u2018It\u2019s killing business\u2019: Trump\u2019s mass deportation push is crushing local economies","date":"2025-10-16","body":"In Chicago\u2019s Little Village, the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping deportation push has paralyzed the economy.\nBusiness owners inLittle Village, which is81% Hispanic, said customers are too frightened to walk the streets of Chicago\u2019s second busiest commercial corridor. Sales have plunged, employees are staying home, and stores have temporarily closed since the administration\u2019s deportation push in Chicago began on September 8. More than 1,000 people have been arrested in the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s\u201cOperation Midway Blitz.\u201d\nThe economic fallout from deportations is typically focused on the impact to industries with large unauthorized immigrant workforces, such as construction and agriculture. But undocumented immigrants aren\u2019t just people who simply go to work each day. They\u2019re consumers, too. They spent roughly$300 billionin 2023, buying goods and services that power the economy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s killing business,\u201d said Mike Moreno, the owner ofMoreno\u2019sliquor store and speakeasy bar. His father opened the store in Little Village in the 1970s, and it was the first Latino-owned liquor store in Illinois.\nHe said sales have dropped 60% since September. Local residents and longtime business owners alike have been traumatized by immigration agents roaming around the neighborhood, Moreno said, arresting both unauthorized immigrants and US citizens.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going up and down the streets around in loops to scare us,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought in a million years I\u2019d see something like this.\u201d\nMarcela Rodriguez, a franchise operator ofLos Mangos, a small Mexican-style ice cream chain, said \u201cpeople are not stepping outside. Kids are not going to school. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\nHer business \u201cjust completely went downhill\u201d beginning in September, and several fearful employees changed their schedules to prepare food when the store is locked and closed to customers.\nIce cream sales now correlate with how visible immigration agents are in the neighborhood, she said.\n\u201cOn quiet days with not a lot of detainments, we see an uptick in customers.\u201d\nThe Trump administrationsaidlast month it\u2019s on track to deport 600,000 unauthorized immigrants this year.\nBut that push is hurting businesses and local economies that rely on immigrants, both legal and undocumented, who buy everything from food to cars to homes.\nA record 14 million unauthorized immigrants, roughly 5.6% of total households,livedin the United States in 2023. Twenty-six million people live in a household with at least one person who lacks legal status.\nNot only does this group spend hundreds of billions annually, they alsopaidmore than $90 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2024, helping fund social services and programs like Social Security. Sales, property, business and other taxes they paid help prop up municipal and state budgets.\nThat\u2019s why a slowdown in Little Village threatens to have a spillover effect on Chicago. The city may see lower tax revenues from retail sales, as well as store closures, reduced orders along the supply chain, and a hit to the real estate market, said Teresa C\u00f3rdova, the director of theGreat Cities Instituteat the University of Illinois Chicago.\nLittle Village became a landing spot for Hispanic immigrants coming to the United States beginning in the 1960s and 1970s. They helped stabilize the neighborhood, which hademptied outas Chicago lost manufacturing jobs and people left for the suburbs.\n\u201cWere it not for Latinos in Chicago, we would not be able to revitalize like we did,\u201d C\u00f3rdova said.\nA similar story of immigrants reviving areas in decline played out in many northern industrial cities during the mid-twentieth century and later in the South, said A. K. Sandoval-Strausz, a history professor at Penn State University and author of thebook\u201cBarrio America: How Latino Immigrants Saved the American City.\u201d\n\u201cThe influx of immigrants to these neighborhoods has been an economic lifeline,\u201d he said.\nBut White House spokesperson Kush Desai called looking at how much unauthorized immigrants spend and pay in taxes in isolation an \u201cidiotic exercise\u201d because \u201cthe costs that Americans pay due to illegal immigration are incalculable: crime, strained healthcare systems, inflated real estate costs, and schools being overburdened with costly ESL students.\u201d\nThe White House pointed toresearchfrom the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for lower immigration levels, that said American taxpayers spend at least $182 billion annually to cover costs for unauthorized immigrants.\nImmigrants and families unsure of their future in the United States are sending more money to their home countries \u2014 remittances to many Latin American countries are seeingdouble-digit increases\u2014 and they\u2019re tightening their wallets.\nTD Bank estimated that undocumented workers who are spending less will subtract 0.7 percentage points from consumer spending growth this year.\nWhen Tricolor, a subprime auto lender primarily for unauthorized immigrants in the Southwest, filed forbankruptcylast month, analysts said it was a sign of the pressure on the economy catering to undocumented immigrants.\nMajor food brands and retailers are also noticing an impact.\nPepsiCo, Constellation Brands, Mondelez, Wingstop and Ross said Hispanic customers are spending less, particularly at stores concentrated in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods.\nSales of Mazola corn oil have dropped among Hispanic consumers in the South, parent company Associated British Foods said last month on an earnings call.\n\u201cWe have a very large share of Hispanic consumers in Mazola, and there\u2019s a lot of fear in that community,\u201d CEO George Weston said. \u201cWe really hope that that\u2019s temporary for all sorts of reasons.\u201d\nBut the administration is ramping up its detention capabilities to reach its goal of one million deportations a year, and Republicans\u2019 One Big Beautiful Bill Acttriplesthe budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nThe further the Trump administration goes, the larger the blow will be to consumer spending, employment and taxes that boost cities and states, said Eric Rodriguez, the senior vice president of policy and advocacy at UnidosUS, a Hispanic civil rights group. Mass deportations have beenfoundto reduce employment and wages for native-born citizens, too.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sign that what we\u2019re seeing right now is going to stop or de-escalate,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the government builds up mass deportations, the economic effects will be greater.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/16\/business\/ice-immigration-trump-chicago-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Big rebound in GDP masks hidden weakness in the US economy","date":"2025-07-30","body":"The US economy expanded sharply in the second quarter as businesses dialed back on imports after stocking up earlier in the year to get ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. But a look under the hood shows an economy that\u2019s sputtering.\nGross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered an annualized rate of 3% in the April-through-June period, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That\u2019s up sharply from the -0.5% rate in the first quarter, which was the first quarterly GDP decline since 2022. Economists polled by data firm FactSet estimated second-quarter GDP to come in at a 2% rate.\nThe latest GDP report is a key part ofan avalanche of economic newsthis week expected to show how consumers and businesses are weathering Trump\u2019s sweeping economic policies. But thetariff-driven buying frenziesin the beginning of the year have made it difficult to assess the underlying health and direction of the world\u2019s largest economy. The back-and-forth stockpiling and selling of inventories before and after Trump imposed tariffs appears to be masking an underlying weakness in consumer and business spending.\nIn the first quarter, surging imports took a toll on economic growth, but that trend reversed in the second quarter as businesses drew from their existing inventories instead of importing, in turn boosting GDP, which is adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation.\nAfter surging nearly 38% from January through March, imports plummeted 30.2% in the following three-month period. That contributed the lion\u2019s share of economic growth from April through June when also factoring in exports, which add to GDP.\nUnderlying details in the report also show that consumers and businesses haven\u2019t quite retrenched in the face of persistent uncertainty about the economy, which is helping propel economic growth.\n\u201cMy motto these past six years at Morgan Stanley is don\u2019t underestimate the resilience of the US economy,\u201d Sarah Wolfe, senior economist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, told CNN. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not in a slowdown, but I think it takes quite a bit to push the US into a recession. We have a pretty dynamic economy, for better or for worse.\u201d\nConsumer spending, which powers about 70% of the US economy, picked up sharply in the second quarter to a 1.4% rate, up from the anemic 0.5% in the first quarter. But, combined with the previous data, it marks the two slowest quarters of spending since the pandemic. Meanwhile, businesses slowed their spending sharply during the same period, to 1.9% from 10.3%, mostly reflecting a recalibration from the front-running earlier in the year.\nStill, the economy isn\u2019t out of the woods and things could take a turn for the worse: A key gauge of underlying demand in the economy \u2014 real final sales to private domestic purchasers, also referred to as \u201ccore GDP\u201d \u2014 slowed in the second quarter to an annualized rate of 1.2%, the weakest pace since the fourth quarter of 2022, down from 1.9% earlier in the year.\n\u201cHeadline numbers are hiding the economy\u2019s true performance, which is slowing as tariffs take a bite out of activity,\u201d Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in commentary issued Wednesday. \u201cIf core GDP performance continues at this pace, we expect there will be even more pressure on the Fed to lower rates as the economy slows.\u201d\nThe economy\u2019s latest health check comes as Federal Reserve officials convene in Washington, DC, for a contentious debate on interest rates.\nThe Fed is expected to announce later Wednesday that it iskeeping interest rates unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting. The move, however, could draw dissents from two Fed governors \u2014 Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman \u2014 which would be the first time two governors have done so in more than 30 years.\nThe economy\u2019s resilience, as evidenced by the latest GDP report, doesn\u2019t help build a convincing case that the Fed needs to be actively considering a rate cut to simulate growth.\nAnd neither has the latest employment data so far, which shows that unemployment remains at historically low levels. On Friday, the Labor Department will report if that\u2019s still the case when it releases its monthly jobs report.\nThe Fed steps in with rate cuts whenever it\u2019s clear that the economy is bound to weaken, pushing up unemployment. In addition to fighting inflation, the Fed is also responsible for keeping the labor market intact.\nBut even if the economy doesn\u2019t fall off a cliff, the Fed is still widely expected to resume rate cuts later this year. Investors expect rate cuts in September and in December, according to futures.\n\u201cThey\u2019re at a moment when most in the (Fed\u2019s rate-setting) committee think it will be appropriate to cut rates fairly soon, but they might be disagreeing over exactly how much evidence they need or how comfortable they have to be before they start cutting rates again,\u201d William English, a former senior Fed adviser, told CNN.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/30\/economy\/us-gdp-q2","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"A battery of new data shows how the US economy is holding up amid Trump\u2019s tariffs","date":"2025-06-26","body":"A deluge of economic data released Thursday should have provided a clearer picture of how the US economy is faring in the face of President Donald Trump\u2019s massive policy shifts. But the latest numbers were a mixed bag, leaving economists still scratching their heads.\nGross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, registered an annualized rate of -0.5% from January through March, the Commerce Department said Thursday in its third and final estimate. That\u2019s worse than the 0.2% decline reported in the second estimate. GDP is adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation.\nRelated articleAmericans cut back sharply on their spending last month amid tariffs\nThe latest estimate showed that consumer spending \u2014 the lifeblood of the US economy \u2014was tepid in the beginning of the year.Spending in the first quarter grew at a rate of just 0.5%, down from 1.2% in an earlier estimate. That\u2019s the weakest rate in more than four years.\nSeparately, new data showed that unemployed Americans are having an increasingly harder time finding work. A deteriorating job market \u2014 if that turns out to be the case \u2014 would not bode well for consumer spending, which already seems to be on shaky ground.\nStill, in a shred of good news, other figures showed that businesses are still investing, despite the persistent uncertainty over Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs and the potential impact of his massive tax and spending bill currently being reviewed by the US Senate.\n\u201cThursday\u2019s GDP is backward looking and stocks already priced in the economic weakness caused by the tariffs during their decline in early April,\u201d Paul Stanley, chief investment officer, Granite Bay Wealth Management, wrote in commentary issued Thursday. \u201cNow, with stocks back at record highs, the market is looking ahead and pricing in an environment where tariffs are lower and that companies will be able to adapt and navigate tariffs.\u201d\nOverall, the latest economic numbers continue to show how tariff fears are weighing on the world\u2019s largest economy as key drivers of growth \u2014 the labor market and spending \u2014 have lost some momentum.\nDespite spending being revised much lower, the main driver of the decline in first-quarter GDP was a massive trade deficit, as American businesses rushed to stock up on imports to get ahead of Trump\u2019s stiff tariffs. The third estimate revised imports down, but they still greatly exceeded exports, which subtracted from GDP.\nFresh data released Thursday morning by the Labor Department showed the number of people receiving jobless benefits for at least one week rose by 37,000 to 1.974 million, marking the highest total since November 6, 2021. Some Fed officials don\u2019t believe that development is concerning.\n\u201cThe data today confirmed that continuing claims are going up because it takes a little longer to find a job. That\u2019s consistent with the hiring numbers just being slower as the economy comes to a more sustainable pace,\u201d San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg. \u201cBut when I look at the labor market, there are really no warning signs that it\u2019s weakening.\u201d\nRelated articleTrump calls Fed Chair Powell an \u2018average mentally person\u2019 and says he\u2019s working on replacements\nThe Commerce Department separately reported on Thursday that new orders for US durable goods surged 16.4% last month, as business demand for transportation equipment ramped up sharply. The overall boost in orders last month came as China lowered tariffs on American exports from 125% to 10%, while the US lowered tariffs on Chinese exports from 145% to 30%.\nNew orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft \u2014 a closely watched proxy for business investment \u2014 grew at a rate of 1.7% in May from the prior month, rebounding sharply from a 1.4% decline in April. That bodes well for economic growth in the second quarter, which will be reported next month.\nBut the latest figures likely don\u2019t have much bearing for Fed officials, who are divided on whether the central bank shouldresume lowering interest rates next month.\n\u201cThe revisions to GDP won\u2019t have significant implications for the Federal Reserve as it\u2019s backward looking. The Fed is focused on the inflation risks stemming from tariffs and the labor market,\u201d Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said in an analyst note Thursday. \u201cIf the Fed pivots and signals that it will cut rates earlier than we anticipate, with the next occurring in December, it will be because of the labor market, not GDP.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace and Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/26\/economy\/us-gdp-q1-final","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The state of the US economy, in 9 charts","date":"2025-03-04","body":"President Donald Trump on Tuesdaywill address Congressfor the first time in his second term, and he\u2019ll do so with an economy that is mostly chugging along.\nHowever, recent data has contained somewarning signalsthat momentum could be slipping at a time when the Trump administration is conducting sweeping \u2014 and potentially economy-shifting \u2014 policy changes.\nHere\u2019s a look at how some key economic indicators are faring:\nThe mighty US consumer, shored up by a strong labor market, helped drive steady economic growththroughout 2024. The US entered 2025 on solid enough footing that economists say it could weather some volatility.\nThrough the fourth quarter of 2024, real gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 the broadest measure of economic output \u2014 grew 2.3%.\nStill, some bumpy times could be coming sooner than later, according to a closely watched predictor of real GDP growth.\nLast week, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s real-time GDP forecast projected the economycould contract by 2.8%. The negative swing doesn\u2019t necessarily signal a recession: It largely reflects a sharper-than-expected pullback in post-holiday consumer spending and a larger inflow of imported goods in advance of tariffs.\nIt remains to be seen how much further consumers could pull back. Recent sentiment surveys have shownAmericans have grown increasingly sour about economic prospects.\nInflation has cooled dramatically since hitting a 40-year high in the summer of 2022; however, the path back to normal has been slow and bumpy. In January, two key inflation gauges (theConsumer Price Indexand theProducer Price Index) ran hot, driven higher by fast-risingfoodand energy prices.\nConcern also have heightened in recent weeks about how Trump administration policies, specifically the implementation of steep import tariffs, could raise prices for consumers and businesses as well as reaccelerate inflation.\nStill, as it stands now, the underlying dataand the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gaugedo provide some silver linings and show that the current path still leads to disinflation. The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures price index rose at an annual rate of 2.5%, half of a percentage point above the Fed\u2019s 2% target rate.\nBut while prices may not be rising as fast as they did in recent years, the cumulative effect of high inflation hasweighed heavily on Americans, especially those who have little wiggle room in their monthly budgets.\nFed up with high prices, many voters brought theirfrustrations to the ballot boxin November in hopes that a change of administration would bring some relief.\nThat hasn\u2019t happened yet (the recent, and global, inflation event had complex causes, and price stabilization is not expected overnight \u2014no matter who\u2019s the president), and the poster child for stubbornly high prices has become the humble egg.\nEgg prices have spikedin recent years because of a nasty and deadly bout of avian flu (and long-established practices to contain the spread).\nThe Trump administration last week laid out afive-pronged planto try to combat bird flu and lower egg prices. While some producers expressed concern that the efforts don\u2019t go far enough, Department of Agriculture officials acknowledged that it could take time to lower prices.\nStocks had a blockbuster2023and2024. Heading into 2025, Wall Street expected the good times for markets to keep going this year \u2014 just not on the massive scale investors have enjoyed lately.\nUS stocks surged last year as strong economic growth, cooling inflation, a series of Federal Reserve rate cuts and enthusiasm for President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election victory boosted investor optimism. Tech and AI stocks were the stars of 2024, and they were largely expected to lead growth again in 2025.\nTwo months into the year, and things have gotten a bit choppy. All three major US indexesclosed out February in the red, signaling risinguneaseon Wall Street.\nWhile the broader market remains near an all-time high, uncertainty has swelled around factors such asartificial intelligence-related spendingas well as broadereconomicandgeopolitical volatility.\nAmerica\u2019s once-in-a-generation housing slump deepened last year, and heading into 2025, it appeared that residential real estate would land in another standoff.\nThat outlook was somewhat dour in part because inventory remains low and mortgage rates are expected tostay above 6%for at least the next two years.Americans who locked inultra-low mortgage rates during the pandemic have little incentive to move into new homes and take on higher borrowing costs.\nAdditionally, homebuilders have sounded the alarm on how Trump\u2019s tariff and immigration policies could have a negative effect on housing costs and supply.\nStill, real estate is local, and with spring just weeks away, there\u2019s renewed optimism incertain US marketsthat the scales could tip back toward homebuyers.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to bring down decades-high inflation with aheavy-handeddose of fast-escalating interest rates were highly expected to blunt demand and result in result in higher unemployment \u2014 and potentiallya recession.\nHowever, the US labor market and broader economy proved resilient, keeping the unemployment rate at historically low levels. For perspective, January\u2019s 4% unemployment rate is below what was seen during practically every month in the 1970s, \u201980s and \u201890s.\nWhile the overall rate remains historically low, the dynamics for people without a job haven\u2019t been the friendliest in recent months.Hiring has softenedand labor market churn has slowed, resulting in people staying unemployed for longer.\nWhile the unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4% when the February jobs report is released this Friday, economists anticipateit could potentially move higher in the months ahead.\nOne particular pressure point could be from the Trump administration\u2019s mass layoffs of federal workers. However, the relative size of those job cuts as well as the timing could lessen their impact on the overall economy.\nThe pace of job growthhas slowed during the past year. That\u2019s been expected: The blockbuster pandemic recovery couldn\u2019t continue forever; plus, the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation-busting high interest rates were designed to curb demand.\nThe US economy kicked off 2025 byadding 143,000 jobs in January. The monthly gain was lower than expected; however, economists noted it was likely influenced by significant data adjustments that happen at the start of every year as well as frigid weather and devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.\nJob gains are expected to rebound somewhat when the February report is released Friday; however, there\u2019s less certainty as to what may come in the months ahead from the federal job cuts as well as other stated policies on fronts such as immigration, tax reform, and trade.\nSales of existing homesin the US fell last year to the lowest level in almost three decades, as sky-high home prices and elevated mortgage rates squeezed home buyers.\nHome prices, meanwhile, continue to escalate. In January, the median price was $446,300, Census Bureau data shows.\nFast-rising housing prices have certainly played their part in keeping overall inflation above the Fed\u2019s target. Shelter inflation, which is anamorphous and laggingmeasure of the average cost of housing in the US, rose to 4.4% year-over-year in January, outpacing overall inflation of 3%.\nThe impact of rising home prices has been felt across most of the country: A recent report from the National Association of Realtors found that 89% of metro areas saw an increase in the cost of a single-family home in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThat\u2019s partly due toelevated mortgage ratesandchronic underbuildingand potentially worsened by extreme weather events such as wildfires and floods as well as policies that threaten tohike costs of critical homebuilding materials.\nIt\u2019s getting to the point where a new car could cost someone $50,000.\nIn January, Americans paid a whopping $48,100 on average for a new car, jumping about $10,000 from pre-pandemic times. That means new car prices have risen much faster than most goods and services.\nVehicle prices soared in 2021 amid fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and its jumbling of global supply chains. In their case, the semiconductor chip shortage (a result of manufacturers reassigning capacity to consumer techbecause the auto factories shuttered amid the pandemic and lower demand) led tolimited productionof enough cars to meet the sharp rebound in consumer demand.\nThe costlier cars \u2014 new and used \u2014 have come with heftier monthly payments, which have become harder and harder for people to afford.\nUnfortunately, it could get worse: Tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports could quickly send car prices soaring, even for those assembled in the United States.\nThe cost of producing cars throughout North America will rise between $3,500 and $12,000, according to analysis of both public and private data by the Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based think tank.\nCNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya, John Towfighi, Chris Isidore and Bryan Mena contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/04\/business\/economy-state-outlook-dg","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"This could be the most consequential week for the economy in years","date":"2025-07-27","body":"The state of President Donald Trump\u2019s economy is about to come into full view.\nA slew of crucial economic data is set for release this week, including the jobs report, inflation, consumer confidence and corporate earnings. We\u2019ll get the first glimpse at America\u2019s second-quarter gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy. And, most crucially, the Federal Reserve will decide whether to cut rates or hold steady one more time.\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, Trump\u2019s trade polices also come due: Friday is the administration\u2019s self-imposed deadline for settling tariff rates for all 200+ US trading partners. Trump\u2019s top economic advisers will be negotiating a trade framework with China in Sweden. And an appeals court will hear arguments this week about whether the bulk of Trump\u2019s tariffs are even legal, to begin with.\nAltogether, the data could paint a picture of an economy that is resilient \u2014 but slowing under the weight of Trump\u2019s dizzying tariff changes, reductions in government workers and spending, and an aggressive deportation of foreign-born workers.\nHere\u2019s a look at what to expect this week and why the data matters:\nSome of the biggest names in tech are set to release earnings this week, including Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Apple. That will set the tone for market sentiment.\nTech stocks have fueled record market growth in recent months as investors focus on gearing up for AI expansion. So far, around 80% of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings this season have beaten estimates, according to FactSet.\nOverall, stocks have marched higher into record territory recently, supported by cautious optimism in trade deals and better-than-expected economic data. That has emboldened Trump to push harder on his trade deals, telling NBC News earlier this month that markets hit new highs because \u201ctariffs have been very well received.\u201d\nWhy it matters:Strong earnings could continue to boost the stock market, which is starting to look a bit expensive for some investors. That could also convince Trump that the market \u2014 which turned on him in April \u2014 has acquiesced to his plan for higher tariffs.\nTwo separate reads on the way Americans are feeling about the economy are set to be released this week.\nConsumer confidence, as measured by Conference Board, sank to the lowest level since the pandemic when Trump slapped massive tariffs on major trading partners. Shoppers expressed concern about the negative impact on the economy and prices. But consumers are generally more optimistic now that trade deals are beginning to emerge.\nThe consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan continues to show that shoppers are wary of inflation levels rising again, after the economy batted down historic price increases following the pandemic. Although sentiment has rallied back from near-record lows earlier this year, it remains depressed because of Trump\u2019s trade policy.\nWhy it matters:Economists pay close attention to consumers\u2019 optimism, since their spending powers two-thirds of the economy \u2014 and when shoppers think prices are about to rise, they tend to pull back. The latest retail sales data shows that consumersare spending cautiously.\nGDP is a key indicator of economic success and, arguably, a validation of Trump\u2019s policies. But this quarterly assessment has slumped in recent months, evenshrinking in the first quarter of the yearfor the first time since 2022.\nEconomists expect an improvement for the April-June quarter as imports rebalance after companies raced to front-load their purchases ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs. They warn that, just as an inventory spike may have artificially hurt GDP in the first quarter, companies working through their warehoused goods in the second quarter may make the economy look better than it actually is.\nWhy it matters:The US economy is large and resilient, and it has continued to support hundreds of thousands new jobs each month for years. But if Americans are getting cold feet, things could take a turn for the worse.\nTrump has repeatedly \u2014 and publicly \u2014 berated Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering the bank\u2019s interest rate (their recent d\u00e9tentenotwithstanding), but the central bank is overwhelmingly expected to hold rates steady Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting.\nIn an unusual kink, two governors are expected tovote against the consensusof the board, which hasn\u2019t happened in three decades. With the job market still relatively strong, most Fed officials have said the economy can withstand higher rates for the time being. Meanwhile, they want to wait to see how Trump\u2019s policies of high tariffs and deportation of foreign workers impact inflation and the labor market.\nWhy it matters:The bank is widely expected to start cutting its key overnight lending rate in September \u2014 a good sign for Americans hoping to borrow money, and especially for first-time homebuyers, who have been effectively locked out of the market with mortgage rates close to 7%.\nThe Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, has been creeping higher \u2014 moving further away from its 2% goal in recent months. That\u2019s just one factor behind the central bank\u2019s position on rate cuts.\nWhy it matters:Shoppers have been pulling forward purchases, includingback-to-school items, to mitigate expected higher prices, but the July data will likely still bear the fingerprints of Trump\u2019s tumultuous trade policy: Items like furniture and toys are starting to reflect elevated costs as pre-tariff inventory is depleted.\nTrump\u2019s pause on the hefty and unpopular tariffs he rolled out in April expires on August 1. In the intervening period, the White House hasscrambled to make dealswith a slew of partners, announcing preliminary arrangements with the UK, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan. And on Sunday,Trump announced a framework for an EU deal.\nAs the final deadline approaches, Trump said Friday he would be sending out letters to roughly 200 countries this week unilaterally setting a range of tariff rates. \u201cIt\u2019s basically going to say, you\u2019re going to pay 10%, you\u2019re going to pay 15%, you\u2019re going to pay maybe less, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump told reporters before he left for a trip to Scotland.\nUS markets are \u201cvery, very fixated\u201d on the levels that are set, and an effective tariff rate beyond 20% on major trading partners could trigger a downturn on Wall Street,one analyst told CNN.\nWhy it matters:Trump\u2019s tariffs that are currently in effect have raised the effective US tariff rate \u2014 the average tax that US importers pay on foreign goods \u2014 from around 2% to 18%, the highest since 1934, economists atYale\u2019s Budget Labsaid in a recent report. That works out to $2,400 a year in added costs for the average American household. The US economy and markets have been able to withstand that so far. A considerably higher tariff rate could put that to the test.\nTalks with China are ongoing, however. Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentis set to meet Monday and Tuesday with Chinese officials to iron out the details of the framework the two countries agreed upon at their London and Geneva meetings.\nTrump in April slapped a 145% tariff on imports from China, prompting Beijing to respond with a 125% tariff on imports from the United States. That effectively created a total embargo between the world\u2019s two largest economies before they agreed on a pause until August 12.\nMeanwhile, on Thursday, the US Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments about whether Trump can use his emergency powers to levy tariffs after a lower court ruled he had exceeded his authority in doing so.\nWhy it matters:One of the Trump administration\u2019s goals is to shift China towards a more consumer-driven domestic economy, thereby reducing global oversupply of its manufactured goods. While it\u2019s unlikely that the United States will dramatically reshape Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s economic policy, small changes could open some of China\u2019s market to US manufacturers, while helping to increase American factory jobs.\nTrump has promised a \u201cMade in America\u201d revival, but the July jobs report is expected to show that average monthly employment gains have dropped to a level not seen since 2010 (excluding the pandemic-era losses).\nThe labor force has shrunk in recent months, a potential indication of how anti-immigrant rhetoric and mass deportations are weighing on employment.\nIn addition, the most recent report showed that the manufacturing sectorlost jobs for the second-straight month\u2014 a murky development for one of Trump\u2019s benchmark economic priorities.\nWhy it matters:America\u2019s labor market has been its strong suit for years, routinely defying expectations since the pandemic. But it\u2019s showing cracks. Americans who lose their job are now staying unemployed for longer as businesses stall on making decisions, including hiring, as the trade war continues to raise costs.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/27\/economy\/economy-trump-trade-fed-earnings","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"America\u2019s economy performed slightly better in the first quarter than we thought \u2014 but it still shrank","date":"2025-05-29","body":"The US economy shrank slightly less in the beginning of the year than previously reported, new data shows, but it was still the first quarterly decline since 2022, in a sign of how President Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic and aggressive tariff regime is affecting American consumers and businesses.\nGross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered an annualized rate of -0.2% in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department\u2019s second estimate released Thursday. An initial estimate showed that GDP fell 0.3%.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs have prompted American companies and consumers to pull forward purchases to get ahead of any sticker shock stemming from the duties, which has sent imports surging. But a federal court\u2019s ruling late Wednesdayhas thrown Trump\u2019s entire trade policy into question.\nStill, Trump\u2019s trade war is far from over. His administration appealed Wednesday\u2019s ruling from the three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade in Manhattan. Uncertainty stemming from Trump\u2019s policies is expected to persist, but there are also questions over the underlying health of the US economy.\nThe latest GDP data isn\u2019t quelling those fears: A key gauge of demand in the economy \u2014 referred to as real final sales to private domestic purchasers \u2014 was revised down by a sizable half percentage-point for the first quarter. Consumer spending, the lifeblood of the US economy, was also revised lower, factoring in weaker spending on food, cars and financial services.\nAn upward revision to private inventory investment \u2014 specifically by nondurable goods manufacturers and companies in the information industry \u2014 offset those new weaker figures.\nAmericans remain uneasy over the chaotic and erratic rollout of Trump\u2019s tariffs, but the jury is still out on whether consumers will continue to spend, or tighten their belt.\nIn recent years, pessimism about the economy hasn\u2019t led to weaker spending, as happened in 2022 and 2023, when consumers fretted over high inflation and a standoff in Congress about the debt ceiling. The latest consumer surveys show that people\u2019s attitudes toward the economyremain in the doldrums.\nThe strength of consumer spending is closely tied to the health of the labor market. Top policymakers at the Federal Reservefear unemployment could soon pick up, especially if Trump\u2019s trade war spirals out of control.\nFed officials \u201cassessed that there was a risk that the labor market would weaken in coming months,\u201d according to minutes from the central bank\u2019s policy meeting earlier this month, with some noting that \u201ctheir contacts and business survey respondents reported limiting or pausing hiring because of elevated uncertainty.\u201d\nRelated articleFed expects the job market \u2018to weaken substantially\u2019 on Trump\u2019s tariffs\nSo far, therehaven\u2019t been any cracks in America\u2019s long-robust labor market, with employers continuing to add jobs at a brisk pace and unemployment remaining relatively low.\nBut if the labor market does deteriorate, that won\u2019t bode well for consumer spending, which powers two-thirds of the US economy. And Americans stretching themselves to pull forward purchases to beat Trump\u2019s tariffs means the economy would be in a vulnerable position if the job market ever begins to falter.\n\u201cIf you think appliance and vehicle prices are going to rise, you might accelerate your plans, but if you don\u2019t have the cash for these purchases, relying on credit could be risky during uncertain times,\u201d Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said in an analyst note Thursday.\n\u201cNewly delinquent credit accounts are on the rise, so in addition to anticipating the effects of new economic policies on prices, we\u2019ll want to keep an eye on the potential impact to household debt management,\u201d she said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/29\/economy\/us-economy-gdp-q1-revision","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The US economy just had another robust year","date":"2025-01-30","body":"Another year of robust economic growth is in the books, underscoring howthe Biden administration handed President Donald Trumpwhat many considera solid economy.\nThe US economy grew 2.5% over the past year, according to new Commerce Department figures released Thursday, comparing the fourth quarter in 2024 with the one from a year earlier. A resilient labor market supported strong consumer spending last year. Americans\u2019 spending accounts for about 70% of the US economy. Business investment also fueled growth in 2024, though it went into reverse in the final months of the year.\nThe economy expanded at an annualized rate of 2.3% in the fourth quarter, as measured by gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output. That was slightly below economists\u2019 expectations of a 2.4% rate, according to FactSet. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation.\n\u201cFourth-quarter GDP data capped off a surprisingly strong year in 2024,\u201d Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in commentary issued Thursday. \u201cThe US consumer has been unstoppable, supported by wealth creation, a strong labor market, and lending.\u201d\nRelated articleKey takeaways from the Fed\u2019s decision to pause interest rate cuts\nThe latest GDP report comes on the heels of the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy decision announced Wednesday. The central bank opted tohold its key interest rate steady, following three back-to-back rate cuts last year.\nWhile Fed officials seem inclined to hold off on further rate cuts for the next few months, Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his post-meeting news conference said the US economy remains in a good place, with a steady labor market and inflation that seems on track to slow further. He also noted that the strong numbers in the aggregate are masking some economic pain under the surface.\nEconomists broadly expect the US economy to continue with its expansion in 2025, but the one wild card is the economic effect of Trump\u2019s policies, which include mass deportations, stiff tariffs and making his 2017 tax cuts permanent.\nConsumers stepped up their spending in the October-through-December period, boosting the overall economy in the process.\nConsumer spending accelerated to an annual rate of 4.2% in the fourth quarter, up from the prior quarter\u2019s 3.7%. Spending both on goods and services gained steam that period, especially purchases of durables, which registered a stunning 12.1% rate.\nThe pick-up in spending on durable goods \u2014 products meant to last at least three years such as furniture and cars \u2014 may have been due to shoppersscrambling to get aheadof the stiff tariffs Trump has floated. The president has promised to slap 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada on February 1, a move that could make appliances andcarsmore expensive.\nConsumers may have also been enticed to snap up durables because of lower short-term interest rates.\nHowever, business spending was one big red flag in the latest GDP report.\nNonresidential fixed investment, which captures how much businesses are investing in their operations, contracted at an annual rate of 2.2% in the fourth quarter, down sharply from the 4% gain in the prior three-month period.\n\u201cThe one drag was businesses didn\u2019t invest in inventories as much as expected, which may be a reaction to economic uncertainty surrounding the new presidential administration,\u201d Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a note Thursday.\nTrump is beginning his second term with a US economy that\u2019s in very good shape, but he\u2019s also promised major policy changes.\n\u201cIn terms of the outlook, President Trump is looking to create a low-taxation, light-touch regulatory environment in order to boost growth prospects while implementing tariffs to improve US manufacturing competitiveness and promote reshoring of economic activity,\u201d James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said in a note Thursday. \u201cThis should all be supportive for economic activity, but at the same time there is evidence of a cooling jobs market and nominal income growth is slowing notably.\u201d\nTrump has also kicked off an aggressive crackdown on immigration, which economists say could weigh on growth and put employers who rely on migrant labor in a bind.\nThere aren\u2019t many concerns about economic growth this year, but one fear is that Trump\u2019s \u201cexpansionary\u201d policies, aimed at boosting economic activity, could end up stoking inflation. If that turns out to be the case, not only would it sting everyday Americans who\u2019ve already dealt with years of high inflation, but it could also keep the Fed from cutting rates, and possibly hike them instead.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/30\/economy\/us-economy-gdp-q4","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

The economy was in great shape (with some caveats), but the mood was disproportionately lousy.\nToday, the vibes and the economic data appear to be aligning. Just not in a good way.\nThe vibe check in 2025:\nIn sum:The solid economy that President Donald Trump inherited is beginning to buckle under the weight of his tariff agenda, which has left businesses, consumers and investors paralyzed byuncertainty.\nOf course, Trump is eagerly taking credit for a handful of positive data points whileblaming his predecessorfor, or simplyshrugging at, all the bad news.\nMortgage rates have been steadily coming off their recent highs. Gas pricesremain low, near $3 a gallon on average. Overall inflation, even on eggs, is cooling.\nRelated articleTrump acknowledges \u2018inflation is back\u2019 but blames Biden\nBut when you pull back the curtain just slightly on those stats, the warning lights are flashing red.\nMortgage rates have been trending lower for the past six weeks because they track the 10-year Treasury yield. And that safe-haven asset \u2014 where investors tend to move their money when they see signs of trouble in stocks \u2014 is rather popular right now. (Treasury yields go down when demand goes up.)\nGas prices have fallen about 2% since Trump took office, a fact he was quick to pat himself on the back for Wednesday, as my colleagueChris Isidore wrotelast week.\n\u201cWhen energy comes down, prices are going to be coming down with it,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday. \u201cSo in a very short period of time, we\u2019ve done a very good job.\u201d\nOf course, the reason energy prices are down has nothing to do with his \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d agenda \u2014 oil production in the United States hasn\u2019t risen appreciably since Inauguration Day. The price of oil is coming down because of a supply-and-demand imbalance on a global scale, especially with signs of weaker demand in China.\nAnd yes, inflation is continuing its bumpy descent, according to February\u2019sConsumer Price Indexreport. Any price relief for consumers is welcome news. But think of inflation like a campfire: You want it nice and warm but manageable. Too hot, you\u2019re losing control; too cool, no one\u2019s warm and no one\u2019s eating s\u2019mores.\nRight now, we are burning just slightly too hot at an annualized rate of 2.8%. The Fed is targeting closer to 2%.\nHitting that target without snuffing out the fire is a tricky job under any administration, but it\u2019s especially hard when the White House economic policy shifts by the hour.\nOne of the reasons the Fed has so far managed to bring inflation down steadily, without triggering a recession, is all due to the labor market. As long as Americans have jobs, and feel confident they\u2019ll keep having a job, they\u2019ll keep spending.\nThelatestmonthly jobs report suggested the labor market is still strong.But it didn\u2019t fully capture the recentlayoffs at federal agencies, which have been gutted by Elon Musk. TheADP surveyof private sector payrolls showed that sectors like education and health services, which are especially vulnerable to shifts in government spending, slashed 28,000 jobs last month.\nWhat happens next depends a lot on whether Trump retreats on tariffs.\n\u201cThis is a very resilient economy. It can take a licking and keep on ticking. But it doesn\u2019t like this uncertainty,\u201d David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management,told my colleague Matt Eganlast week. \u201cRight now, a lot of businesspeople are like deer in headlights.

{"title":"America\u2019s economy may actually be even weaker than it appears","date":"2025-05-01","body":"President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff plan was largely expected to impact the US economy\u2019s first-quarter performance as companies loaded up on imported goods ahead of higher levies. But what few failed to anticipate was how much worse off the economy would have appeared without stockpiling.\n\u201cPeople are stockpiling now. That\u2019s helping the economy now \u2014 and then they\u2019re going to spend even less,\u201d said Ryan Young, senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank.\nGDP, or gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, fell to an annualized rate of -0.3% in the first quarter of this year, according to Commerce Department data released Wednesday. That remarkable drop from the prior 2.4% ratepushed stocks lower,ignitedtalk of a recessionand underscored why Americans\u2019 confidence in the economic outlook fell this weekto the lowest level in 13 years.\nThe core of last quarter\u2019s decline was the rush to get ahead of Trump\u2019s forthcoming tariffs. That pushed up goods imports by 51% in the first quarter, the fastest pace since 2020 when the US economy was reopening after Covid-related lockdowns.\nBut, absent that surge in goods, the latest GDP report could have been even uglier.\nTrump made no secret of the fact that he was going to announce higher tariffs for all US trading partners as of April 2, a date he refers to as \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d But the question for businesses and consumers was: How high would those new tariffs be?\nWaiting to find out could be costly. So businesses clamored to stockpile ahead of time and consumers moved up purchases, especially big-ticket items.\nBecause of the way GDP is calculated, increases in imports relative to exports put a drag on the economy. But at the same time, the uptick in imports fed right into a huge increase in business investments. All else being equal, higher investment levels boost GDP. In this case, it wasn\u2019t enough to overcome the negative impact of imports, however.\nThe 22% increase in business investment was enough for White House senior trade adviser Peter Navarro on Wednesday to call the GDP report \u201cthe best negative print I have ever seen in my life.\u201d However, he failed to mention that much of the increase in investment came from businesses buying up inventory.\nThe other factor that prevented GDP from declining further was the 1.8% increase in consumer spending last quarter. But once again, that traces back to pre-tariff moves.\n\u201cStockpiling is making things look better than they actually are,\u201d said Young. \u201cAnd the flip side of that is that it\u2019s going to slow down once that midnight rush is over.\u201d\n\u201cThe second-quarter GDP numbers could be brutal,\u201d he added.\nGregory Daco, chief economist at Ernst & Young, said the data was largely emblematic of \u201can artificial pull-forward in demand \u2014 and what often lies beyond these pull-forward effects is a cliff.\u201d\n\u201cWe may actually see that in the second quarter, consumer spending, activity, business investment and inventories are all major drags on growth,\u201d Daco told CNN.\nSome economists read Wednesday\u2019s GDP report with a slightly more sanguine tone.\n\u201cThis report is almost exactly what an otherwise-healthy economy looks like *anticipating* \u2014 but not yet directly hurt by \u2014 tariffs,\u201d Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University and a former top economist in the Biden White House, said in a post on X.\nBrian Rose, senior US economist at UBS, went further, saying he saw the GDP reading as a sign \u201cthat the underlying business cycle remains healthy.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not overly concerned about the negative GDP print,\u201d he said in a note on Wednesday, pointing to the fact that the US economy contracted in the first quarter of 2022 and quickly pivoted back to growth.\nHowever, this year\u2019s second-quarter GDP report is unlikely to improve as the effects of Trump\u2019s levies \u2014 the highest in the developed world \u2014 become more pronounced, he said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/01\/economy\/us-gdp-economy-weaker-than-it-appears","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

A shortage of affordable loans. And a stressed-out workforce. Small businesses are facing mounting pressure from America\u2019s affordability crisis.\nDoug Scheffel, owner of a family-run ETM Manufacturing in Massachusetts, laid off about a quarter of his employees in April as the Trump administration\u2019s haphazard tariff rollout dented demand for the machine parts and sheet metal his company sells.\n\u201cEveryone is hunkering down and building up cash. It\u2019s never been this bad,\u201d Scheffel told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s very uncertain and impossible to plan in this environment.\u201d\nSmall businesses are the backbone of the US economy, accounting for the vast majority of total businesses in the nation, nearly half of all employees and thebulk of the job growth.\nLike other small businesses, ETM Manufacturing can\u2019t take advantage of growth opportunities because financing is so expensive. The average rate on a new urban small business term loan was over 7% at the end of last year, according to theKansas City Fed, but many small businesses face rates well north of 10%.\n\u201cIt\u2019s infuriating,\u201d Scheffel said.\nHigh prices at the grocery store and elsewhere have left some of ETM\u2019s employees preoccupied with their own finances.\n\u201cMost of our employees are distracted. They\u2019re worried about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their kid,\u201d Scheffel said. \u201cBad stuff happens when they\u2019re not totally focused.\u201d\nScheffel\u2019s employees are hardly alone. About one in four US households areliving paycheck to paycheck, meaning they are spending over 95% of their income on necessities like housing and groceries, according to estimates from Bank of America.\nThe mood among mom-and-pop shops on Main Street is mixed. While small business owners tell CNN they are hopeful about the future and excited about how artificial intelligence can help them, some are concerned about the headaches incurred by the ever-changing trade war and high costs.\nBryan Pate, CEO of San Diego-based PT Motion Works, an exercise equipment company that sells elliptical bikes, GIBBON SlackBoards and Indo Board balance boards, told CNN that his business is struggling to keep up with rapidly rising healthcare costs.\nOver the past two decades, the average cost of single coverage health insurancehas surged by 120%for companies with fewer than 50 employees, according to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), a nonprofit that advocates for small businesses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how much healthcare has gone up,\u201d Pate said, noting this is a big disadvantage small businesses have against large corporations. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfair barrier to hiring.\u201d\nThose healthcare and payroll expenses add to the pressure from the historic tariff hikes under President Donald Trump.\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know what the guy is gonna do. It creates so much anxiety and time-wasting,\u201d Pate said of Trump\u2019s evolving tariff policies.\nTrump has raised tariffs on US imports to an average rate of 16.8%, the highest since 1935, according toestimatesreleased by The Budget Lab at Yale on Monday.\nPate said his businesses have been hammered by tariffs \u2014 including the 20% levy on Taiwan, where its bikes are manufactured.\nIronically, the tariffs are wiping out some US manufacturing jobs.\nPate said his company recently ended contracts with seven assembly workers based in San Diego and now employs workers in Mexico instead. And Pate plans to raise prices on bikes to offset the cost of tariffs but worries that will erode demand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been economically painful, and long-term, if tariffs stay where they are, it\u2019s just not going to work,\u201d he said.\nTroy Rackley, CEO at The Next Level of Performance, a Sarasota, Florida-based water treatment technology company, told CNN on the sidelines of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Summit in Washington he has had to raise prices on some of his products due to US tariffs on imports from Australia and China.\nRackley dismissed the argument that exporting countries are paying US tariffs and hopes theSupreme Court rulesagainst the Trump administration\u2019s use ofemergency powers to justifyits global tariffs.\n\u201cChina, Mexico and Canada don\u2019t pay. I\u2019m the one that\u2019s paying for it,\u201d Rackley said. \u201cI pay taxes on my income, and now I have to pay additional taxes on what I bring in.\u201d\nKhari Parker, a graduate of the Goldman Sachs small business program and co-founder of Connie\u2019s Chicken and Waffles in Baltimore, isn\u2019t facing any tariff trouble, but he\u2019s struggling to find affordable capital.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve being hit with very, very high rates of 20% to 30%,\u201d Parker said.\nThe Trump administration has worked to support small businesses by providing capital through the Small Business Administration (SBA).\nSince Trump took office, the SBAestimatesit has approved more than 58,000 small business loans worth over $32 billion. For fiscal 2025, which closed at the end of September, the SBA said it guaranteed a record-setting $44.8 billion of small business loans.\nSmall businessoptimism increasedsharply after Trump took office before retreating after Trump\u2019s tariff plans spooked financial markets, according to the NFIB. Optimism later recovered and is currently slightly above its 52-year average.\nOne recurring struggle for small businesses like Parker\u2019s: attracting talent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to find workers. We can\u2019t always offer the same competitive benefits or pay that larger businesses can,\u201d Parker said.\nFor some companies in construction, those challenges have been amplified by the immigration crackdown.\n\u201cA lot of the workforce is nervous from all the stuff going on with immigration,\u201d said Antonio McMillion, president of Maryland-based developer MFP Management & Construction.\nMcMillion said his company has been forced to hire more expensive workers, raising their labor costs on some projects by up to 40%.\n\u201cHopefully we can pass on the price to the client, but that could also mean you don\u2019t get the job,\u201d he said.\nPate, the CEO of PT Motion Works, is very frustrated by tariffs but remains optimistic about the future because of his employees\u2019 resilience in the face of uncertainty.\n\u201cIt could be very depressing and demoralizing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut no one is throwing in the towel.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/18\/business\/prices-economy-tariff-small-business","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Worried about money? Experts share how to prepare for hard times","date":"2025-08-04","body":"Money stress exists at all socioeconomic levels. It causes prolonged and serious fights in relationships, is linked toinsomniaandstomach ulcers, and acts as amajor stressorfor most Americans, according to Dr. Megan McCoy, a financial therapist and associate professor at Kansas State University.\nAnd with the uncertainty surrounding theimpacts of tariffson prices and ajob marketthat seems to be running out of steam, it makes sense that financial panic may be especially high and emotional well-being particularly low.\nThe best time to make financial decisions is before you are in a bad situation, when you can look at your priorities, needs and realities and build a plan that is realistic and resilient, added Elizabeth Husserl, a financial adviser and wealth manager in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\u201cWe\u2019re holding our breath for something bad to happen tomorrow,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cI hope readers recognize that if they are one of us who are holding their breath, first of all, it\u2019s normal and valid because so many other people are feeling that way, and also to take a deep breath and try to figure out how to focus more on their current situation rather than what may happen.\u201d\nShawna Humbert promised herself that she was never going to live like she did as a kid, fearing the electricity would be cut off when the bill wasn\u2019t paid.\nBut in 2018, she had left her job at a bank to join the police academy before deciding a law enforcement career wasn\u2019t for her. She went from bringing in thousands of dollars a month to nothing, and growing up without financial literacy in her family, she had nothing saved, she said.\nAnd as she worried over whether she could afford to turn on the air-conditioning or go out with her friends, she felt just like that little girl again, Humbert said.\nThe heartache, fear and uncertainty that Humbert faced isn\u2019t unusual when it comes to money.\nOf course, money is emotional. Your financial status influences your access to needs such as clothing, food, shelter and medicine and can be a resource for emotional needs such as belonging, pleasure and rest, Husserl said.\nOne problem is the scarcity mindset, or a belief that resources are limited. It\u2019s particularly hard to make sound financial decisions that can help you get your needs met down the road when you are in the fear or panic mode, McCoy said.\nLife lessons from 6 money and lifestyle coaches\n\u201cThe scarcity mindset makes us more hyperfocused on immediate needs, and it makes it harder to think about the long-term goals,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get this tunnel vision of avoiding the scarcity we once experienced, causing a lot of reactive behavior, because we\u2019re just trying to make sure now we\u2019re OK.\u201d\nThis way of thinking also carries a lot of shame, McCoy said.\n\u201cFear and shame are terrible financial advisers. Emotional clarity leads to financial clarity,\u201d added Husserl, author of \u201cThe Power of Enough: Finding Joy in Your Relationship With Money.\u201d\nBefore making any money decisions, it\u2019s essential to address the emotional side first, she said.\nYou, and your partner if you have one, can sit down and write out your \u201cmoney story,\u201d Husserl said. What are the major experiences you had around money growing up? How does that impact the way you approach your financial life now?\nAnd when you start to feel panic creep up, figure out which emotions are underneath that \u2013\u2013 and don\u2019t be afraid to sit with those feelings and really recognize what fears you are holding onto, McCoy said.\nIt may feel like you need to make a change in response to the uncomfortable feelings, but you are often better served waiting until you have worked through the feelings and can make decisions from a more even-keeled state of mind, she added.\nPeople often hear the word budget and think of dieting \u2013\u2013 punishment, restriction and merciless cost cutting.\nInstead, Husserl recommends a spending plan that focuses on building your financial resilience in both easy and difficult times.\nWhen building your budget or spending plan, start on the emotional side of things once again, said Dr. Sonya Lutter, professor of practice and director of financial health and wellness at Texas Tech University.\nWhat are the three to five things that are most important to you? Do your top priorities include family, health, novelty or security? Once you know what matters to you, you can look at how you are already spending your money and see whether there are ways you can align the two, she said.\nTransform your anxiety into something useful. Here\u2019s how\nPart of building resilience also means looking at which parts of your spending can be turned up or down depending on your financial situation of the moment and which are valuable enough to remain consistent, Husserl said.\nFor example, she and her family members know that when things are more comfortable financially, they might spend more on entertainment subscriptions or takeout to add a little ease and enjoyment into their day. But if money is tighter, they find shows together on one streaming service or make meal plans for the week, she said.\nOn the other hand, Zumba classes keep enjoyable exercise a regular part of her life, so she works harder to retainthat as a line item of her spending plan regardless, Husserl added.\nMoney can be an effective way to get one\u2019s needs met, but it\u2019s helpful to diversify how you find feelings of satisfaction, McCoy said.\nCould making food at home give you a sense of satisfaction that\u2019s similar to going out for a nice meal? Would longer hugs with your spouse provide the comforting touch you experience when paying for a massage? Creature comforts are still important, but find many ways to meet those needs so that you don\u2019t feel too tied to your spending habits, she said.\nA scarcity mindset also makes it hard to take things step-by-step, which is crucial to making big and sustainable financial changes, McCoy said.\nFor her, a six-figure student debt felt impossible to look at as monthly payments, she said. Instead, everything she did was under this dark cloud of an impossibly large number.\nUsually, she would be left feeling guilty and overwhelmed, McCoy added.\nInstead, small and manageable steps that she built over time helped her feel more empowered and motivated.\nSeattle-based money expert Tori Dunlap recommends setting a regular \u201cmoney date,\u201d or a scheduled check-in that you enjoy \u2014 maybe light your favorite candle or make yourself a delicious drink before you settle in.\nGo over where you are financially, automate your savings or bill payments, and take some small steps by canceling a subscription or just texting a friend to let them know you are having a hard time, she added.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been taught to carry shame around our finances, especially as women. But shame is not a financial strategy,\u201d Dunlap said in an email. \u201cThe more we normalize these conversations, the easier it becomes to move forward \u2014 even when things feel hard.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to think that you are the only one struggling financially or that those in your community have so much more than you do, but starting the conversation with those you trust may show you that most people are facing similar stressors and constraints, Lutter said.\n\u201cFinancial stress thrives in isolation, and building community around these conversations is half the battle,\u201d said Dunlap, author of \u201cFinancial Feminist: Overcome the Patriarchy\u2019s Bullsh*t to Master Your Money and Build a Life You Love.\u201d\nA lot of financial stress comes from knowing that big changes can happen unexpectedly, and an emergency fund is a great place to start in relieving that fear.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be financial emergencies, and by definition, we don\u2019t know when they\u2019re coming,\u201d Lutter said.\nEverything is getting more expensive, job losses happen, your air-conditioning could break \u2013\u2013 and compounding interest is great for saving but can also pull people into a hole when it comes to debt, she added.\nThat\u2019s where the emergency fund comes in.\n\u201cAim for three to six months of living expenses if you can, but don\u2019t get discouraged if you\u2019re not there yet.

{"title":"Invest in crypto? Here\u2019s what to know about your 2025 taxes","date":"2025-11-14","body":"When it comes to voluntarily paying taxes on time to the IRS, crypto investors may not have a great record. At least, not according to an IRS review from 2023, which showed \u201cthe potential for\u201d a mere 25% compliance rate.\nTranslation: Only about a quarter of crypto investors are likely voluntarily complying with their tax obligations.\nBut that low rate is likely to rise, because 2025 is the first year that investors with accounts on centralized crypto exchanges are subject to third-party reporting.\nIf you sold or exchanged crypto this year and conducted those transactions on a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, the exchange is now required to report your sales and exchanges to the IRS onForm 1099-DA(Digital Assets). You\u2019ll get a copy too, and it should be sent to you byFebruary 17, 2026in time for you to file your 2025 tax return.\nTo be clear, that reporting does not create any new tax obligations for you. But it will make it easier for the IRS to know if you\u2019re shirking them.\nHow? If what you report on your return doesn\u2019t match what appears on the 1099-DA form sent to the IRS, itsAutomated Underreportersystem may flag the discrepancy and send you a notice to correct the mismatch, said Shehan Chandrasekera,head of tax strategy atCoinTracker, a provider of crypto tracking technology.\nBut there is something in it for you, too.\n\u201cThe 1099, while it increases compliance, also makes life a lot easier for those who need to report on their investments,\u201d said Tomer Siegal, vice president of product at Ledgible, a crypto tax software provider.\nThere are, however, some important exceptions of certain crypto transactions thatdo nothave to bereported on the 1099-DA, but which you will still need to report on your 2025 tax return next year.\nCost basis:For 2025, centralized exchanges are only required to report the gross proceeds of your crypto sales on the 1099-DA,notthe cost basis, Chandrasekera said.\nThe cost basis is what you will need to calculate to determine what your capital gains and losses are.\nStarting in 2026, however, exchanges will have to start reporting cost basis. But only for securities purchased on or after January 1, 2026 and only if the purchase and subsequent sale took place on the same exchange, and the asset was held by the exchange the whole time\ufeff, Siegal said. \u201cNo transfers can occur.\u201d\nIf you do get a 1099-DA with gross proceeds, given that it\u2019s the inaugural year of the reporting requirement, \u201ccheck that (your crypto exchange) reported it correctly,\u201d Siegal said.\nStablecoin, NFTs and wrapped tokens:Centralized exchanges issuing 1099-DAs do not have to report any qualified stablecoin sales you made under $10,000, nor any sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) below $600, nor transactions involving the transfers of wrapped tokens (which allow for easy use of one form of crypto \u2014 eg, bitcoin \u2014 on a decentralized platform that is based on another form \u2014 eg, Ethereum), Chandrasekera said.\nYou, however, are still obligated to report them on your tax return.\nCrypto ETFs:Siegal noted that if you sold shares in an SEC-regulated bitcoin or ethereum exchange-traded fund this year, those transactions will be subject to third-party reporting. But they will appear on aForm 1099-B\u2013 the same form used for any of your sales through a broker involving stocks, bonds or derivatives.\nIf you engaged in transactions this year over decentralized exchanges \u2013 which allow for peer-to-peer trading of crypto and you, not the platform itself, maintains possession of your holdings \u2013 you will not get a 1099-DA from those platforms. What\u2019s more, a requirement that they begin issuing those forms in 2027 was repealed earlier this year.\nNevertheless, you are still obligated to report your taxable defi transactions on your tax return.\nDespite the different reporting requirements for your SEC-regulated assets like stocks versus assets on a crypto exchange, the tax treatment of your capital gains and losses are the same.\nNamely, that your losses can offset your gains. And if you have more losses than gains, you also may use them as a deduction for up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in any given tax year. Any losses in excess of all that may be carried forward to apply to gains in future tax years.\nSo, as an oversimplified example: If in 2025 you realized $15,000 in capital losses (meaning you sold your assets for less than you bought them) and you had $8,000 in gains, you can use $8,000 of your losses to cancel out any tax you owe on your gains plus you may use another $3,000 of your losses as a deduction on your 2025 ordinary income (eg, salary and bank interest). Plus, you still will have $4,000 in losses that may be used in future tax years.\nIt\u2019s important to know, too, that you can use your losses in one asset class (eg, stocks) to offset your gains in another (eg, crypto), Chandrasekera said.\nCorrection:The original story incorrectly stated the purchase date for crypto securities whose cost basis must be reported to centralized exchanges, starting in 2026; and the date by which investors should receive 1099-DA forms.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/14\/business\/taxes-crypto-irs-form-1099-da","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"US economy goes into reverse from Trump\u2019s abrupt policy shifts","date":"2025-04-30","body":"The US economy justhad its worst quarter since 2022 as President Donald Trump\u2019s significant policy changes unnerved consumers and businesses.\nGross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered at an annualized rate of -0.3% in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.\nThat\u2019s a sharp slowdown from the fourth quarter\u2019s 2.4% rate, and much worse than the 0.8% rate economists projected. GDP is adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation.\nUS stocks dropped after the GDP report was released.\nThe Trump administration has been ona chaotic tariff spreeover the past several months, escalatingtrade tensions with Chinaandunsettling Americans. Most economists say Trump\u2019s monumental bid to reshape global trade is likely to send inflation climbing in the United States and even trigger a recession.\nThe president, however, deflected blame from the weak figures reflected in the first economic report card of his second term.\n\u201cOur Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden \u2018Overhang.\u2019\u201d he wrote Wednesday in a post on social media. \u201cThis will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!\u201d\nDuring a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Trump reiterated that stance: \u201cThat\u2019s Biden, that\u2019s not Trump.\u201d\nThe economy\u2019s decline in the beginning of the year was driven by a wider trade deficit \u2014 a result of Americans front-running purchases to beat Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 and cutbacks in government spending, according to a release. Imports skyrocketed from -1.9% in the fourth quarter to 41.3% in the first three months of the year. Meanwhile, exports registered at a 1.8% rate.\nWhen imports exceed exports, that subtracts from GDP and that was by far the biggest drag on growth in the first quarter. The difference between imports and exports subtracted from GDP by the most on records going back to 1947.\nTrump\u2019s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, called the GDP report \u201cthe best negative print I have ever seen in my life.\u201d\n\u201cThe markets need to look beneath the surface,\u201d Navarro said Wednesday in a CNBC interview, pointing to the sharp increase in domestic investment last quarter. However, much of that came from businesses increasing their inventories ahead of tariffs, the Commerce Department said.\nThere were several signs of weakness in the first GDP report of Trump\u2019s second term, but it wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom.\nConsumer spending, which powers about 70% of the US economy, slowed sharply in the first quarter to a 1.8% rate, down considerably from 4% in the prior three-month period. That slowdown was largely due to Americans cutting their spending on goods, and was the weakest rate since mid-2023.\nGovernment spending also weighed on the economy, with federal outlays dropping to -5.1% from 4% during the same period.\nMeanwhile, businesses actually stepped up their spending, likely to get ahead of any expected price increases stemming from Trump\u2019s tariffs. Business investment in the first quarter expanded at a 9.8% rate, up sharply from -3% in the fourth quarter. Gross private domestic investment was 21.9% in the January-through-March period, the highest rate since late 2021.\nStephen Miran, chair of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown that the uptick in business investment is \u201cnot what firms do when they\u2019re concerned about the economic outlook.\u201d\nIn a shred of goods news, final sales to private domestic purchasers \u2014 a key gauge of underlying demand in the economy \u2014 accelerated to 3% in the first quarter from 2.9% in the fourth quarter.\nThe White House pointed to that figure as a sign of \u201cstrong underlying economic momentum that occurred after President Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise the leftovers of Biden\u2019s economic disaster have been a drag on economic growth, but the underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering,\u201d Trump\u2019s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement. She added that economic developments over the past few months are \u201cfueling an economic boom and setting the stage for unprecedented growth as President Trump ushers in the new Golden Age.\u201d\nWednesday\u2019s report also showed that inflation took a sharper than expected upswing during the first quarter. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index rose an estimated 3.6% for the quarter, up from 2.4% during the fourth quarter, according to the report. Excluding food and energy prices, the core PCE index increased 3.5% versus 2.6% the quarter before.\nWhile the latest GDP report points to a much weaker economy compared to last year, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Americans are in the throes of a recession just yet.\nA recession is technically defined as a broad-based contraction in the economy \u2014 encompassing the labor market, consumer spending, industrial activity and business investment \u2014 that lasts for more than a few months. And even though it may feel like there is a recession,according to polls and surveys, the economy remains in good shape on a few important fronts.\nRelated articleAmericans fear an imminent recession. That may be enough to put us in one\nUnemployment remains relatively low \u2014 4.2% as of March \u2014 businesses are continuing to invest in their operations and consumers haven\u2019t retreated with their spending in any meaningful way just yet, government data shows.\nStill, the economy can quickly take a turn for the worse, especially if Trump ups the ante on his tariff blitz.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can call a recession from this data right now but it is a sign that we\u2019re on this razor-thin edge where the longer the tariffs remain in place the more likely we are headed for an economic downturn,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at Ernst & Young, told CNN\u2019s Matt Egan.\nA separate report released Wednesday showed a precipitous drop-off in hiring by businesses in the US private sector, which doesn\u2019t bode well for economic growth in the future.\nEmployers added just 62,000 jobs in April, according to payroll company ADP\u2019s latest monthly report released Wednesday morning.

{"title":"New tax law increases big beyond-the-grave tax break for the wealthy","date":"2025-07-20","body":"The US federal estate tax has come a long way since 2000, when the exemption level was set at $675,000.\nThe amount has increased greatly over the past quarter century. Americans who die in 2025 may leave behind tax free to their heirs up to $13.99 million.\nThat exemption level had been set to expire after this year and snap back to a little more than $7 million per person.\nBut that won\u2019t happen. Instead, starting in 2026, the exemption level will increase by roughly 7.2% to $15 million and adjust for inflation every year thereafter.\nThat\u2019s courtesy of the One Big Beautiful Act that Republicans pushed through in time for President Donald Trump to sign it into law on his self-appointed deadline of July 4.\nRelated articleHere\u2019s how Trump\u2019s megabill will affect you\nKeep in mind, while not new, the exemption level is effectively doubled for married couples. That\u2019s because any unused exemption from the first spouse who dies can be passed to the surviving spouse, and the decedent\u2019s estate can pass to the widow or widower tax free. Then, when they die, they will get up to two times the individual exemption level. So that comes to $27.98 million tax free for couples this year and $30 million next year.\n(It\u2019s also worth noting that the estate tax exemption level is the same as the lifetime gift tax exemption level. That means essentially how much you\u2019re allowed to exempt from estate taxes at death is reduced by how much you gave away in gifts while you were alive.)\nTheOBBAdid not change the federal tax rates imposed on the taxable portion of estates. They\u2019re set on agraduated scale, from 18% to 40%with the initial portion above the exemption level taxed at 18%, the next portion at 20% and so on up to 40%, which is well below the 55% top rate that applied in 2001.\nRaising the exemption level to $15 million a person is likely to further reduce the already low share of estates subject to the estate tax. In 2001, roughly 2.1% of Americans who died left behind taxable estates \u2014 and that number dropped to just 0.07% in 2019, according to the Congressional Research Service. That share was expected to rise to 0.2% in 2026, had the exemption level snapped back to roughly $7 million as was scheduled.\nDespite those very tiny percentages, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the OBBA change will reduce federal revenue by nearly $212 billion over the next decade relative to what the law had called for before OBBA was enacted.\nEven if your estate or that of a loved one falls well below the federal exemption level, the estate may still be considered taxable in the state where a decedent was living when they died.\nRelated articleWho will \u2014 and won\u2019t \u2014 benefit from the bigger SALT deduction\nAs of this year, 12 states and the District of Columbia have an estate tax, according to the Tax Foundation. The states are: Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\nThe exemption levels and the tax rates imposed vary from state to state. In Massachusetts, for example, the exemption level is $2 million, and depending how much more an estate is worth above that threshold, it may be subject to a tax rate between 0.8% and 16%. In Washington, up to $3 million may be exempt from the state estate tax but rates run as high as 35% on the taxable portion of an estate.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/20\/business\/new-tax-law-increases-federal-estate-tax-exemption","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Are tariffs a tax? The court\u2019s view may decide the fate of Trump\u2019s tariff battle","date":"2025-11-11","body":"A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nIn a case where Chief Justice John Roberts stares down a president\u2019s signature agenda item, the decisions can hinge on what Roberts sees as a tax.\nThat\u2019s what happened with the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, whenRoberts shocked conservatives and Republicansby upholding the law and its since-repealed requirement that people must pay a fine, or a tax, if they did not buy health insurance.\nNow Roberts is faced with Trump\u2019s tariffs, which are obviously a tax, but which the president says are a tool.\nUnwinding the tariffs, Trump warned in a wee-hours social media post Tuesday, could cost the government trillions of dollars. It was both an indication of the pressure justices are under with this case and a reminder that Trump unilaterally raised taxes by imposing tariffs.\nHe has also suggested a possible$2,000 rebatefor US taxpayers.\nWhen the Supreme Courtheard oral arguments last weekin a challenge to Trump\u2019s sweeping use of emergency powers to impose taxes on nearly all imports, Roberts\u2019 view of taxes came up.\nI talked to CNN\u2019s Chief Supreme Court Analyst Joan Biskupic about the arguments and how the justices will approach a case that touches nearly the entire US economy and tests the plain language of the Constitution.\nOur conversation, conducted by phone and edited for length and clarity, is below.\nWOLF: The thing that struck me about the oral arguments is that the tariff case could ultimately hinge on whether Chief Justice John Roberts believes tariffs are taxes. It made me think of Obamacare, the law that Roberts saved, in part because he deduced that the individual mandate was a tax. Is that a good way to frame this?\nBISKUPIC:There are some parallels with the two major presidential initiatives, Obama\u2019s in 2012, and Trump\u2019s now. And there are some parallels with the word \u201ctax.\u201d But let me give you some context that will help you decide whether there is more to this case than just saying a tariff could be a tax.\nThere are several cross-currents here, and we\u2019re not sure what will be overriding for the justices. For example, we heard concerns that the president was usurping congressional power. In the opposite direction, we heard concerns about inhibiting the executive\u2019s power over foreign relations.\nWOLF: If Roberts views tariffs as a tax, does that suggest he will oppose Trump\u2019s actions since the Constitution gives Congress the power to tax?\nBISKUPIC:Roberts said plenty during theQ and Asuggesting he does view tariffs as a tax. But that isn\u2019t the end of things. As he said at one point: So the tariffs are a tax and that\u2019s a core power of Congress. But they are, and I\u2019m going to quote him, \u201ca foreign-facing tax.\u201d And he went on to tell the lawyer for the challengers, \u201cForeign affairs is a core power of the executive. And I don\u2019t think you can dismiss the consequences.\u201d\nSo being able to label these tariffs as a kind of tax doesn\u2019t mean they will definitely be struck down. During the Q and A, there was also some question of whether the tariffs could be compared to licenses, which could have more regulatory breadth than a pure income-generating tax.\nWOLF: I was a little surprised there wasn\u2019t more discussion during oral arguments that the Constitution specifically gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs. Why not?\nBISKUPIC:Congress can cede some of that power through legislation. And the question is: Did Congress give certain tariff power to the president in the IEEPA (International Emergency Economic Powers Act)? Usually, tariff authority is specific, carefully delineated by Congress. But the IEEPA doesn\u2019t even mention the word \u201ctariff.\u201d The Trump administration argues that the IEEPA language relating to the \u201cregulation\u201d of \u201cimportation\u201d is broad enough to cover tariffs. Lower courts disagreed.\nWOLF: These tariffs are a major part of Trump\u2019s agenda that he promised during the campaign. The scale of them means they touch much of the US economy. To what extent are the justices likely to be talking about the scale of it, and whether deference should be given to the president because of the election? Are they going to be mindful of the external context?\nBISKUPIC:In some cases, the external becomes the internal. Issues related to executive power weigh especially on this conservative majority. And the court has ruled over time, not just in today\u2019s conservative era, that a president has broad authority when it comes to foreign affairs. So that\u2019s in the atmosphere, as well as the fact that this is a signature initiative of the president. Just as was the situation with Obamacare. So whatever the court does will be viewed as either a major stamp of approval or a major rejection.\nAnd I don\u2019t think you can discount that the justices are concerned about whether people have confidence in the court, that it is not simply a tool of the administration.  All these factors make this a very close case.\nI think many of the justices, especially the chief, are mindful that there\u2019s this public narrative that the court is always siding with Donald Trump. Now, they don\u2019t like that narrative. They don\u2019t believe that narrative. But it\u2019s there. I\u2019m not saying these factors would be decisive, but I don\u2019t think we can discount them.\nWOLF: Justices have talked about their concerns over safety. Do you think that they are afraid or intimidated at the thought of crossing Trump in a big way?\nBISKUPIC:No. I don\u2019t think so. Just to break down the nine: I think we\u2019ve got three justices who are going to be with him on this tariff dispute: Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh. Solidly against him on this issue seem to be Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. In the middle would be the chief and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. I don\u2019t think any of the three worry about crossing Trump, as you put it. And you mentioned safety. I\u2019d say that is a general concern across the judiciary, but these justices have full-time security. Frankly, it\u2019s the lower-court judges who have more real fears about safety. They\u2019re on the front lines and unaccustomed to being so much in the public eye.\nAnd I do not think any of the justices feel like they can\u2019t vote a certain way because they\u2019re going to draw out President Trump\u2019s wrath. In many cases, they\u2019re with him anyway. That\u2019s the bottom line for this conservative supermajority court. They are very much aligned with Donald Trump on the law.\nWOLF: What are you expecting from the decision?\nBISKUPIC:I think the chief, with a case of this magnitude, will want to write the court\u2019s opinion. Going into the case, the momentum was with the challengers because of how lower courts ruled. And maybe the justices are going that way, too. But remember we saw only a glimpse of their views in oral arguments. They\u2019ve taken a private vote by now and are beginning negotiations that will take months. As I said, there are cross-currents here. I don\u2019t necessarily think votes will shift. But with Obamacare, the chief made multiple vote switches. So it ain\u2019t over till it\u2019s over.\nWOLF: Why did he change at the last minute?\nBISKUPIC:In the beginning, he was with fellow conservatives to strike Obamacare down under the Commerce Clause. But then he decided he could uphold it under Congress\u2019 taxing power. This is why you made a connection between this case and that one on the word \u201ctax.\u201d\nWOLF: That\u2019s interesting that they have to negotiate with each other to get to something they can all agree on or a majority will agree on.\nBISKUPIC:Exactly. Five votes are needed for a majority, but the chief might want to try for more, with more compromises \u2014 because it is such a big case and so much at stake for President Trump and his agenda.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/11\/politics\/tariffs-trump-supreme-court-roberts-tax-analysis","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"IRS makes changes that will affect your taxes this year and next","date":"2025-10-09","body":"The IRS on Thursday announced adjustments it is making to a host of line items on your federal tax return for this year and next. Those updates are the result of changes in inflation but also due to provisions in thenew tax lawenacted in July.\nHow the adjustments will affect you has everything to do with what deductions you take and what your taxable income will be.\nBut, generally speaking, \u201cmany taxpayers will see modest \u2018relief\u2019 simply because the deductions and thresholds move upward. Inflation will take less of a bite,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Saben, director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Professionals.\nAmong the changes are:\nMost filers claim the standard deduction, and they do so because it exceeds the value of the deductions they would otherwise take if theyitemized.\nThe increases in the standard deduction by 2026 \u201cwill shift more income into the \u2018zero bracket\u2019 \u2014 (meaning it will not) be taxed because the deduction covers more,\u201d O\u2019Saben said.\nWho will \u2014 and won\u2019t \u2014 benefit from the bigger SALT deduction\nFor tax year 2025, returns for which will be due in April of next year, the new tax law raised the standard deduction to$15,750 for single filers, up from the $15,000 that had previously been scheduled. For married couples filing jointly, it will be $31,500, up from $30,000. And for heads of households, their standard deduction will be $23,625, up from $22,500.\nFrom there, for tax year 2026, the IRS is adjusting the standard deduction for inflation \u2014 something it does every year. As a result, the standard will rise to $16,100 for single filers; $32,200 for joint filers; and $24,150 for heads of households.\nThe IRS also made inflation adjustments for 2026 to the income ranges that apply to each of the seven federal income tax rates. As the IRS has explained, \u201cWhen your income jumps to a higher tax bracket, you don\u2019t pay the higher rate on your entire income. You pay the higher rate only on the part that\u2019s in the new tax bracket.\u201d\nThe adjustments are not uniform \u2014 some ranges increased by roughly 3.9% while others increased by about 2.3% relative to this year. \u201cThe uneven increases are normal artifacts of the IRS\u2019s inflation adjustment methodology \u2014 not a policy choice to favor one income level over another,\u201d O\u2019Saben said.\nIn 2026, you will pay:\nThe EITC is an especially valuable credit for low-income households. Credits are a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the taxes you owe. And, since it is a refundable credit, it can increase your refund if you don\u2019t have much or any income tax liability.\nThe IRS is increasing the value of the credit for next year. For instance, eligible tax filers with three or more children may claim a maximum of $8,231, up from $8,046 this year.\n(You can find more informationhereon these and other adjustments the IRS is making for 2026.)","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/09\/business\/irs-inflation-tax-brackets-standard-deduction","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

At current count, all residents and businesses in seven states have already been granted filing and payment extensions, on top of people in select areas of other states. More on that below.\nPlus, millions of individual filers have requested \u2014 or will request today \u2014 automatic six-month filing extensions because they won\u2019t make the April 15 deadline.\nIf you are racing to file your return today \u2014 or think you won\u2019t make it in time \u2014 here are some last-minute tips to keep in mind.\nIf you\u2019re starting cold, make sure you pull together all the documents you\u2019ll need to fill out your return. You\u2019ll want to look for income reporting forms from your employer (aW-2for your earnings) or from your clients if you\u2019reself-employed as a freelancer or contractor(a1099-NECor1099-MISC).\nRelated articleHeads up if you\u2019re a freelancer or small business owner: The IRS may need something new from you\nYou may even get a1099-Kfrom any payment apps you use like Venmo if you received payments for your goods or services. If you are receiving any income distributions from an IRA or pension, you should have a1099-R.\nAlso look for other 1099 forms from your bank and brokerage for other types of income you received during the year (e.g., interest, dividends and capital gains).\nAll these forms will have been sent to you by mail, electronically or both.\nConsider, too, any major changes that took place in your life in 2024 that could affect your taxes either through new tax breaks or new types of reportable income \u2014 for instance, if you got married, had children, received alimony, started a small business on the side, bought or sold a home, inherited an IRA or collected unemployment benefits.\nMost filers now take the standard deduction \u2014 a flat amount you deduct from your income ($14,600 for single filers and those who are married filing separately; $29,200 for married couples filing jointly; and $21,900 for head-of-household filers).\nBut if the standard deduction amounts to less than the total of the value of itemized deductions you\u2019re eligible to take (e.g., state and local taxes, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, etc.) youmight want to itemize.\nIf you do, gather the documentation you will need to back up those deductions (e.g. aForm 1098for mortgage interest from your lender, contribution receipts from charities, etc.).\nSpeaking of deductions, if you qualify to deduct contributions to a traditional tax-deferred IRA, you can put away up to $7,000 ($8,000 if you\u2019re 50 or older) by 11:59 pm on April 15 and still have it count as your 2024 contribution.\nSince it\u2019s an \u201cabove-the-line deduction\u201d you\u2019re allowed to take it even if you claim the standard deduction. Here are the eligibility rules if youhave a retirement plan at workandif you don\u2019t.\nIf you have a fairly straightforward tax situation with a household income below $250,000, and if you take the standard deduction and only a handful of credits pertaining mostly to family, you may be eligible to use theIRS\u2019 free Direct File program. (Here\u2019show to figure out if it would be right for you.)\nThe Direct File option is currently available in 25 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\nThe program works on mobile phones, laptops, tablets or desktop computers. And it will help guide you to fill out your state tax return, too.\nYou also canfile for freeusing one of several private-sector tax preparation softwareprograms approved by the IRS. These free filing options, however, are for those with adjusted gross incomes of $84,000 or less. Other eligibility criteria may apply.\nWhether you\u2019re preparing your return on your own, working with a tax preparer or using Direct File, you always want to double check that everything is correct on your return before submitting it. Dopey little mistakes \u2014 getting a number wrong, misspelling your name, selecting the wrong filing status, etc. \u2014can hold upthe processing of your return. And if you\u2019re due a refund, those errors could delay that money getting to you.\nIf possible, electronically file your return, which is generally considered to be safer and faster, according to theTaxpayer Advocate Service.\nWhile April 15 is the deadline for most US tax filers, there are certain groups of filers whose official due date is later this year, such as people living and working in certainfederally declared disaster areas. This now includes all the residents and businesses operating in seven states:Alabama,Arkansas,Florida,Georgia,North Carolina,South CarolinaandTennessee.

{"title":"Two tax reporting changes on tap for businesses, freelancers and payment apps like Venmo","date":"2025-07-15","body":"\u201cNever mind. Pretend like nothing ever happened.\u201d\nThat might as well have been the text of one provision in President Donald Trump\u2019s megatax-and-spending-cuts packagethat reverses more stringent tax-reporting requirements for payment apps when it comes to telling the IRS how much small businesses and freelancers are taking in via business transactions on their platforms.\nThe package also contains a new measure for all businesses that issue 1099-NEC and 1099-MISC forms to report to the IRS how much non-employee compensation they pay to vendors and contractors. It\u2019s a change that upends decades of practice. But we\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\nThe upshot of both changes is this: The IRS will have much less of a view into how much income small businesses and independent contractors make because there will be much less third-party reporting required under the new law.\nWorth noting, however: Neither of the changes eliminates the requirement for small businesses, freelancers and contractors to accurately report all their earnings to the IRS on their own tax forms.\nFirst, let\u2019s address the \u201cwe\u2019re going right back to the way things were\u201d measure for \u201cthird-party settlement organizations\u201d \u2014 i.e., payment apps like Venmo.\nRelated articleWho will \u2014 and won\u2019t \u2014 benefit from the bigger SALT deduction\nFor many years, those payment platforms only had to issue 1099-K forms to the IRS if a person had conducted more than 200 transactions in the tax year and those transactions combined exceeded $20,000.\nBut lawmakers under the American Rescue Plan Act had lowered that dollar-threshold to $600 and eliminated the number-of-transactions rule altogether \u2014 a change that was supposed to take effect in 2021. It was postponed, however, for a few years and then only partially implemented for tax years 2024 and 2025, when payment apps only had to report a person\u2019s business transactions if they were more than $5,000 in 2024 and more than $2,500 this year.\nWell, forget about all that. The new tax law repeals that revision and reinstates the 200 transactions\/$20,000 threshold rule.\nThe second change upends decades of practice and affects businesses of all kinds, said Wendy Walker, a vice president of regulatory affairs at Sovos, a business compliance software provider.\nUntil now, businesses have been required to issue 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC forms to report to the IRS the non-employee compensation they pay on a one-off basis to independent contractors and vendors throughout the year. Think everyone from the landscaper and cleaning staff to outside legal, accounting or human resource service providers.\nThe new law raises the required reporting threshold from $600 paid for services rendered to $2,000, starting after December 31, 2025. The $2,000 will be adjusted for inflation annually.\n\u201cThat is a huge change,\u201d Walker said. And, she added, \u201cvirtually every business in the US is impacted.\u201d\nThe two changes will result in much less required paperwork for businesses to issue. And they will reduce businesses\u2019 risk of being hit with penalties by the IRS if they file a required form late, file it incorrectly or fail to file it at all, Walker said.\nThe 1099-NEC rule change in particular is likely to offer the most relief to small businesses. Walker noted that plenty of her small business clients have vendors to which they pay less than $2,000 a year, so it could mean up to a 30% reduction in the 1099s they have to issue.\nBoth rule changes also mean freelancers, contractors and vendors will have less third-party recordkeeping to rely on when they do their taxes.\nAnd that lack of reliable third-party records means the IRS \u2014 on behalf of US coffers \u2014 will take in less revenue overall. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the two provisions combined could reduce federal revenue by roughly $13 billion over a decade.\nThat is likely to due to underreporting of income earned. Underreporting of income is a significant contributor to the country\u2019s estimated gross tax gap, which reflects revenue legally owed but not paid voluntarily and on time.\nFor 2022, underreporting accounted for $539 billion of the estimated $696 billion yearly tax gap, according to the IRS.\nThe same report noted that the share of the gross tax gap due to underreporting by individuals was lowest (just 1% \u2014 or $9 billion) among filers whose income is subject to substantial information reporting and tax withholding. Think your basic W-2 employee with a steady paycheck.\nBy contrast, the highest share of the gross tax gap due to underreporting (26% \u2014 or $179 billion) came from those whose income is least likely to be subject to third-party reporting (e.g. freelancers, contractors and sole proprietors).","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/15\/economy\/freelancers-businesses-payment-apps-tax-reporting","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Who will \u2014 and won\u2019t \u2014 benefit from the bigger SALT deduction","date":"2025-07-11","body":"For the next five years, there will be a much more generous state and local tax deduction available to federal income tax filers, thanks to the recently enactedmega tax-and-spending-cuts law.\nThe new law lifts what had been a $10,000 cap to $40,000 for tax year 2025 and then adjusts it upward by 1% a year for 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029.\nThe SALT deduction, as it is known, enables federal income tax filers to deduct either their state and local income taxes or their state and local general sales taxes. On top of that, they are also allowed to deduct their property taxes, assuming their income or sales taxes don\u2019t put them over the cap.\nBut the increased cap may only help a minority of federal income filers.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of who will benefit, who will not \u2014 as well as those who won\u2019t benefit from the change, but are still better off.\nItemizers:The SALT break may only be taken by those who itemize deductions on their federal returns.\nPrior to 2017, there was no cap on the SALT deduction, but the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped it at $10,000 for everyone, while at the same time greatly expanding the standard deduction. Typically, the only reason to itemize your deductions is if, combined, they exceed your standard deduction. The net effect of those two changes together is that far fewer filers chose to itemize, in favor of taking the standard deduction.\nRelated articleHere\u2019s who will \u2014 and won\u2019t \u2014 qualify for the new car loan interest deduction\n\u201cBefore 2017, 80% of my clients would itemize. Now 80% take the standard deduction,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals.\nAs a result of the latest change, O\u2019Saben expects some of his clients to resume itemizing, but not nearly as many as did before 2017. That\u2019s because the new law further expands the standard deduction for 2025 to $15,750 for single filers, up from the $15,000previously scheduledfor this year; $23,625, up from $22,500, for heads of household; and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, up from $30,000. And those amounts will be adjusted for inflation in subsequent years.\nFilers living in high-tax areas: Filers from high-tax states \u2014 such as California, New York and Illinois \u2014 or high-tax cities are likely to benefit most from the SALT cap increase, assuming their income makes them eligible to claim as much as $40,000 (see next item).\nThat\u2019s especially the case for homeowners in these areas, because they are more likely to itemize thanks to the combination of their state and local tax deduction plus their mortgage interest deduction.\nBut even some filers in states that don\u2019t impose an income tax but do levy high sales or property taxes could benefit as well, O\u2019Saben noted.\nFilers making less than $500,000:The new SALT provision limits who may deduct the full $40,000 to tax filers with modified adjusted gross incomes of $500,000 or less. (MAGI in this instance is defined as your US-based income plus any earned income you made in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and foreign countries for which you\u2019d ordinarily get a tax credit or exemption.)\nFilers with MAGIs over $500,000 but less than $600,000:This group will be allowed to take more than a $10,000 deduction but less than the $40,000 cap. Their deduction will be reduced by 30% of the amount their income exceeds $500,000. So for example, if your MAGI is $550,000, you will be allowed to deduct $25,000 ($40,000-30% of $50,000).\nThose with MAGIs of at least $600,000:The SALT deduction will be limited to $10,000 for anyone whose MAGI is $600,000 or more.\nFilers who don\u2019t itemize:Anyone whose itemized deductions \u2014 including the state and local taxes they pay \u2014 do not exceed the standard deduction won\u2019t benefit from the higher SALT cap, but they will still benefit from the higher standard deduction and the fact that taking it will reduce their tax bill more than if they itemized.\nRelated articleHere\u2019s how Trump\u2019s megabill will affect you\nPartners and shareholders in pass-through entities:Partners and shareholders in businesses that are structured as \u201cpass-through entities\u201d (e.g. LLCs or S-Corps) typically pay the businesses\u2019 taxes on their individual returns.\nIf they do, the rules that dictate who may deduct up to $40,000 in state and local taxes would apply to them.\nBut many don\u2019t have to worry about the SALT cap at all. That\u2019s because in the wake of the 2017 tax law, which imposed the $10,000 cap, many states developed a workaround for pass-through entities that allowed (or in some cases mandated) the entities to pay the state taxes,andget an unlimited deduction for them at the entity level. That then lowers the federal taxable income for the partners and shareholders. Those workarounds had the effect of letting the partners or shareholders avoid the SALT cap altogether.\n\u201cTypically the pass-through entity doesn\u2019t pay taxes at all. But in some states passthroughs can elect to be taxed instead,\u201d said Brian Newman, the federal tax services practice leader at CohnReznick Advisory LLC.\nWhile this has complicated pass-through entity taxation, Newman noted, \u201cit\u2019s been a huge benefit for partners and shareholders.\u201d\nEarlier versions of the tax-and-spending-cuts package would have curtailed the benefits of the state workarounds for specified trades and businesses. But the final Senate version, which is what ultimately became law, did not, Newman said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/11\/business\/state-local-tax-deduction-who-benefits","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump says he\u2019ll eliminate income taxes. There\u2019s a problem with that","date":"2025-04-28","body":"President Donald Trump on Sunday night reiterated an extraordinary ambition he and members of his administrationhave voiced from time to timethroughout his young second term: One day, Americans won\u2019t pay any more income tax, and you\u2019ll have Trump\u2019s tariffs to thank for it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make a lot of money, and we\u2019re going to cut taxes for the people of this country,\u201d Trump said before boarding Air Force One for his return from Pope Francis\u2019 funeral in Rome. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a little while before we do that, but we\u2019re going to be cutting taxes, and it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll do a complete tax cut, because I think the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax.\u201d\nNo one likes paying income taxes. But any plan to replace them with tariffs as a source of government revenue would be riddled with problems.\nTo start, tariffs would need to be exceedingly high \u2014 significantly higher than the already historic levels at which the Trump administration has set them today.\nThe federal government raises about $3 trillion a year from income taxes. The United States also happens to import around $3 trillion worth of goods annually. So that means tariffs would have to be at least 100% on all imported goods for the levies to replace income taxes, said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, in a note to investors.\nThe United States\u2019 effective tariff rate now stands at 22.8%, according toFitch Ratings. So to take the place of income taxes, tariffs would need to be more than four times higher than they are now \u2014 and America\u2019s new tariff rate is already by far the highest of any developed country and has threatened to plunge the US and global economies into a recession.\nBut replacing all that tax revenue is not even as simple as doubling the price of everything that comes into America, Slok notes: As prices rise, demand trails off. That\u2019s why America\u2019s largest companies this earnings season have said that Trump\u2019s trade policies are raising costs and leading consumers to spend less on practically everything \u2014 from airline tickets to burritos.\nRelated articleTrump outlines what \u2018total victory\u2019 looks like in his trade war. It\u2019ll cost you\n\u201cThe math just doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation. \u201cNot even close.\u201d\nThe tariffs already imposed and scheduled to take effect will bring in just $170 billion in annual revenue, the Tax Foundation estimates \u2014 taking into account reduced demand for goods that higher prices would create. That\u2019s well short of the amount of federal income taxes America brings in each year.\nSo the government would have to find the right fulcrum point to balance its revenue needs with consumer demand. That could meanmuchhigher prices.\n\u201cThe challenge is that it is unclear what will happen to sales if all imported products double in price,\u201d Slok said. \u201cGiven higher prices result in lower sales, it may require as much as 200% tariffs on all imported goods for the total tariff revenue to replace income taxes.\u201d\nIn other words: To fully replace income taxes, tariffs may need to be set so high that they quadruple the price of everything that comes into the country from abroad.\n\u201cIt\u2019s mathematically impossible to do that, and it\u2019s probably not a good trade for most people,\u201d York said. \u201cThere are versions of this that would make lower- and middle-income households worse off,\u201d because you\u2019d be replacing a progressive income tax with a regressive tariff.\nYet Trump in an interview with Time last week suggested that tariff rates as high as 50% a year from now could be considered a \u201ctotal victory,\u201d because \u201cthe country will be making a fortune.\u201d\nOne obvious problem with Trump\u2019s plan is that it would take an act of Congress to eliminate the federal income tax. Although tax cuts may be on the table, no such bill to eliminate income taxes outright exists, nor does it appear to have broad support, York notes.\nEven if a bill existed and consumers were to accept much higher prices in exchange for zero income taxes, the plan still faces another potential problem: One of Trump\u2019s stated reasons for higher tariffs is to incentivize companies to make stuff in America. If that happensen masse, and imports fall through the floor, where will America\u2019s revenue come from?\nTrump highlighted that problem before boarding Air Force One Sunday. The massive 145% tariff America placed on most Chinese goods is so astronomically high that trade with China has come to a virtual standstill. The means basically no one is paying that tariff \u2014 America isn\u2019t getting any revenue that can replace income taxes.\n\u201cYou know, people talk about going cold turkey with China, just forget about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow they\u2019re not doing any business with us. You know, because, not because of them, because of me, because at 145% you can\u2019t do business.\u201d\nAlthough corporate income taxes may help make up some of the difference in lost revenue, businesses\u2019 income taxes make up just 6% of all US tax revenue compared with 41% from individuals\u2019 income taxes, according to theTax Foundation. And Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate.\nThe notion that tariff revenue could fully replace income taxes isn\u2019t new. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has repeatedly said that was one of the administration\u2019s objectives.\n\u201cDonald Trump announced the External Revenue Service, and his goal is very simple: to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay,\u201d Lutnick told Fox News in an interview in February.\nTrump acknowledged Sunday that income tax elimination is a goal but not necessarily one that could be achieved overnight.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be able to reduce taxes to a very large extent and maybe almost completely,\u201d Trump said.\nThe president said his administration would begin by cutting taxes for people who make less than $200,000 a year.\nBut he acknowledged that tariff revenue would also need to be used for purposes other than replacing income taxes. For example, Trump said tariffs would need to be used to pay down America\u2019s debt, too.\n\u201cNow, we have a lot of debt that\u2019s been left to us, you know, unfortunately, over many years,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of that with the tariffs.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/28\/business\/taxes-trump-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The \u2018revenge tax\u2019 is dead before it even started","date":"2025-06-27","body":"The Treasury Department and Congress on Thursday moved to kill a so-called revenge tax that was set to raise taxes on foreign investment and had spooked Wall Street and global business leaders.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday announced a deal with G7 partners that will exclude US companies from some global taxes in exchange for the US dropping Section 899 from Republican\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act.\u201d\nBessent said in a post on X that he would ask Congress to remove Section 899 from the budget bill. Senator Mike Crapo and Rep. Jason Smith, who co-chair the joint committee on taxation, said in a statement Thursday that following Bessent\u2019s request, they would remove Section 899 from the bill.\nSection 899 was a tax code tucked in to President Donald Trump\u2019s budget bill that would have raised taxes on the income earned from US assets held by individuals or businesses in other countries with taxes the US perceived as unfair for American businesses.\nThe provision would \u201cfacilitate penalty taxes on foreign companies operating in the US if their home country is deemed to have a \u2018discriminatory\u2019 tax system,\u201d analysts at Citi said in a note.\nThe tax code was considered a \u201crevenge\u201d tax because it was designed to retaliate against a global tax framework agreed upon in 2021 by the Biden administration and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer.\nFormer Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had negotiated a tax agreement with other OECD countries that included setting a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Republicans had opposed the agreement and thought it was unfair, arguing it ceded authority on taxation, Luscombe said.\nThe \u201crevenge tax\u201d also was set to retaliate against digital services taxes, or taxes on US tech companies that provide services to users in other countries. Digital services taxes were perceived as \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d by the Trump administration, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.\nTrump had previously signed anexecutive orderon his first day in office announcing that tax deals agreed upon between the Biden administration and the OECD were null. Bessent\u2019s announcement leaves room for how the United States and other countries might negotiate on taxes.\n\u201cThe Trump Administration remains vigilant against all discriminatory and extraterritorial foreign taxes applied against Americans,\u201d Bessent said in his post on X. \u201cWe will defend our tax sovereignty and resist efforts to create an unlevel playing field for our citizens and companies.\u201d\nThe so-called revenge tax, which had stirred debates on Wall Street and law firms across the Atlantic, is moot before it even went into effect.\nThere had been back-and-forth debates in recent weeks about the implications of Section 899 and whether it would push global investors away from the United States.\nThe provision had sent shivers up Wall Street\u2019s spine as it appeared to be another protectionist policy that would penalize global investors who put their money in the United States.\n\u201cGreat concern had been expressed by Wall Street and affected stakeholders about the enactment of Section 899 and its impact on foreign investment in the United States, particularly in view of its complexity, potential scope of application and compliance obligations,\u201d attorneys at law firm Holland & Knight said in a note. \u201cThose concerns have been alleviated for now.\u201d\nInternational business groups were in Wasington in recent weeks negotiating with lawmakers. Jonathan Samford, CEO of the Global Business Alliance, which opposed Section 899, told CNN the provision would have \u201csquandered opportunity and more investment\u201d and contributed to \u201cfurther isolation.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased that President Trump and the administration have pursued this negotiation, and as a result, called for withdrawal of this punitive and discriminatory provision,\u201d he said. \u201cI commend Chairman Smith and Chairman Crapo for focusing on making the United States the most competitive it can be.\u201d\nRepublicans this week had begun hinting that Section 899 might be negotiable. Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett said in an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday that Section 899 might not be included in the final budget bill.\n\u201cYou can try to retaliate, but it\u2019s probably better to work out an agreement than just have a tax fight, just like we\u2019re having tariff fights,\u201d Luscombe said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/27\/investing\/revenge-tax-section-899","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Confused about all the tax changes in the past decade? Just wait","date":"2025-01-15","body":"If keeping up with tax changes in the law were a sport, 2017 and 2025 might be considered the Tax Olympics.\nRecall that during the first year of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s first term, lawmakers defied the odds and passed the largest overhaul of the tax code in more than 30 years.\nNow, this year, lawmakers will use the first 11-plus months of Trump\u2019s second term to decide what to do about huge swaths of that overhaul \u2014 known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That\u2019s because most of its key personal income tax provisions \u2014 and a few business ones \u2014 are set to expire on December 31.\nWhile much has changed in the past several years, one thing hasn\u2019t: The potential for the high-stakes tax debate to create a lot of confusion for filers.\nThey will yet again have to make sense of a head-spinning array of new proposals, amendments and political fights before learning which provisions will stay, which will go and which will be tweaked \u2014 and how all of it combined will affect their bottom line.\nDuring the 2017 debate and the subsequent enactment of the TCJA, enrolled agent Karla Dennis said, \u201cThe majority of my [professional] peers really were just overwhelmed. Tax [changes] were coming at you right and left. \u2026 I don\u2019t know how they expect individuals to keep up with this.\u201d\nRelated articleCheck your mail. The IRS is sending money to 1 million tax filers who aren\u2019t expecting it\nCPA Miklos Ringbauer, treasurer for the California Society of CPAs, noted that the way the original 2017 law was written created a lot of questions and room for interpretation with some provisions, especially a new 20% deduction created for businesses and partnerships that file under the individual income tax code. \u201cThere are a lot of things that were either new or modified that resulted in unanswered questions. And even up until today the IRS is still finalizing some of [its guidance],\u201d Ringbauer said.\nAs for filers, enrolled agent Tom O\u2019Saben, director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Preparers, said some of his clients still have questions seven years after the TCJA\u2019s enactment, partly because they\u2019d been preparing their taxes differently for 25 years beforehand, and partly because so many other high-impact, short-term tax provisions went into effect during the pandemic, like the very large temporary increase in the child tax credit, which had temporarilyslashed the poverty rate in half.\nThere are no fewer than 34TCJA-related tax provisions set to expire in 2025, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Any that are allowed to expire would revert to what they were before TCJA took effect. Among them:\nIndividual income tax rates:The TCJA lowered five of the seven individual income tax rates and changed in most instances the range of taxable income (aka the tax bracket) subject to each rate. The new brackets were still adjusted for inflation each year as they were under the previous tax law, but TCJA applied a different inflation index than the one used for decades up until 2017.\nPersonal exemptions:The TCJA also repealed personal and dependent exemptions, which in 2017 let you deduct $4,050 for yourself, your spouse and your dependents.\nThe standard deduction:The 2017 tax overhaul nearly doubled the standard deduction. In doing so it drastically reduced the number of filers who itemized their deductions, which you only do when your deductions combined exceed your standard. Those deductions include mortgage interest, state and local taxes, foreign taxes and charitable contributions, among others.\nThe child tax credit:The TCJA doubled the size of the child tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your tax liability. It also increased how much of it can be paid out as a refund to filers who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have enough tax liability to offset to get the full credit, and expanded eligibility for who can take it.\nRelated articleThe IRS will start accepting 2024 federal tax returns on January 27\nThe state and local tax deduction:The 2017 law put a $10,000 cap on the so-called SALT deduction, which is available only to those who itemized their deductions. If the cap is allowed to expire, filers would be allowed to deduct all of their state and local income, property and sales taxes. Before TCJA, the SALT deduction was a key reason many people living in high-tax states would itemize since their state and local taxes combined could easily exceed $10,000.\nThe Alternative Minimum Tax:The TCJA drastically reduced the number of filers hit by the AMT \u2014 a parallel tax system that can result in a higher tax bill. Originally created to ensure the highest-income and wealthiest tax filers couldn\u2019t escape paying federal income taxes, it ended up ensnaring upper-middle-income filers, including families with a lot of children and those living in high-tax states, since it disallowed many deductions ordinary filers normally took.\nThe qualified business income deduction:The QBI was created under TCJA and lets businesses filing under the individual tax code deduct 20% of their income. The provision reduces businesses\u2019 incentive to convert to a C corporation to get a lower corporate income tax rate. But to prevent gaming, it also disallows the new deduction for some high-earning filers in certain occupations and limits its benefit for other high earners based on the wages they pay employees and the amount of capital their business invests, according to the Tax Policy Center.\nEstate taxes:Among other changes related to estate and gift taxes, the TCJA nearly doubled how much of your estate would be exempt from federal taxes upon your death. It went from $5.6 million in 2017 to $11.2 million in 2018, which adjusted for inflation has increased it to $13.99 million per person today (or nearly $28 million per married couple).\nWhile the TCJA made many corporate provisions permanent, most of the individual provisions were made temporary to limit the bill\u2019s total cost and stay within the budget rules at the time.\nGoing forward, extending all of the TCJA as is has been estimated tocost $4.6 trillionover 10 years.\nSo, to the extent lawmakers decide they want to keep the TCJA from busting the budget going forward, they may decide to alter the size or eligibility rules for some provisions, decline to extend others, or find other ways to offset the cost of extending most if not all expiring provisions.\nNo matter how emphatically Trump or any lawmaker proposes to extend or amend a tax measure \u2014 or create a new tax provision, such as proposals to not taxSocial Security benefitsortips\u2014 don\u2019t count on it unless and until it\u2019s a matter of law.\nDennis plans to brief her clients throughout the year on the debate and run scenarios for them of what various live proposals would mean for their tax situation, particularly as it applies to the standard deduction, the SALT, the personal exemption and the child tax credit.\nRingbauer said tax professionals, who have more tax tools today to predict and analyze changes, will be able to more quickly identify which clients would be affected by a given proposal and help them \u201cunderstand what the challenge is or the benefits would be of that proposed tax law change.\u201d\nDennis is also cautioning clients not to make any changes based on assumptions. \u201cDo not go into 2025 changing any of your withholdings. Hold steady for this year,\u201d she advised.\nShe also will continue to recommend they maintain good financial records for everything they do, even if under the TCJA they no longer needed documentation for itemizing, since they switched to the standard deduction.\n\u201cKeep your documents. Don\u2019t decide what you can deduct or not deduct,\u201d Dennis said.\nBecause the answer to that tax question and others may change \u2014 a little or a lot \u2014 by the end of this year.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/15\/business\/tax-reform-debate-2025","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Who benefits most from the state and local tax deduction and why raising the cap is contentious","date":"2025-05-20","body":"Increasing the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction could benefit millions of tax filers.\nBut a proposal to do just that has become apoint of contention and a possible roadblockto House Republicans\u2019 passing \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d that reflects President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. That agenda includes making permanent essentially all of the individual income tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are otherwise scheduled to expire this year.\nThe SALT deduction, as it is known, enables federal income tax filers to deduct either their state and local income taxes or their state and local general sales taxes. In addition, they are also allowed to deduct their property taxes, assuming their income or sales taxes don\u2019t put them over the cap. The tax break, however, may only be taken by those who itemize deductions on their federal returns, which only a minority of filers do.\nRelated articleTrump to personally appeal to lawmakers as major sticking points remain unresolved on his \u2018one big, beautiful\u2019 agenda bill\nPrior to 2017, there was no limit on the SALT deduction.\nBut the TCJA imposed a $10,000 cap \u2014 which, when coupled with the expanded standard deduction under that tax law, meant the number of people who claimed the SALT deduction fell dramatically \u2014 from about one-quarter of filers in 2017, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, to less than 10% today.\nGoing forward, it appears there will still be a cap, but it likely will be higher than $10,000. The question is just how much higher and for whom?\nThe House Ways and Means and House Budget committees already approved a tax package that would permanently raise the cap to $30,000 for any taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income is $400,000 or less if married filing jointly (and $200,000 or less for single filers). But anyone above those income thresholds would still be able to deduct at least $10,000, according to the Tax Foundation.\nBut a small group of House Republicans with constituents who benefit from the tax break publicly rejected the proposal. By Wednesday morning, House Speaker Mike Johnson said anew agreement was reachedwith the so-called SALT caucus to raise the cap to $40,000 for a decade for households making less than $500,000. For those making more, the cap would be reduced gradually between $500,000 and $800,000. Households making more than $800,000 would be able to deduct $10,000.\nWhat\u2019s not clear is whether that compromise, if finalized, will be accepted by conservatives who dislike the SALT deduction and have been insisting on deep spending cuts.\nRepublicans introduced the cap as part of their 2017 tax cuts bill to help pay for the sweeping legislation. And they are hoping to use it again as a revenue raiser in this year\u2019s package.\nFor example, the $30,000 cap proposal was estimated to raise $915.6 billion over 10 years relative to simply letting the cap expire as it is otherwise set to do if lawmakers don\u2019t act, according to estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation.\nA higher cap covering more households, like that reached in the tentative agreement Wednesday, will result in less revenue gained. That may further fuel the intraparty battle over the SALT deduction between GOP lawmakers from high-tax blue states, such as California and New York, and their colleagues from lower-tax red states, whose residents don\u2019t benefit from the deduction nearly as much.\nAnd even if all House GOP can get on board, it\u2019s not clear where the Senate, which is expected to amend the final House tax-and-spending bill, will come down.\nRelated articleHere\u2019s what\u2019s in the House GOP\u2019s sweeping tax and spending cuts package\nIt\u2019s hardly the first time SALT has been the subject of dispute in modern times, said tax historian Joe Thorndike.\nThe SALT break has been on the books since 1913, when the federal income tax code was created. It also had a decade-long stint during the Civil War as well.\nBut there have been efforts to limit the deduction over the past five decades. While originally the SALT deduction was created so that the federal government didn\u2019t encroach upon states\u2019 ability to collect revenue, SALT today is portrayed as a subsidy to high-tax states and as regressive in that it disproportionately benefits higher-income households, Thorndike noted.\nIn 2020, the SALT deduction was claimed on just 8.6% of all federal tax returns, according to the Tax Policy Center.\nBut the incidence of people claiming it was most concentrated in 13 states and the District of Columbia.\nThe deduction was claimed on more than 20% of returns from Maryland and Washington, DC; and on 10% to 20% of returns filed by residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Utah, Virginia and Washington State.\nAnd those who have received the biggest break \u2014 both before and after the cap was imposed \u2014 are high-income filers, especially those in high-tax states and cities.\nIn 2017, before the cap went into effect, for example, roughly two-thirds of the benefit went to those with incomes of $200,000 or more, according to the center. The average SALT deduction was about $13,000, but it topped $30,000 in eight counties, mostly in California and New York.\nWhile the vast majority of middle- and upper-income households received tax relief from TCJA regardless of where they lived, they would have received even more, had the cap not been instituted, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at theTPC.\nFor example, the tax cut for those in the top 20% would have been $2,500 larger, on average, had their state and local tax deductions not been limited,according to the center.

(Specific relief notices by disaster area can be foundhereon the IRS Web site.) For example, the IRS pushed the tax filing and payment deadlines to October 15 for those in countiesaffected by the Los Angeles area wildfires.\nCan\u2019t or don\u2019t want to file by April 15:That is okay so long as youapply for an automatic six-month extensionby that date. That kind of extension, however, is simply an extension to file your 2024 return, but not an extension to pay what you owe. If you owe any money to the IRS for tax year 2024, April 15 is still your payment deadline.\nTheIRS Direct File program, which lets eligible taxpayers file their taxes directly with the IRS for free, is now available in 25 states, up from 12 last year when the agency piloted the program.\nRelated articleConfused about all the tax changes in the past decade? Just wait\nThe states are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\nIn addition, the IRS ispartnering with certain private-sector tax preparation software firmsthat will let you file for free if you qualify.

(The old threshold used to be $20,000.)\nYou might also get a 1099-K if those combined transactions were less than that, especially if you live in Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont or Virginia, where the reporting threshold is set at $600.\nIf you get a 1099-K in error \u2014 e.g., the form includes transactions that were personal in nature \u2014 checkthis IRS documentfor some tips on how to correct the situation.\nBut, generally speaking, the IRS expects you to report all the 1099-K information you receive on your 2024 return. Then adjust for any errors either on that return usingSchedule 1or via an amended return after you filing your original by your filing deadline (which you should do toavoid penalties if you owe money).\nIf you purchased an electric vehicle, that qualifies for the clean vehicle energy credit or used clean vehicle credit. Your dealer should send both you and the IRS aForm 15400, known as a Clean Vehicle Seller Report. Information from it should be reported on your return to help you claim or reconcile the credit your claim on your return, according to NATP.\nThere isa lot of talkabout increasing the state and local tax deduction. None of it applies to your 2024 tax return.

{"title":"Here\u2019s which grocery store items will get more expensive because of tariffs","date":"2025-04-09","body":"President Donald Trump, during his announcement last week ofsweeping tariffson countries around the world, called groceries an \u201cold-fashioned\u201d and \u201cbeautiful term.\u201d But his policies will make America\u2019s groceries more expensive today, supermarket executives and food industry experts say.\nSupermarkets sell imported items in every section of the store: from fresh and packaged foods to household basics. Trump instituted 10% tariffs across all countries last Saturday. US businesses shipping goods from overseas will pay for those tariffs, and they will pass some of the higher costs down to consumers.\nShoppers can expect to see prices rise on seafood, coffee, fruit, cheese, nuts, candy bars and other imported foods, according to experts. Items that contain ingredients and packaging like plastic and aluminum from other countries will also be hit. Perishable food prices will rise first, followed by shelf-stable goods. Customers may also see smaller-sized products, known asshrinkflation, and find that certain versions of items have been eliminated as companies try to offset their cost hikes from tariffs.\nCustomers can expect grocery prices to increase \u201cin the next couple of weeks,\u201d said John Ross, the CEO of IGA,a chain of independent grocery stores. \u201cShoppers will start seeing it at scale across the store in the next 90 days.\u201d\nFood prices will rise 2.8% overall from Trump\u2019s tariffs, including 4% for fresh produce, Yale University\u2019s Budget Labestimates. The cost burden will hit lower-income shoppers, who spend a greater share of their income on essentials, the hardest.\nThe scale of the price hikes will also depend on the size of the companies.\nPrices at smaller grocers, which have less flexibility to absorb higher costs than giant chains like Walmart and Costco, may rise faster. Big food suppliers such as Campbell and Kraft Heinz also have more flexibility to manage tariffs than smaller producers. But few companies will be spared from the effects.\n\u201cIt appears that the small distributors are reacting a lot more quickly,\u201d said Steve Schwartz, the director of sales and marketing at grocery chain Morton Williams. Small distributors have less supply on hand and will raise prices first, while larger companies with more inventory in warehouses can wait longer, Schwartz said.\nFor example, one Italian importer that supplies olive oil and balsamic vinegar notified Morton Williams of a 20% price increase next month.\nRandy Arceneaux, the CEO Affiliated Foods, a wholesaler in Amarillo, Texas servicing around 700 independent grocery stores in eight states, said that most suppliers are still waiting to see what happens with tariffs.\nBut that\u2019s not the case with all Affiliated Food\u2019s suppliers \u2014several have already notified the company of price increases because of tariffs, including bananas and canned tuna, as well as plastic utensils.\nAffiliated Foods sources bananas from Guatemala, where Trump implemented a 10% tariff. Affiliated Foods\u2019 distributor notified the company that a 10% price increase will go into effect next week.\nThis will increase Affiliated Foods\u2019 costs by 4 cents per banana case, from $1.80 to $1.84, which will be passed on to shoppers.\nThe foods Americans eat are part of a complicated global supply chain, with much of the growing impossible to replicate stateside because of climate and crop conditions. Food that can\u2019t be grown locally will see the biggest rise in prices.\nCurrently, the USimportsapproximately 17% of all food and beverages consumed by Americans, but it varies dramatically by category. For example, around 80% of seafood, 80% of coffee, 59% of fresh fruit and 35% of vegetables consumed in the United States are imported, according to the Department of Agriculture.\n\u201cOur food system is intricately linked with global markets \u2212 including products not grown in the United States like bananas or seasonal items \u2212 which helps keep prices down while providing American shoppers year-round access to safe, nutritious food,\u201d Leslie Sarasin, the president of food industry group FMI, said in a statement last week.\nBut one major factor that could limit price increases is that Mexico and Canada wereleft off Trump\u2019s latest tariff list. Mexico and Canada are the two largest agricultural suppliers to the United States, according to theAgriculture Department.\nThe White House has slapped 25% tariffs on those countries, but most food and agricultural products are exempt from tariffs under the existing USMCA free trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.\nGrocery prices already frustrated customers before tariffs. Trumpsaidhe won the 2024 election in large part due to the price of groceries.\nGrocery prices overall have increased around 23% since 2021, with prices on individual items like coffee and chocolate rising much faster.\nThat\u2019s caused shoppers to pull back. PepsiCo, Campbell and JM Smucker reportedweak salesof their snack brands in recent earnings announcements, and tariffs will likely only accelerate the slowdown.\nPepsiCo, the owner of Frito-Lay, said last month that people bought 3% fewer snacks last quarter.\n\u201cSalty and savory snack categories underperformed\u201d the broader packaged food industry, PepsiCo said, citing the \u201ccumulative impacts of inflationary pressures and higher borrowing costs on consumer budgets.\u201d\nHousehold staples, such as dish detergent, paper towels and cosmetics, have also seen a slowdown in recent weeks, according to market research firm Circana.\n\u201cSome consumers are moving away from discretionary spending\u201d at the grocery store, said Sally Lyons Wyatt, Circana\u2019s chief advisor for the consumer goods and food service industries.\nMore shoppers are taking quicker, smaller trips to stores, and switching to stores\u2019 cheaper private-label brands, she said. These are signs that customers are watching their budgets more carefully.\nCustomers \u201care still showing that willingness to spend, but they\u2019re being very choiceful where they\u2019re spending,\u201d Costco finance chief Gary Millerchip said last month.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/09\/business\/grocery-prices-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"When too much feels out of control, make a just-in-case financial plan","date":"2025-09-16","body":"With so many unsettling things happening beyond your \u2014 or any individual\u2019s \u2014 control, it sometimes can help to proactively do something concrete that would be helpful to you and your family.\nTake, as just one example, the state of the US economy. There is no shortage ofconfusing signalsand analysis. Is it in a recession, edging towards one,  or on the verge of recovering from one? Or \u2014 extra fun \u2014 are we in for a protracted period ofstagflation?\nWhatever the answers (which may only be confirmed \u2014 annoyingly \u2014 in hindsight), you can take steps now to shore up your own personal safety net to protect yourself and your family against potential headwinds and unwelcome events.\nThey all come down to figuring out what is true about your life as it is today. Here are four suggestions:\nYou may feel a little better if you quit doom scrolling and instead begin \u201cfocusing on your personal economy, not the macroeconomy,\u201d said Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and founder of Bone Fide Wealth.\nBy that he means your household finances.\nFor starters, Boneparth recommends getting a realistic assessment of how much your monthly outlay is for essential living expenses (e.g., housing, utilities, food, health care, debt payments) versus those expenses that you could forgo if push came to shove.\nThe total for your essential expenses is what will give you a reliable sense of how much you may want to set aside for emergencies like a layoff \u2014 or, if that\u2019s not possible, at least have available to you (e.g., through a home equity line of credit).\nHow can you prevent being laid off? You can\u2019t. Here\u2019s why\nHow many months of living expenses you\u2019ll need depends on your circumstance: For instance, are you the sole breadwinner? Do you have kids? Are you just starting a new business that won\u2019t generate income for a while? Are you working in an industry where it\u2019s hard to find a new job quickly? Are you likely to get some severance?\nFor most people, the range of living expenses they might want available just in case might be anywhere from three months to a year.\nIf you\u2019re a new or soon-to-be retiree, knowing what your essential expenses are also will help you determine how much to have in a liquid account that you can draw on for income when the market is down and you don\u2019t want sell assets and lock in those losses from your investment portfolio.\nUnwelcome events \u2014 like illness, disability or death, or natural disasters \u2014 will happen at some point. But no one can know exactly when or who will be hit next.\nThat\u2019s an argument for insuring against the financial fallout from such events for yourself and those you (someday will) leave behind.\nWhether you need a given insurance policy \u2013 and if so, how much \u2013 depends in part on where you are today.\nTakelife insurance. It may be essential if your children are young and you still are carrying a big mortgage or if you bring in the lion\u2019s share of your family\u2019s income.\nBut if your kids are launched and your house is paid off \u2014 or you don\u2019t have kids and you only support yourself \u2014 you might not need it at all.\nHow much life insurance do you need?\nFigure out, too, how much insurance coverage you have if you become disabled and can\u2019t work for a spell. Thiscoverage is a must for many, regardless of whether you support others or just yourself. Such insurance will replace a portion of your salary over a specified period of time. Often, employers provide somedisability coverageto you as part of your benefits package, but you may be given the choice to augment it for a monthly cost if you think you would need more.\nAlso consider whether your currenthome insurancepolicy sufficiently insures you financially in the event of extreme weather events that could destroy your home or possessions.\nUS stocks have been doing very well. Despite plunging in the wake of the April announcement of the widely criticized Trump tariff regime, they have more than recovered, with the Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq allhitting record highsrecently.\nThat trend won\u2019t last, of course. It never does.\nAnd that\u2019s not a bad thing, Boneparth said. \u201cYou can\u2019t compound returns over time without (there being) volatility and down markets. You have to be willing to go down 35% sometimes to go up 300% over time.\u201d\nThat said, how much actual risk you\u2019re taking in your investment portfolio today \u2014 in terms of your exposure to equities and alternative investments like crypto or real estate \u2014 should match your current ability and willingness to take that risk. \u201cWhat felt fine in 2020 might feel reckless in 2025,\u201d he said.\nMake your money work when you\u2019re not: Creating an income-producing portfolio\nFor instance, those in their 50s and 60s are now five years closer to retirement. You still have decades to be invested, assuming you live into your 80s. But you don\u2019t have decades to go before having to tap some of your investments.\nOr, whatever your age, you are now five years closer to a specific goal that once may have seemed far off, like sending your child to college or buying a house.\nIn addition to considering your time horizon, Boneparth said, the right amount of risk to take has to strike a balance between a) how much is needed for your investments to meet your long-term goals (eg, hiding in low-yielding cash assets likely won\u2019t cut it); and b) how much risk you can handle emotionally without panicking when a bear market or recession hits, or stocks drop like a stone in response to shock events.\nIf you want your loved ones to remember you fondly, one thing you can do now is compile a list of all the locations, passwords and account numbers for your insurance policies, credit cards, email and social media accounts, as well as bank, brokerage and retirement accounts. Also include contact information for the people whom you\u2019ve dealt with in relation to those accounts and policies.\nBut keep it all in a secure location.\n\u201cI have a letter in our safe called the death note,\u201d Boneparth said.\nThe idea isn\u2019t to be morbid. It\u2019s simply to minimize the time and frustration of someone else having to manage your digital and non-digital life after you\u2019re gone or if you become too incapacitated to handle things yourself.\nReassessing and making changes to anything having to do with your finances takes energy and time.\nThe key is not to get overwhelmed and think everything has to be done all at once.\nOn the contrary, Boneparth suggests, aim \u201cfor progress over perfection. Give yourself some grace and start with what\u2019s easiest for you. Get that win. Then (that can help) build momentum.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/16\/business\/protect-yourself-from-financial-headwinds","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Make your money work for you by \u2018laddering\u2019 bonds or CDs","date":"2025-08-16","body":"If you have a lot of cash on hand, it should be making money for you.\nOne way to ensure it continuously does that is to set up a ladder of Treasuries or FDIC-insured certificates of deposit with staggered maturities (eg, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, etc.).\nA laddering strategy can offer low-risk, predictable returns that will help you keep up with \u2014 or beat \u2014 inflation, while protecting your money during volatile markets and helping you meet your near- and intermediate-term goals.\n\u201cWhich ladder works for you depends on your needs,\u201d said Collin Martin, a fixed income strategist at Schwab Center for Financial Research.\nFor example, ladders can be useful if you want to:\nPreserve purchasing power:A fixed income ladder can help if your main concern for a given sum of money is to protect the principal and not let inflation devalue it.\nRhode-Island based certified financial planner Sue Gardiner had a client whose goal was to preserve capital and protect purchasing power of money going to beneficiaries of an inherited IRA that had to be fully distributed within 10 years.\n\u201cSo we used TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) to hedge inflation, but balanced them with Treasuries and brokered CDs to lock in competitive yields and keep annual liquidity,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ladder was designed so each year\u2019s withdrawal is funded by maturing securities.\u201d\nPay off debt:If you have credit card debt and can secure a zero-rate balance transfer card \u2014 which lets you pay off your debt interest free for up to 21 months \u2014 a ladder of CDs or bonds can generate additional income to help clear your balance.\nSay you have $100,000 from the sale of a house or an inheritance. If you don\u2019t already have an emergency fund, set aside some of the money into a high-yield FDIC-insured online savings account or a money market fund. Then split the rest evenly across the number of \u201crungs\u201d in the ladder you choose. For instance, a three-month CD or Treasury, another one maturing in six months and a third one maturing in a year.\nAs a CD or Treasury comes due, direct the income it throws off plus some or all of the principal to pay down your 0% credit card debt, Gardiner suggested.\nGrow savings for a specific end dat\ufeffe:Or, say you want to have enough money to make a down payment on a home in five years. \u201cIf the goal has a finite date, ladder the strategy so all the money is available for the down payment [on that date],\u201d Gardiner said.\nSet up a cash flow stream:If you\u2019re about to retire but won\u2019t claim Social Security for a few years, you might consider a laddered bonds strategy to provide a steady income stream between now and then or even for longer.\n\u201cIt provides stability and predictability while bridging the gap until larger income sources like Social Security kick in, or to create a predictable foundation while other assets are positioned for growth,\u201d Wade Pfau, founder of the site Retirement Researcher, wrote inan articleabout bond laddering. \u201cAs one (bond) matures, the principal is returned and can be reinvested or spent, depending on your needs at that time.\u201d\nTo set up a laddering strategy that works for you, consider these questions:\nHow long before I need the money?Be very clear what your liquidity needs will be for the money you\u2019re investing.\nOnce a ladder of investments with staggering maturities is set up, if you tap any before they come due, you may have to pay a penalty in the case of CDs that you buy directly from a bank; or you might lose some of your principal if you\u2019re selling a bond (or a CD purchased through a brokerage) when you sell it back into the secondary market.\n\u201cMake sure you match up maturities of those holdings with what your time horizon is. You don\u2019t want to suddenly need all of it and be forced to sell at a loss,\u201d Martin said.\nAlso know that any investment on your ladder that is labeled \u201ccallable\u201d means the issuer can recall it and pay you back your principal before the instrument comes due, plus any income owed up until that point. So ideally, you will only invest in non-callable CDs or bonds, otherwise you might need to reinvest it sooner than you think.\nDoes it make more sense to invest in CDs or bonds?What you\u2019ll net after taxes from your investment is a key consideration. The income you earn from a CD is taxable at the federal, state and local level. If you invest in Treasuries, the income is exempt from state and local taxes. So if you live in a high-tax area, they may be a better bet. But if you live in a state with no income tax or very low income taxes and the yield on a CD is better than a bond of similar duration, the CD may be your better bet.\nDo I want to manage the ladder myself?If you\u2019re setting up a ladder of CDs or Treasuries for a one-time, date-certain purpose and your plan is to use the money as it comes due, that might be the simplest thing for you to set up and manage.\nBut if your plan is to use a ladder on an ongoing basis for income, that will mean you have to keep track of everything and be proactive about reinvesting your money whenever it comes due to maximize your income potential. Alternatively, there are now someETFs that ladder bonds, which can do the work for you if they\u2019re structured in a way that meets your goals.\nIf you\u2019re building you own ladder, your brokerage may offer model laddering strategies that will help you set one up and then can automatically do the reinvesting for you if you choose.\nIf, however, you\u2019re considering laddering municipal bonds for their tax advantages or corporate bonds to maximize yield, you might consult a fixed income adviser or have an investment professional manage your ladder for you because those instruments require a little more research to make sure you\u2019re getting the risk-reward trade-off.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to blindly invest in those,\u201d Martin said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/08\/16\/business\/building-a-cd-or-bond-ladder","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Copper prices have surged to record highs \u2014 and they could jump higher. Here\u2019s why","date":"2025-07-17","body":"Copper is at the core of the American economy. It\u2019s in the wires of our pervasive electronics, in the walls of homes and in the engines of cars. Experts say President Donald Trump\u2019s plan for tariffs on the red metal could stymy the goal ofboosting American manufacturingwhile potentially igniting inflation.\nTrump\u2019s July 8announcementof a 50% tariff on copper imports beginning August 1 sent prices surging 13% in one day, up to a record high of $5.69 per pound.\nIt was the biggest single-day increase in copper prices on record going back to 1968, according to FactSet.\nAnd those prices could just be a sign of things to come. A 50% tariff would be a \u201cmassive tax on consumers of copper,\u201d Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note.\nWhile Trump says his copper tariff is needed to spur domestic production due to national security concerns, there is no quick fix.\nThe US imports over 50% of the copper it needs, primarily from South America, Hansen said, \u201cwith no clear path to improving that for years to come.\u201d\nThat\u2019s because it takes almost 32 years, on average, from the discovery of mineable copper in the US to production, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. And the end result of a big and fast copper tariff could simply be higher prices for many items, economists say.\n\u201cA tariff-induced price premium risks making copper\u2014and by extension, US manufacturing and infrastructure\u2014materially more expensive,\u201d Hansen said.\nCopper is highly conductive, making it a critical input for electrical and electronic products. Copper can be found in the chips in mobile phones, plumbing in houses and in the engines of cars.\n\u201cThis is a vital metal for everyday use,\u201d Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank\u2019s asset management group, told CNN. \u201cYou probably don\u2019t go a day where you haven\u2019t used something that has copper in it.\u201d\nAs Trump\u2019s self-imposed August 1 tariff deadline approaches, businesses and investors don\u2019t know what will happen in the wake of a massive tariff on a key component of the economy \u2014 let alone if the president will follow through with it at all, considering his history of backing off tariff threats.\nCopper is one of the most widely used metals in the world. The typical American-made car has over 50 pounds of copper,accordingto the Copper Development Association, a trade group.\nRelated articleThe Trump administration just doubled the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Here\u2019s what that means\nAnd the price of copper has beenrisingin recent years.The growing market for electric vehicles and the expansion of data centers thanks to the artificial intelligence boom have helped drive global demand for copper.\nCopper prices this year have smashed through previous records amid Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs. Copper futures in New York have soared almost 39% this year, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 6% gain, bitcoin\u2019s 24% gain andgold\u2019s26% gain.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs on metals, includingsteel and aluminum, are intended to bolster US supply chains. His administration also cited national security concerns for levying a tariff on copper.\nBut an import tax on copper would raise production costs for manufacturers in industries including construction, electronic goods and automobiles, according to Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics.\n\u201cAll these tariffs raise costs and therefore injure downstream manufacturing,\u201d Maurice Obstfeld, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley and member of former president Barack Obama\u2019s council of economic advisers, told CNN.\n\u201cFor the US, this seems like a fairly pointless act of self-harm,\u201d Obstfeld added.\nBusinesses would face higher costs because there aren\u2019t many viable substitutes for copper, according to Brandon Parsons, a practitioner of economics at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School. While aluminum can be a substitute, it is more flammable and does not have the same conductivity, making it less viable for using in items like semiconductor chips.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t really a good way for businesses or consumers to avoid these higher costs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be felt widespread through the economy.\u201d\nChile, Canada and Peru provided over 90% of US copper imports in 2024, according to the US Geological Survey.\nThe United States in 2024 mined an estimated 1.1 million tons of copper, according to the US Geological Survey, meeting just under half of its consumption. Arizona was home to more than 70% of domestic copper production in 2024.\nShifting economic incentives in the modern era and the opening of free trade have both contributed to a decline in US copper production, according to Pepperdine\u2019s Parsons.\nThe United States in recent decades has produced less copper as the global economy liberalized, enabling the country to import relatively cheap copper from countries like Chile and allowing the US economy to expand to other industries.\nIndustrial buyers and Wall Street traders in recent months have shipped enormous amounts of copper to the United States to get ahead of potential tariffs. Morgan Stanley estimates 400,000 tons, or roughly six months\u2019 worth of \u201cextra\u201d copper was front-loaded and delivered to the US in the early months of 2025.\nThe copper stockpiles could \u201ctemporarily buffer\u201d the market when tariffs go into effect, according to Ewa Manthey, a commodity strategist at Dutch bankING.\nHowever, the buildup of copper won\u2019t last forever, and it\u2019ll be difficult for the US to produce enough copper domestically. At some point, the US will likely need to import more copper under the 50% tariff, which could risk a resurgence in inflation, Manthey said.\n\u201cHigher copper prices also risk higher inflation, raising costs for US manufacturers without a domestic alternative available,\u201d Manthey said.\nIt remains to be seen whether companies will absorb the higher costs or pass the costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices, although economic theory suggests businesses would pass on higher costs to consumers when possible.\nRelated articleHere\u2019s how Trump\u2019s tariffs could be impacting prices for US consumers\nWall Street and corporate America have been expecting  tariffs on copper \u2014 just not 50%.\n\u201cInvestors were caught off guard, as the market had been expecting a much lower tariff rate,\u201d Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said in an email.\nSmaller tariff rates such as 10% can be used strategically to encourage domestic manufacturing, economists say. But a rate as high as 50% could send a shock to markets, even leading to a drop in demand because prices are just too high.\nThat could lead to slower economic growth across industries, such as a lull in home building.\nTrump has espoused using tariffs as a means to boost US manufacturing. But tariffs are not a panacea that will revive the manufacturing industry, Pepperdine\u2019s Parsons said.\n\u201cThe rationale for this is to encourage production and investment in copper in the United States,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cThe issue is it\u2019s not like producing water, where you just open up the faucet. It could take years and years to open up a new copper mine, or even to expand production. So, while this does provide some incentive, it\u2019s something that\u2019s more long-run. You\u2019re going to feel the short-run pain.\u201d\nIncentives like direct government subsidies or credits could promote domestic production of copper and fortify US supply chains, according to Parsons. While tariffs can help domestic companies sell more in the market, the higher prices can create unwanted ripple effects throughout the supply chain.\nTrump in February signed an executive order opening a Section 232 investigation into copper imports. That section of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act gives the president the authority to impose import duties to protect industries deemed vital to US national security.\n\u201cThe United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain, with increasing reliance on foreign sources for mined, smelted and refined copper,\u201d theexecutive ordersaid.\nA Section 232 investigation comes with a 270-day deadline for an investigation, which means the Trump administration had until November to complete its review of copper, according to ING\u2019s Manthey.\n\u201cThere are many foreign suppliers of copper, including close allies like Canada, so a national security rationale seems contrived,\u201d Berkeley\u2019s Obstfeld said.\nRelated articleTrump invokes wartime powers to increase production of critical minerals\nTrump said in a social media post on July 9 confirming his intent to impose tariffs on copper that the metal is the second most-used metal in the Defense Department.\nBut copper was not one of the 50 critical minerals designated by the US Geological Survey in 2022. The US Geological Survey is expected to publish an updated classification list for critical minerals this year.\nHowever, copper is considered a \u201ccritical material\u201d for energy, according to the Energy Department.\n\u201cThe US has very limited current mining capacity,\u201d Obstfeld said. \u201cIt will take a decade or more to onshore copper production substantially. That will still leave copper prices much higher in the US, and in the meantime, American consumers and businesses will suffer even more.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/17\/investing\/copper-prices-us-market-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"How Walmart\u2019s CEO made it the store for literally everyone","date":"2025-11-14","body":"Walmart\u2019s run as America\u2019s largest retailer appeared to be in jeopardy when Doug McMillon became Walmart\u2019s chief executive 11 years ago.\nWalmart\u2019s business was struggling, its public image was reeling from abribery scandalin Mexico that reached top leaders, and protesters rallied outside storesnationwideover low pay and working conditions. \u201cWalmart is falling apart before our eyes,\u201d one analystsaid.\nBut today, Walmart has never been stronger. The company\u2019s stock recently hit all-time highs. Sales are surging, even as rivals such as Target, Home Depot and others slump. And Walmart raised wages and expanded benefits, becoming a business schoolcase studyon employee retention.\nMuch of that is thanks to McMillon, who announced Friday that he\u2019sretiringsoon as CEO. He oversaw Walmart\u2019s transformation from a brick-and-mortar discount superstore that largely appealed to lower-income Americans to an everything store, everywhere for everyone.\nMcMillon, a Walmart lifer who took the top job at 47 as the company\u2019s youngest CEO since founder Sam Walton, reinvented Walmart by threading one of the thinnest needles in retail: reaching new shoppers online while retaining old customers in stores. Walmart under McMillon used its unparalleled size to press suppliers into keeping prices ultra-low, all while adding new higher-end brands and growing online to attract a wealthier clientele.\nAnd McMillon accomplished this pivot while navigating contentious political and social issues in America that have engulfed many companies, such as Target and Bud Light.\nMcMillon\u2019s successor, veteran Walmart leader John Furner, will have to handle these challenges, as well as pressure from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and an uncertain future of shopping with AI.Walmartrecently said it\u2019s partnering with OpenAI to let users browse and make purchases directly through chatbot ChatGPT.\nLow and middle-income shoppers historically formed the customer base of Walmart\u2019s superstores in rural and suburban America.\nBut Walmart has increasingly drawn higher-income customers in recent years. Shoppers making more than $100,000 a year havefueledWalmart\u2019s growth in recent years.\nWalmart\u2019s grocery business has underpinned its success. More than half of Walmart\u2019s sales come from groceries, and the company has used its size and scale to muscle down prices andinvestin improving its meat and produce aisles. That has benefitted Walmart throughout McMillon\u2019s tenure, particularly during the post-pandemic inflation crisis that sent America searching for value that Walmart could help deliver.\nAt the same time, Walmart under McMillon has built a strong e-commerce business to compete with Amazon and draw shoppers online. It has added the option to buy online and pick up in store to thousands of its locations and Walmart+, its same-day grocery delivery membership.\nAlthough Amazon leads e-commerce sales in the United States by a wide margin, accounting for 40.6% of sales,Walmart comes in secondwith 9.4%, according to market research firm eMarketer.\n\u201cThe most notable change during McMillon\u2019s tenure has been Walmart\u2019s evolution into a major e-commerce company,\u201d said RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Placer.ai.\nMcMillon also has deftly steered Walmart through political culture wars on guns, LGBTQ rights, immigration, the Confederate flag and other issues.\nWalmart, historically a conservative company based in deep-red Arkansas, appeals to a wide swath of America.\nIt has worked carefully to stake out positions in the political middle to avoid offending customers and employees, and taken a slow, gradual approach to changing policies such asgun and ammunitionsales. Dan Bartlett, the former communications director for President George W. Bush, has helped shape Walmart\u2019s do-no-harm public affairs strategy.\n\u201cPolitics moves around,\u201d McMillonsaidin a 2017 interview. \u201cWe are on our 11th administration, since Walmart was born. There will be a 12th. There will be a 13th.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/14\/business\/walmart-doug-mcmillon-customers","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Trump teases he\u2019ll fire Bessent if Fed doesn\u2019t cut interest rates","date":"2025-11-19","body":"President Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested he would fire Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentif the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t decrease interest rates.\n\u201cThe only thing Scott is blowing it on is the Fed because the Fed, the rates are too high, Scott. If you don\u2019t get it fixed fast, I\u2019m going to fire your ass,\u201d the president said, smirking, during a speech at a US-Saudi investment forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.\nHowever, it won\u2019t be easy for Trump to bend the Fed to his will: The Fed makes its decisions on interest rates independently, based solely on economic data, meaning that firing Bessent would simply not lead to lower rates. Several Fed officials have also said in recent public comments that they remain concerned about inflation, leaning against further rate cuts.\nThe president has been a frequent critic of the central bank and its chair,Jerome Powell, throughout his second term as the Federal Reserve declined to cut interest rates this year until September. But he acknowledged on Wednesday that Bessent has been privately urging him not to fire Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly said he wants out of the job.\nTrump appeared to suggest that Bessent has been the \u201cvoice of reason,\u201d while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u201cis a little bit more for firing\u201d Powell.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t fire him. He\u2019s got three months to go,\u2019\u201d the president said, appearing to repeat what Bessent has told him of Powell.\n\u201cI want to get him out,\u201d Trump said, reenacting their conversation.\n\u201cI think Howard is a little bit more for firing him. I think Howard would say get him the hell out of there,\u201d the president said\nTrump frequently threatened to fire Powell during the spring, but the president eventually backed off from those threats after his closest advisers warned of the chaos in financial markets that could ensue if he were to do so,CNN previously reported.\nWednesday is the first time Trump has appeared to suggest that Bessent, who has become well-respected on Wall Street, was one of the voices urging him to keep Powell in his role until the end of his term.\n\u201cMarkets have really appreciated having Bessent around,\u201d James Ragan, director of wealth management research at DA Davidson, told CNN.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very much the voice of reason in the Trump administration, so I don\u2019t like to hear him challenging Bessent,\u201d he added.\nFed officials say their decisions on rates are guided solely by what economic figures show, and they strive to achieve their dual mandate of full employment and stable prices. That\u2019s precisely why Trump\u2019s frequent demands for lower rates have largely fallen on deaf ears \u2014 and may continue to do so.\nThe Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee, led by Powell as chair, began to lower interest rates in September for the first time in nine months, and delivered another quarter-point rate cut at its latest meeting last month. October\u2019s rate cuts bring the benchmark lending rate toits lowest in three years.\nThe Fed has been lowering rates to prevent unemployment from surging, though officials are divided over whether they should continue to lower rates withinflation still above their 2% targetand Trump\u2019s tariffs still threatening to push inflation higher.\nMinutes from the Fed\u2019s October meeting underscored the heated debate among the policymakers of the world\u2019s most powerful central bank, with several stating that they prefer to stand pat in December: \u201cMany participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year,\u201d the minutes said.\nInvestors currently see a roughly 68% chance of the Fed holding rates steady next month, according to futures, compared to a 32% chance of another cut.\nNew data on the labor market\u2019s health in September, which was delayed due to the government shutdown, is due on Thursday. Signs that the labor market is falling off a cliff would prompt the Fed to continue to lowering borrowing costs heading into next year, though officials are keeping a close eye on inflation.\nHow the Fed makes its decisions is no secret, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from repeatedly demanding aggressive rate cuts and lambasting Powell, whose term ends in May.\nTrump could name Powell\u2019s successor as early as December, and there arefive people on his short list, according to Bessent, who has led the search. But even if Trump names a loyalist who would call for aggressive rate cuts, that still wouldn\u2019t do the trick because the Fed chair only gets one vote and they cannot unilaterally veto what the majority of the Fed\u2019s 12-person rate-setting committee decides.\nThe new Fed chair, whoever it may be, would have to persuade their colleagues to go along with any plans to lower rates aggressively, and at the moment, only one Fed official said he believes that is the right approach: Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who is taking an unpaid leave from his job as a top White House economist to temporarily serve on the Fed\u2019s board.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/19\/politics\/bessent-trump-federal-reserve-powell","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"When it makes sense to help your adult kids financially \u2014 and when it doesn\u2019t","date":"2025-11-30","body":"Spending the holidays with your adult children and the grandkids?\nIf so, their futures may be on your mind, especially if you sense \u2013 or they just flat-out say \u2013 they\u2019re not flush enough to buy a home, put their own kids through school, or pay off big debts they\u2019ve acquired.\nAs a parent, you may wonder if you should help them or if it makes more sense to stay out of it and leave them money after you die, if that\u2019s an option.\nTo figure out what is right for you, here are four questions to consider:\nThink carefully about how much you can comfortably offer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s understandable to want to support your children. (But) balance that emotion with whether you can afford it,\u201d said Rob Williams, head of Financial Planning and Wealth Management Research at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\nConsider your cash inflow and your spend rate along with how much of a cushion you\u2019ll need to handle unexpected medical expenses or long-term care, said Dawn Jinsky, a certified financial planner and a partner at Plante Moran.\nIf money is tight, Jinsky noted, it\u2019s okay to say, \u201cWe really want to but can\u2019t right now.\u201d\nOr maybe you feel you can afford to give money now, just not on a regular basis. So set expectations. \u201cFrame it as a one-time gift,\u201d Jinsky said.\nYour children\u2019s financial circumstances won\u2019t be identical and you may be considering helping the one who currently has the greatest need.\nBut if your goal is to be fair to your other kids, too, you can do that in ways that don\u2019t require you to part with more money now.\nSay you have three kids and plan to give one $50,000 today. You might amend your estate documents to make sure the other two children each get $50,000 more after you\u2019re gone, Jinsky suggested.\nBut you might want to explain that to all three kids. \u201cCommunication is key when it comes to family dynamics,\u201d she said.\nAssuming you will have what you need to live comfortably, there are three potentially good reasons to give your offspring money while you\u2019re alive.\nFirst, they may benefit more from financial help in their earlier adult years than, say, in their 60s, assuming you die decades from now. \u201cYour dollars may have more of an impact when given during your lifetime rather than upon your passing,\u201d Jinsky said.\nSecond, it gives you an opportunity to support them in ways that are meaningful to you.\n\u201cAnchor a gift in your values. Your money speaks for you. Make sure it says what you mean,\u201d said Williams. When his own father became ill, he wanted to give money to his grandchildren and wanted it used for education, so he set up 529 plans for them. But he also wrote each child a personal note, expressing how proud he was of them and how important education had been in his life. \u201cIt was the happiest I\u2019ve seen him. He died three months later,\u201d Williams said.\nThird, if your estate is large and likely subject to tax after death in your state, if not at the federal level (where individuals canexemptup to $13.99 million this year and $15 million next year) giving gifts can reduce your taxable estate.\nIf you have an adult child who regularly overspends, mismanages loans or has anaddiction, think hard before helping.\nYou might\ufeffnot want to bail them out if doing so would just reinforce their bad habits. \u201cIn an ideal world, you\u2019re supporting assets and not repairing liabilities,\u201d Williams said. \u201cGenerosity ideally doesn\u2019t create dependency.\u201d\nBut you might want to help if part of your child\u2019s predicament isn\u2019t necessarily their fault \u2013 for instance, they\u2019re saddled with unexpectedmedical debtor have a disability.\nIf you do decide to help but worry the money won\u2019t be handled well, you can pay a given expense directly.\n\u201cLook for as many avenues that you can to benefit the child but not put financial means into their hands,\u201d Jinsky said.\nMake an annual gift:In any given year you may give up to a certain amount \u2013 it\u2019s $19,000 this year and next \u2013 to as many individuals as you choose. That amount doubles to $38,000 if you\u2019re making the gift with your spouse.\nThe money is tax-free to the recipient. And so long as the amount you give to any one person doesn\u2019t exceed the $19,000 cap, it won\u2019t count against your federal lifetimegift tax exemption\u2013 which is as high as the estate tax exemption.\nIf your gift does exceed the cap, but you\u2019re nowhere near maxing out your lifetime exemption amount, you won\u2019t owe tax on the excess but you will have to file agift tax return.\nNote that once you give the money you cannot control how it will be used.  \u201cThe most difficult part for parents in gifting that amount is a little bit of \u2018Let go and let God,\u2019\u201d Jinsky said.\nPay expenses directly:The bill you pay for your child\u2019s or grandchild\u2019s medical or educational expenses does not count as a gift. \u201cParents can make payments of any amounts directly to the institution if it is for education or medical expenses,\u201d Jinsky said.\nBut any other money you use to pay their expenses \u2013 eg, your child\u2019s mortgage or credit card debt \u2013 will count as a gift and issubject to the now-$19,000 annual exclusion.\nEstablish a trust:Atrustis a more complicated way to gift money, Jinsky noted. But it can be designed to pay out in ways best tailored to your adult child\u2019s or grandchild\u2019s circumstance and to protect the assets in it from being drained. For instance, if the adult child is in a bad marriage, has creditors chasing them or has special needs.\n\u201cTypically, the purpose of the trust is for the parent to name a trustee to retain control over the assets to protect and preserve them,\u201d she said. \u201cIn many instances a parent will choose to never have the trust distribute outright but instead remain intact for the child\u2019s entire lifetime.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/30\/business\/making-financial-gifts-to-adult-children-grandchildren","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"A guide to financial sanity now","date":"2025-05-01","body":"The first 100 days of the second Trump administration upended a lot of things \u2014 not least of which was what investors, businesses and consumers thought they knew about the US economy.\nAs a result of President Donald Trump\u2019spunitive tariffs regime, economists across the ideological spectrum say the breadth and scope of the tariffs are likely to throw the US economy into reverse and harm Americans financially.\nRelated articleUS economy goes into reverse from Trump\u2019s abrupt policy shifts\nThe latest economic data suggests the economy is indeed weakening, though not yet under water. The annualized rate of economic growthtook a nosedivein the first quarter, mostly due to a surge in imports ahead of tariffs taking effect. But the so-called \u201ccore\u201d growth rate, a gauge of underlying demand in the economy, rose slightly.\nConsumer spending slowed in the first quarter overall butsoared in Marchas Americans hoped to get ahead ofthe tariffs. And government spending fell sharply. Meanwhile, first-quarter inflation accelerated, even though it cooled somewhat in the month of March. And private-sector employers added far fewer jobs in April than expected, according to data from payroll processor ADP.\nThen of course, there were big downward swings in stocks in March and April. The USstock market turned in its worst performancefor thefirst 100 daysof any presidential term in more than half a century.\nSo, how can a normal, busy, not-in-charge-of-the-world person financially protect themselves in the midst of all the churn?\nHere are some top suggestions drawn from several stories we\u2019ve done in recent weeks that may help you feel a little more financially secure in the months ahead \u2014 and less at the mercy of the markets, Trump\u2019s policies and geopolitics.\nYou can\u2019t prevent negative events in life, but you can control how you respond to them (at least somewhat).\nFor instance, you can\u2019t know for sure whether there will be a recession or if you\u2019ll be laid off. But you can make a plan for how to handle such worst-case scenarios, which can reduce your stress if they occur.\nConsider your income sources.If you\u2019re laid off, will you get severance and unemployment benefits? (To get an idea of how much you\u2019ll receive and when, check your employer\u2019s severance policy and your state\u2019s labor department site.)\nAnd do you have a skill or side gig that can earn you money between jobs? If so, what can you do now to make that a realistic possibility should the time come?\nArrange for financial backstops.Where can you get cash quickly if you need it? Ideally you\u2019d want an emergency fund with three to six months of living expenses if you\u2019re single, or nine to 12 months if you\u2019re the primary breadwinner for your family or have very high expenses.\nIf you don\u2019t have that much set aside and can\u2019t save more now, you might take out a home-equity line of credit if you own your home, since you could tap that in an emergency.\nAnother lever you can pull is spending. Get a clear sense of how much you spend currently on needs (e.g., housing, food and health insurance) versus wants (e.g., entertainment and other regular discretionary purchases, etc.). Doing so will provide a roadmap of how you can cut back if you must.\n(More ideashere.)\nYou can\u2019t avoid losses altogether when there are major stock downturns. But you can minimize them by having a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, which will be far less volatile and risky than an all-stocks portfolio. But also:\nRelated articleS&P 500, Dow close out April in the red as economy contracts for first time since 2022\nKeepperspective:There will be a lot of stock downturns over the course of your life. If you have 20-plus years until you will need money from your portfolio, big drops can be buying opportunities since stocks become cheaper.\nFor any money you will need in less than five years, invest that portion more conservatively \u2014 in short-term Treasuries, money market funds or FDIC-insured certificates of deposit.\nIf you\u2019re in ornear retirement, have one to two years\u2019 worth of living expenses invested in high-yield savings accounts \u2014 or cash-equivalent assets like short-term bonds \u2014 so you will never have to make withdrawals from your portfolio when stocks are down.\nDon\u2019t run to cash:The last thing you want to do in a big downturn is liquidate all your holdings and go to cash. That\u2019s because you will: A) lock in your losses; and B) compromise your nest egg\u2019s chances of growing sufficiently because no one is good atcalling the \u201cbottom\u201dof the market, meaning you won\u2019t know when to \u201cget back in.\u201d So chances are you will miss at least part of the recovery when it occurs.\nLook abroad for a little bump:This year, for the first time in many years, non-US stocks haveoutperformed US stocksbecause their valuations are lower and there has been heightened concern about US policies.\nIf you\u2019re in a target date fund, you may already have exposure to world markets. But if you\u2019re not, you may want to consider investing up to a third of your stock allocation in a low-cost world markets ex-US index fund. So if you have a portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, allocate up to 20% (one third of 60%) in international equities and put the rest in US stocks.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/01\/business\/how-to-help-finances-wellness","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Worried how to pay for college? Here\u2019s how to maximize your chances of getting the aid you need","date":"2025-05-18","body":"Getting into college can be hard.\nBut figuring out how to finance college so that neither parent nor child are left financially hard up? It\u2019s a new, highly annoying level of hard \u2014 at least if you hope to get an adequate financial aid package to supplement your and your child\u2019s college savings.\nFor any parent with a child in the 8th, 9th or 10th grade, now is the time to strategize how to maximize your access to both merit-based and need-based financial aid.\nThe cost of one year in college for one child \u2014 never mind two or more \u2014 is always eye-popping.\nFor this academic year (2024-2025) theaverageannual sticker pricefor a private, four-year college including tuition, housing, food, supplies, transportation and the always mysterious \u201cother\u201d is $62,990, according to the College Board.\nFor a four-year program at a public state university, the average came to $29,910 for in-state students and $49,080 for out-of-staters.\nThe good news: The\u201cnet\u201d price of a year of collegecan be much less, once you account for federal and school aid (both need-based and merit-based), coupled with scholarships and federally subsidized loans.\nBut just how much less depends, among other things, on your family income, how well you\u2019ve strategized withdrawing your savings for college, and \u2014 this is key, college experts say \u2014 whether your child\u2019s academic performance puts them in a school\u2019s top 25% of incoming freshmen.\nAnother consideration may soon be what Congress will do. House Republicans are considering aproposalthat would, among other things, end thesubsidized loanprogram for undergraduates and change the rules for gettingPell grants.\nWhether the proposal makes it into law is anyone\u2019s guess. But if it does, it will change the calculus for how families fund a college education.\nThat, coupled with confusion over the Trump administration\u2019s expresseddesire to dismantlethe Department of Education, has in some ways made Beth Walker\u2019s job a little easier.\nAs the author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d who counsels families on how to financially plan for college years before a child applies anywhere, Walker said, \u201cIt\u2019s never been as easy for me to advocate for taking back control of this purchase \u2014 and thinking about it with a consumer mindset.\u201d\nThere are several things you and your kids can do ahead of time to put you in the best position to pay for college.\nGet good grades and test scores:The better your children do scholastically, the more likely it is they will qualify for merit-based aid.\nA big key to unlocking merit aid is to get strong standardized test scores (e.g., on the SAT or ACT), said Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners.\nHe strongly advises students to study and take practice tests starting as early as middle school to improve their score before they take the official test in 11th or 12th grade.\nEarn college credits ahead of time:McKinnon also recommends that students try to earn college credits or advance placement in a subject while still in high school. Doing so may let them skip certain required college courses or even graduate early, thereby curbing the total cost for their degree.\nAmong the ways to get that leg up is to takeadvance placement coursesduring the school year, college courses during the summer or college-level examination program(CLEP) tests.\nCheck the colleges your child may be interested in attending to see what credits those schools will recognize.\nAt the very least, convey to your kids the value of getting their degree sooner rather than later. Roughly 22% of those earning bachelor\u2019s degrees take longer than that to graduate, according to the Education Data Initiative.\nBe clear-eyed about your budget:When your child is in 8th or 9th grade, start projecting the financial resources you will have available to pay for college.\nTodd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, created a free college budgetingcalculator called CostHerothat lets you input a detailed list of income, savings, expenses and likely federal loans and tax credits to consider when assessing what your family can reasonably afford to pay. It then gives you two budgets based on your inputs \u2014 one in which the parents incur no debt and one in which they do. The results will help you frame your thinking about where you might need to save more or spend less.\n\u201cYou can take the time when your student enters high school and get serious about planning for college. Or you can have the colleges and the government give you the plan they have and it\u2019s really expensive,\u201d Fothergill said.\nPlanning for more than one child in college at the same time:Say you have a 7th grader and a 9th grader. You will be dealing with college bills for six years, and doubly large ones during two of those years when both kids are in school simultaneously. So it pays to strategize especially carefully for those overlap years.\nYou want to minimize your income in the \u201cbase\u201d years \u2014 which is two years ahead of when your child matriculates, Fothergill said. It is information from those two years that is included on theFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, which is a key form schools consider when determining your aid package. So, for example, if you plan to sell stocks to help pay for tuition, don\u2019t sell them in that two-year window because it may artificially inflate your income during the base years and you may get less aid as a result.\nKnow too that recent changes to FAFSA rules mean that families with two or more kids in school at once get less of a break than they used to, Fothergill noted.\nAlso, not all schools make their aid decisions exclusively using FAFSA.Some usetheCSS profilefrom the College Board to determine how much institutional aid to give. And the rules governing how much a family is expected to contribute using the CSS differ from FAFSA\u2019s.\nSo, before applying anywhere, research what governs aid decisions at schools your child may want to attend. And get your child\u2019sStudent Aid Index number, which is generated by the FAFSA form once completed.\nStart looking for scholarships:There is a wide variety of scholarships available at the national, state and local levels and also at individual schools. So do some research to see which ones might be a good fit for your child. The College Board has afree toolthat can get you started.\nApply to colleges most likely to give you what you need:There are now many comprehensive, online sites likeNiche.comandDabima.comthat let you research every major aspect of a college relevant to potential applicants \u2014 from academics and financial aid to school culture \u2014 and assess how your child compares to the average student at a chosen school.\nNiche.com, for instance, provides users with the 25th to 75th percentile range of standardized test scores among students who\u2019ve been admitted. So if your child\u2019s score is above that range you\u2019ll know they would be in the top quartile. And Niche lets you see, based on GPA and test scores, how your child would rank, relative to accepted students. In addition, it offers a list of Best Value Colleges, which considers many factors, including net price for tuition room and board, student-faculty ratio, student reviews, return on investment for a degree and how likely the lowest-income students are to move up the economic ladder after graduation.\nBy the end of this year, Fothergill is planning to make another tool he created called ListHero available to consumers. It is currently used by educational consultants to identify the top list of schools that offer the best fit and education for their clients at the most affordable price for them.\nWhile students may still want to apply to \u201creach\u201d schools, it\u2019s important for families to realize that if their children do get in, it may be a very expensive ride if a child\u2019s academic performance lags that of fellow classmates at the school, Fothergill said. \u201cColleges don\u2019t invest [aid] money in the bottom quartile.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/18\/business\/paying-for-college","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The shutdown is complicating the Fed\u2019s ability to help the economy","date":"2025-10-22","body":"The Federal Reserve was already facing one of its most difficult battles, steering a shifting economy through a weakening labor market and stubborn inflation. The government shutdown just made that fight even harder.\nTo make determinations about its rate policy and other decisions to help the economy, the Fed relies heavily on official economic statistics that are collected and disseminated by the government. The shutdown has effectivelycut off access to that data\u2014 from the unemployment rate to retail sales \u2014 since the beginning of October.\nWith just one week to go before the Fed\u2019s next decision on interest rates, officials are flying partially blind as they assess whether the labor market requires additional support, after data through August showedthe weakest pace of hiring since 2010and rising unemployment among young Americans and minorities.\nIt\u2019s the latest wrinkle for policymakers as they tackle a continued attack from the Trump administration on their independence, an ongoing housing affordability crisis that the Fed doesn\u2019t have all the tools to fix, the potential effects of AI, persistent inflation, uncertainty around tariffs and a slowdown in the job market.\nIn the absence of government data, Fed officials have turned to other sources to gauge the labor market and consumer spending \u2014 two important drivers of the US economy and the focus of the Fed\u2019s so-called dual mandate to balance economic growth with keeping prices in check.\nThe problem is that government data is undisputedly the \u201cgold standard\u201d of how the world\u2019s largest economy is measured. Without it, the Fed\u2019s decision making is not fully informed. And the Fed might have even less access to private employment data this time around, after payroll software provider ADP ended its data-sharing agreement with the Fed in August, according toThe American Prospect.\n\u201cThe risk is that the Fed misjudges where the state of its dual mandate sits, whether inflation or the labor market is the bigger concern,\u201d Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at asset manager Glenmede, told CNN.\nThe last time Fed officials set monetary policy without key economic data was during the 2018-2019 shutdown. Minutes from the Fed\u2019sJanuary 2019 meetingshowed how officials turned to figures on card transactions and vehicles sales in the absence of the Commerce Department\u2019s monthly report on retail sales.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a data drought,\u201d New York Fed President John Williams told the New York Times in an interview published on October 9.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still getting a significant amount of data,\u201d he added, pointing to surveys from the Conference Board, the New York Fed and the Institute for Supply Management. Those surveys measure trends in prices, demand, production and overall economic activity.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday will release the Consumer Price Index for September, having recalled staff to ensure the report can be used as a basis forSocial Security\u2019s annual cost-of-living adjustments.\nStill, that leaves the Fed in the dark on the labor market\u2019s true health and trajectory. Economists widely agree that private-sector figures cannot fully replace government data, especially considering that the government\u2019s numbers serve as the benchmark for much of the private data.\nWith Social Security\u2019s COLA on the line, the Trump administration plans to release inflation data delayed by the shutdown\nThe Fed\u2019s main tool \u2014 its key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs more broadly \u2014 is particularly effective at making borrowing cheaper or more costly, depending on whether the Fed is trying to tamp down inflation or boost employment. So, it\u2019s pretty good at changing how much consumers demand goods and services.\nBut it does nothing to balance the \u201csupply\u201d side of the supply and demand equation, which is precisely what continues to drive up prices in some parts of the country, such as the Northeast.\nSales of previously owned homes have been sluggish for the third-straight year, and persistently elevated mortgage rates have certainly played a role in keeping buyers on the sidelines. But so has the housing shortage.\n\u201cSales of affordable homes are constrained by the lack of inventory,\u201d National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement last month.\nThe Fed has already acknowledged that there\u2019s only so much it can do to alleviate America\u2019s housing woes.\n\u201cThere is a long-term housing shortage,\u201d Powell said in a news conference after the Fed\u2019s July meeting. \u201cThis is not something the Fed can help with.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive bid to reshape global trade has forced many businesses to put hiring plans on ice as they wait to see how everything plays out. And at the same time, many companies are actively trying to figure out how to implement AI into their operations.\nThe result: unusually weak hiring, largely driven by businesses feeling paralyzed. But for some workers, it\u2019s also because of AI.\nThere\u2019s no jobs report today. So here\u2019s what we know about the US labor market\n\u201cThe labor market has been frozen up because people are just having a hard time making decisions,\u201d Laura Ullrich, an economist at Indeed, told CNN. \u201cAnd AI is certainly having some impact on entry-level tech jobs.\u201d\nThe Fed\u2019s rate cuts should function like a tide that lifts all boats by making borrowing cheaper, allowing companies to expand head count. But that might not be enough to shore up demand for workers in roles that are increasingly being automated by AI.\nAdditionally, while the Fed is poised to lower rates further, \u201cso long as economic uncertainty is high, it\u2019s hard to know exactly how many people you should hire,\u201d Ullrich said.\nThat sentiment is borne out by businesses in the manufacturing and services sectors surveyed by the Institute for Supply Management, who continue to express frustration over Trump\u2019s significant policy changes and their ensuing effects on demand and planning.\n\u201cClient demand in professional services remains steady, though decision-making timelines are lengthening due to continued economic uncertainty and interest-rate concerns,\u201d one business said in ISM\u2019s September services survey.\nThe Fed is set to announce its latest monetary policy decision at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting ending on October 29, with a post-meeting news conference by Chair Jerome Powell scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ET that day.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/22\/economy\/fed-interest-rates-govt-shutdown","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The benefits of keeping your investing life simple","date":"2025-10-22","body":"Are you suffering from decision fatigue? Do you have better things to do than oversee a complex portfolio and keep up with the latest on Wall Street? Do you just want to do as little as possible when it comes to investing but still have the money you need to meet your goals?\nIf so, good news: Your exhaustion and disinterest might make you a successful investor if you adopt a portfolio strategy we\u2019ll call KISS (Keep It Simple and Smart).\nThe key to the KISS strategy is to not waste effort trying to select the \u201cbest\u201d of anything \u2013 stock funds, managers, complicated sector plays. And, instead, to feel confident you can do well enough foryour individual goalsby sticking with a few low-cost funds over time that track overall market performance.\nWhy? Because, it turns out, \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult to beat the market,\u201d said Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar.\nIndeed, data from Morningstar suggest most actively managed funds don\u2019t.\nResearchers compared their performance after fees to a composite of passively managed index funds and exchange-traded funds.\n\u201cJust 21% of active strategies survived and beat their passive counterparts over the 10 years through June 2025,\u201d they wrote in amid-year reportabout Morningstar\u2019s Active\/Passive Barometer.\nAs just one example of how actively managed funds may disappoint, Morningstar found that over 20 years, only 7.1% of large cap blend funds \u2013 which invest in both growth and value stocks and might compare their performance to the S&P 500 \u2013 performed better than index funds in the same category.\nIf the bulk of your money is in a workplace retirement plan like a 401(k), chances are you will have the option to invest in atarget-date retirement fund.\nSuch a fund allocates your money across other stock and bond funds \u2013 often index funds \u2013 to achieve an allocation that best suits your time horizon to retirement. So for someone who\u2019s 40 they might be in a 2050 or 2055 target date fund.\nThe fund\u2019s allocation will grow more conservative (less in stocks, more in bonds) as you near your expected retirement year.\n\u201cA target date fund can be a great option. It builds in portfolio diversification and an asset mix targeted to your age and retirement date,\u201d Arnott said.\nTarget date funds: What are they and are they right for you?\nIf you don\u2019t have a target date fund, or don\u2019t like the one available in your plan, consider investing instead in three broad index funds and adjust how much you invest in each according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\u201cThe average person probably will get better results with a target-date fund. But if you want a slightly more hands-on approach you could put together a basic portfolio of US and international stocks plus investment-grade bonds. Having exposure to those three asset classes is all you really need,\u201d she said.\nBeyond retirement, for any investing you\u2019re doing to meet intermediate-term goals with a five- to 10-year horizon, she suggests putting money into a high-quality intermediate-term bond index fund or a low-cost, actively managed one, since this is one arena in which actives have had a reasonably good track record against their benchmarks. Or you might also consider a low-cost, moderate-risk allocation fund of funds \u2013 which invests in both stocks and bonds.\nJust as having fewer but better clothes in an organized closet can reduce your decision fatigue about what to wear, adopting a KISS strategy with just one or a few, low-cost funds can reduce the stress of managing your investments.\nWith a simple, streamlined portfolio, you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re invested in.\nIt will be easier to review \u2013 which you should do once a year to make sure the way your money is allocated still reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon.\nAnd your portfolio will be easier to explain to a spouse or adult child, who may help you manage it if you become unable to do so alone, or who will eventually inherit it.\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older and my financial situation has gotten more complicated, I\u2019ve come to appreciate the value of simplicity more,\u201d Arnott said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of value in having a portfolio that is easier for someone to take over when you\u2019re gone. Or if you\u2019re anolder adult with a cognitive impairment.\u201d\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, having a simpler portfolio may make it easier to assess whether youneed to savemore now. Because no matter how well your investments do, if you aren\u2019t saving sufficiently, the best returns in the world won\u2019t get you where you need to go.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/22\/business\/simplified-investment-strategy-benefits","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s tax and spending law is a short-term win but long-term headache for Wall Street","date":"2025-07-17","body":"President Donald Trump\u2019s signature tax and spending legislation is providing short-term clarity for Wall Street \u2014 but fueling concerns about the long-term health of the US economy, investors say.\nThe \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d which Trumpsigned into lawon July 4, is a positive for investors because of the certainty it provides for markets. But the bill is set toworsen the nation\u2019s debt burdenover time, according to forecasts, which could put the government\u2019s finances and the economy on shakier grounds.\nFor Wall Street, the legislation is not expected to spur growth or provide much of a boost to markets. Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, said the law is not stimulative like Trump\u2019s first-term tax cuts, and coupled with tariffs, it\u2019s not expected provide a meaningful tailwind for markets,\nRelated articleHere\u2019s who stands to gain from the \u2018big, beautiful bill.\u2019 And who may struggle\n\u201cThere are very modest tax benefits that go into some areas, but the more important components are ultimately cutbacks in support for households that are already kind of struggling,\u201d Green said. \u201cThis is a very regressive tax program.\u201d\nThe package also includes some worries for investors because it does not address America\u2019s accumulating debt load. The law\u2019s passing has drawn ire from economists and deficit hawks who havewarned about the debt-to-economic growth ratioand the potential for a future debt crisis.\n\u201cMarkets had already priced in much of the expected fiscal and economic impact,\u201d investors at UBS Global Wealth Management said in a July 4 note. \u201cHowever, the longer-term outlook is clouded by persistent deficits.\u201d\nInvestors this year have been on a roller coaster ride as markets dropped amid trade uncertainty and have soared torecord highs. As Congress deliberated Trump\u2019s bill, it was another source of uncertainty.\nSigning the bill into law resolved that uncertainty, Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got tariff noise, but at least we don\u2019t have to worry about something terrible happening with the tax bill,\u201d Hatfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s relief. It\u2019s more like the absence of pain than it is pleasure.\u201d\nThe tax cuts from Trump\u2019s first term were set to expire at the end of the year, which would have resulted in a massive tax hike. Passing the bill, which extends those cuts, averts that scenario, Hatfield said.\nThe bill also raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, giving lawmakers relief about the impending \u201cX date,\u201d when the government was set to hit its borrowing limit.\nFor the stock market, however, there isn\u2019t much juice in the legislation, Hatfield said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably slightly good for investors, but not significant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t view it as being stimulative to the economy.\u201d\nTrump during his campaign proposedlowering the corporate tax ratefrom 21% to 15%. That proposal did not make it into the final legislation, which held the corporate tax rate steady at 21%.\nInvestors at UBS said the bill\u2019s passage provides a \u201cmodest fiscal boost for 2026,\u201d noting other tax cuts and spending reforms \u201cmay support earnings growth at the margin.\u201d\nWall Street analysts haveraised concernsthis year about global investors\u2019 appetite for holding US debt. Those nerves were exacerbated by the size of Trump\u2019s bill.\nLong-term US debt, which is usually considered the safe, risk-free corner of the market, has come under scrutiny as the legislation is setto increase federal deficits.\nHigher deficits mean the government would have to issue more debt to finance its spending. An increase in the supply of government bonds coupled with a rising debt load could mean the need to offer higher rates to attract investors. Higher rates correspond to higher borrowing costs for Americans.\nRelated articleWall Street looks past US deficit concerns for now as investors snap up bonds\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been highlighting the precarious position of the US government\u2019s indebtedness for some time now, and, if left unchecked, we view debt as the single greatest risk to the \u2018special status\u2019 of the US in financial markets,\u201d investors at BlackRock said in a June 30 note.\nAlan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, said he doesn\u2019t expect significant short-term effects on the bond market, but in the long run, he expects the debt accumulation will push interest rates higher.\n\u201cIf the Fed\u2019s independence is compromised with theappointment of a new chair, I think this will exacerbate the upward impact on longer-maturity Treasury yields,\u201d Auerbach said.\nBrian Rehling, head of global fixed income strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he thinks Republicans lawmakers are hoping that thebill will spur growth, helping offset the rising debt burden. \u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d he said.\nSimilar to Auerbach, Rehling said he doesn\u2019t think there will be an immediate effect on the demand for bonds. But he expects yields to rise in the long run to compensate investors for the worsening fiscal outlook.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a moment in time where the bond vigilantes come out and you see kind of explosive moves to the upside in yields,\u201d Rehling said.\n\u201cThis is going to lead to the Treasury issuing more debt to cover these expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as supply comes onto the market, you would expect, just simple supply and demand, all else equal, that rates are going to have to increase to bring that demand into the market.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/17\/investing\/us-stock-market-trump-bill","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"How to benefit from the Fed\u2019s latest decision","date":"2025-06-18","body":"Still no movement.\nFor its fourth meeting in a row, the Federal Reserveopted to leave unchangedits key short-term interest rate \u2014 which influences a host of rates on consumer financial products and bank accounts across the United States.\nRelated articleThe Fed holds interest rates steady again as officials wait for the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs\nThat means thatonce again anyone with savings that they want to invest in stable, low-risk, interest-yielding assets isin luck. It may be especially good news for retirees, who are usually advised to keep a year\u2019s worth of living expenses in interest-bearing accounts so that they won\u2019t have to sell stocks from their portfolio when the market is down.\nStill, many investors may be eager for rate cuts \u2014 and the Fed is still forecasting that two might happen this year. Butgiven the volatile environment amid chaotic tariff policy, Middle East tensions and other stressors, any cuts in the next several months could signal the Fed isworriedabout a downturn in the economy, rather than lowering rates because inflation has fallen to the Fed\u2019s desired target.\n\u201cWe want interest rates to come down because inflation pressures are receding\u2026 not because the economy is rolling over and in need of Fed stimulus,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.\nThe annualinflation rate in Mayrose slightly to 2.4%.\nTo get steady, low-risk returns that can easily top that, you have a number of options.\nHigh-yield bank accounts:If you have cash for emergencies and cash for upcoming but-not-tomorrow expenses \u2014 eg, a trip at Christmas or tuition payments for 2026 \u2014 stash that money in a high-yield savings or money market account at an FDIC-insured online bank.\nRates on some of the best accounts now available range between 3.6% and 4.3%, according to Bankrate. That compares very favorably to the average savings rate across all banks, which was just 0.38% as of June 16, according to the FDIC.\nMoney market funds:If you don\u2019t want to shop around for good rates, and you\u2019re looking for another option in which to stash your emergency fund or money for upcoming expenses, a low-cost money market mutual fund can do the leg work for you.\nThe funds, which typically invest in short-term, low-risk Treasuries as well as municipal and corporate bonds, are not FDIC-insured. But they are considered very low risk because they almost always preserve your principal since they only rarely have fallen below $1 a share.\nAs of June 17, the average money market fund yielded 4.10 percent, according to Crane Data.\nCertificates of deposit:If you can afford to lock your money up for a fixed period of time(eg, 6 months, 18 months, 1 year, 3 years, etc.)FDIC-insured banks will offer you a higher return in a CD.\nRather than buy one directly from your bank, though, you will have more choice and are likely to get a much better rate if you buy a \u201cbrokered CD\u201d through your brokerage.\nAt Schwab.com, for instance, CD rates were averaging between 4.35% and 4.5% on Wednesday morning on durations between three months and five years.\nNote that you will owe federal, state and local taxes on your interest earnings.\nAnd you may be subject to a penalty if you take the money out before your CD\u2019s term ends.\nUS Treasuries:You can get a decent return and a tax break if you invest in US Treasury bills and notes.\nAgain, buying them through a brokerage where you already have an account may be more efficient than trying to buy them on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov.\nAs of Wednesday morning, average yields on Treasuries ranging in maturities from 3 months to 10 years were offering rates between 3.9% and 4.36%.\nIncome you make from your Treasuries will be taxed at the federal level but are generally exempt from state and local income taxes.\nAAA-rated municipal bonds:Muni bonds areanother tax-advantaged investment option for your cash. The interest you make on munis is exempt from federal income tax \u2014 and in some cases, state and local taxes too, if you buy a muni issued by your home state or city.\nBut you\u2019ll want to stick with top-rated munis (e.g., AAA) if your primary goal is to have an income-producing safe asset in your portfolio.\n\u201cThese securities generally offer strong credit fundamentals, allowing investors to maintain portfolios with robust credit strength,\u201d said Tom Kozlik, head of public policy and municipal strategy at Hilltop Securities.\nThe highest rated munis with maturities ranging from three months to 10 years offered interest yields between 2.36% and 4.51% on Wednesday morning at Schwab.com.\nTreasury inflation-protected securities:If you\u2019re very worried about inflation reducing the purchasing power of your savings over time you might consider putting some of the bond portion of your overall portfolio intoTreasury inflation-protected securities (aka TIPS), said Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at Schwab.\nThey\u2019re issued for terms of five, 10 and 30 years.\nThe value of the principal on a TIPS is tied to the Consumer Price Index, so if it rises during the time you\u2019re holding the security, you will get back more than you paid when the bond matures. If it\u2019s lower than the original amount you will get back your original amount, according toTreasuryDirect.gov.\nHere is a hypothetical example from Schwab: If you pay $1,000 for a new, five-year TIPS and inflation is 3% in the first year, the principal will grow to $1,030. If inflation is also 3% in the next year, the principal will grow by another $31 (i.e., 3% of $1,030) to total $1,061 and so on.\nIn the interim, the periodic interest payments you\u2019ll get while you hold the TIPS will be equal to the coupon rate multiplied by the value of the inflation-adjusted principal. So if a TIPS has a 2% coupon rate and the principal grows to $1,030 in the first year, you will be paid a total of $20.60 for that year.\nEven a few small rate cuts from the Fed \u2013 whenever they come \u2013 won\u2019t meaningfully reduce your debt load in many instances.\n\u201cBorrowing rates are high, with mortgage rates near 7 percent, many home equity lines of credit in double-digit interest rate territory, and the average credit card rate still above 20 percent,\u201d McBride said.\nCredit cards: The average credit card rate as of June 11 was 20.12%.\nYour best bet to minimize your interest payments regardless of what the Fed does is to try to get a 0% balance transfer card that will give you up to 21 months to pay off your balance interest free.\nHome loans:Mortgage rates move with the 10-year Treasury yield, which is driven by economic factors such as inflation and growth, and expectations of the Fed\u2019s future moves.\nFor the week ending June 18, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.81%, according to Freddie Mac. That\u2019s below the 7.04% registered in mid-January but above the 6.69% 52-week average.\nAs for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and loans (HELs), the average HELOC rate was 8.22% as of June 11, whereas the average rates on five, 10- and 15-year HELS were between 8.25% and 8.4%, according to Bankrate.\nWith rates showing no signs of dropping significantly and the threat of tariffs already increasingraw material coststo build new homes, if you\u2019re in the market for a home you can do several things to reduce the financial hit of buying one, according toBankrate. Among them: Make sure to have the best credit score possible to qualify for a lower loan rate. And shop around for the most advantageous mortgage.\nCar loans:Rates on car loans haven\u2019t moved much over the past year, according to data from Edmunds.com.\nThe average APR for a new car loan was 7.3% in May, the same as it was a year earlier. On used car loans, the rate fell slightly to 11% from 11.5%.\nBut loan amounts grew by roughly $1,800 in that time period, to $42,884 on new car loans and $29,114 on used car loans.\nTo get the best deal going forward \u201cshop around for a loan with the same rigor as (your) car search,\u201d said Joseph Yoon, Edmunds\u2019 consumer insights analyst.\nUltimately, though, with both prices and interest rates elevated, \u201cthe best bet for reducing the loan burden is to borrow the least amount possible,\u201d Yoon noted.\nGiven the threat of tariff-based pricing and lower-than-usual inventories of used cars, trading your car in could offer you a big benefit when negotiating the price of your next car, he added.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/18\/economy\/benefit-fed-interest-rate-decision-june","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"How to protect your money when markets get rocky","date":"2025-04-18","body":"Americans are nervous about their investment portfolios, and it\u2019s easy to see why, given escalating trade tensions and gloomy economicforecasts.\nThe probability of a US recession within the next 12 months has jumped to 45% from 25% last month \u2014 the highest since December 2023, a recentReuters pollfound. \ufeffPresident Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, which have sparked a global trade war, have prompted worries about inflation, slower growth and layoffs.\nWelcome to a \u201crisk-off\u201d environment, a time when investors pull money from volatile assets like stocks and search for safer ground.\n\u201cUncertainty couldn\u2019t be any higher right now,\u201d said Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner and founder of\ufeffwealth management firm Bone Fide Wealth. \u201cImagine being the CFO of a Fortune 100 company trying to plan for the year, let alone multiple years.\u201d\nBut he said investors who aren\u2019t CFOs of multinational corporations don\u2019t need a finance degree to protect their money. They just need a plan.\nWhen markets get choppy, it\u2019s tempting to hit the panic button. But financial experts say the smartest move you can make is pause \u2014 and plan.\n\u201cShort-term volatility is part of the game,\u201d Boneparth said. \u201cThe worst thing you can do is sell at the bottom or make an emotional decision that sets you back for years.\u201d\nIn other words: Pulling your money out during a downturn can lock in losses, and you may miss the market\u2019s biggest recovery days, which often drive long-term gains.\nCatherine Valega, a certified financial planner with Green Bee Advisory in Boston, agrees with taking a moment to think things through. She suggests that investors work with financial advisors who can help with their long-term plans.\n\u201cI like to say we set the guardrails, like a GPS for their financial life,\u201d she said.\nShe also recommends continuing toinvest, especially for people who work and have 401(k)s. For those without a 401(k), you can set up automated investments, Valega said.\nIn shaky markets, many investors turn to cash equivalents \u2014 think high-yield savings accounts, US Treasury bills, money market funds or CDs. These are typically insured or backed by the government, offering peace of mind.\n\u201cCash gives you flexibility and control,\u201d Boneparth said. \u201cBut going all to cash out of fear? That\u2019s often the worst move.\u201d\nFixed-income investments like bonds are another option, though Boneparth cautions that some have significant risk. Even the S&P 500, which is often seen as a solid long-term investment, comes with risk.\n\u201cWarren Buffett says to invest in the S&P 500, but he also says to do it for 10 years or more,\u201d Boneparth noted. \u201cRisk and reward go hand in hand.\u201d\nIf investors are feeling uneasy, there are ways to reduce risk without abandoning the market entirely.\nStart by building a solid cash reserve, ideally at least three to six months of living expenses. \u201cThat gives you the cushion to handle emergencies or opportunities without touching your investments,\u201d Boneparth said.\nOnce investors have built up a large enough cash reserve, it\u2019s smart to diversify, Valega said. US Treasury bills, money market accounts or other low-risk cash alternatives can help spread out risk without compromising safety, though again investors don\u2019t have to put all their money here.\nAnother smart move? Rebalancing your portfolio. That means adjusting your mix of stocks, bonds and cash to realign with your goals and risk tolerance. For some, that could mean taking advantage of discounted stock prices to buy more \u2014 what some investors call \u201cbuying the dip.\u201d\nNo one can predict when markets rise or fall. What matters most is staying consistent and disciplined, Boneparth said.\n\u201cInvesting isn\u2019t about picking the perfect stock,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about doing the boring stuff consistently over a long period of time. That\u2019s what makes it hard.\u201d\nIn rocky markets, that kind of calm and measured approach might be your greatest asset.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/18\/money\/how-to-protect-your-money-safe-havens","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Money moves to make now that the Fed has cut rates (again)","date":"2025-10-29","body":"For the second time this year, the Federal Reserve on Wednesdaydecided to lowerits key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted during a briefing with reporters on Wednesday that it isnot a foregone conclusionthat the central bank will opt for third rate cut this year at its upcoming December meeting.\nFor now, though, the Fed\u2019s move on Wednesday will affect various consumer savings and lending rates throughout the economy.\nHow? In brief, it may make it a little harder \u2014 but still possible \u2014 to find attractive,inflation-beatingyields for your savings if you comparison shop. And on your debts, the Fed\u2019s moves may save you some money but not nearly as much as your taking advantage of other options. More on all that below.\nEven if the rates available today move down a bit given the Fed\u2019s latest move, there are still plenty of low-risk options that let you grow your savings and protect your purchasing power.\nFed cuts interest rates for the second time this year\nOnline high-yield savings accounts:Online high-yield savings accounts at many small FDIC-insured banks are still offering yields north of 4%, far higher than the 0.1% you might earn on a traditional bank savings account. Why? Because the online players are competing to attract deposits.\nIn fact, while many bank account rates typically follow the Fed\u2019s moves quickly, the online high-yield savings accounts rates haven\u2019t fallen as much as the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate. \u201cSome dropped around 10 basis points, but they haven\u2019t fallen 25 basis points since (the Fed\u2019s cut) last month,\u201d said Ken Tumin, co-founder of DepositQuest.com. In the wake of a full percentage point of cuts by the Fed in 2024, Tumin said, many online high-yield accounts fell by only 60 to 70 basis points.\nMoney market accounts and funds:Many money market bank accounts at FDIC-insured banks were offering rates of between 3.40% and 4.25% ahead of the Fed meeting, according to Bankrate data.\nAnd money market mutual funds \u2014 which are not FDIC insured but nonetheless are considered very low risk for cash \u2014 were paying an average of 3.92% as of Tuesday, according to Crane Data.\nWhile the funds\u2019 rates will come down in the coming weeks, they may not do so by quite as much as the Fed rate. For instance, the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund currently has a 7-day yield of 4.05%.But that is only 15 basis points below the 4.19% it was offering in September right before the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points, Tumin said.\nCertificates of deposit:On Schwab.com, the best rates for CDs with terms of anywhere from three months to five years were between 3.6% and 3.95% on Wednesday. Those rates may come down some in the coming days, but they will still exceed the latest 3% inflation reading.\nNormally, if you withdraw money from a CD before it matures, you forfeit some of your interest earnings. But some banks offer what are called no-penalty CDs for up to 13 months. You get to lock in your rate for that time period but can take the money sooner without penalty. One such no-penalty CD is currently on offer by Marcus for 3.95%.\nYou can buy a CD direct from banks, some of which are offering very attractive rates north of 4%, Tumin said. Or you can buy CDs from banks around the country through your brokerage \u2014 which give you the option to trade it before the term ends, which could result in a capital gain or loss depending on the price the day you sell. Ideally, if you plan to hold a CD to term, try to find one that is not callable, meaning the issuer won\u2019t recall it before the term ends.\nTreasuries and municipal bonds:On Wednesday ahead of the Fed\u2019s announcement,T-bills(with durations up to 52 weeks) had average yields ranging from 3.63% to 3.81% perofferings on Schwab.com.\nTreasurynotes(with durations from two to 10 years) had average yields between 3.50% and 3.99%.\nAnd AAA-ratedmunicipal bonds(with durations up to 4 years) had rates from 2.43% to 3.46%.\nAfter the Fed\u2019s meeting, bond prices fell,pushing yields higher.\nHow much interest you actually net from cash-equivalent and fixed-income investments like CDs and federal and local government bonds depends on how they\u2019re taxed. CD interest is taxed at the federal, state and local levels, while yields on Treasury bills, notes and bonds are usually exempt from state and local income taxes. Municipal bond interest, meanwhile, is usually exempt from federal income taxes \u2014 and may be completely tax free if you buy a muni issued by your home state, city or county.\nSo, when deciding between CDs and bonds,compare the after-tax yieldyou\u2019d get in order to figure out which offers you the best deal.\nOr, if you don\u2019t want to buy individual bonds through your brokerage or viaTreasuryDirect.gov, you might consider a low-cost intermediate-term Treasury bond index fund.\nHow much debt you choose to take on, how quickly you plan to pay it off and how high you can get your credit score before applying for a loan may save you more money than a small rate cut or two from the Fed.\nCredit cards:Take credit cards. The average rate is still a hair north of 20%, according to Bankrate. And, per Lending Tree, the average rate on anewcredit card is 24.19%.\nSo, if you\u2019re carrying debt from month to month and paying double-digit interest rates \u2013 never mind 20% or more \u2013 forget the Fed. \u201c(By) getting a 0% balance transfer credit card or even simply calling your lender andasking for a lower rate, you can find significantly bigger reductions than you\u2019re likely to ever get from the Fed,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at Lending Tree.\nMortgages and home equity loans:Rates on mortgages track movements in the 10-year Treasury yield, which moves in anticipation of Fed rate decisions and other economic indicators.\nThe average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has fallen by nearly a full percentage point since mid-January (when it was 7.04%). Last week, it came in at 6.19%.\nFor homebuyers, that drop alone on a $350,000 mortgage amounts to savings of nearly $197 a month.\nAnd for those who already have a mortgage, if your current fixed rate is at least a percentage point higher than what you could get by refinancing, \u201cmake a move to refi,\u201d said Stephen Kates, a certified financial planner and Bankrate financial analyst.\nAs for borrowing against home equity, lending rates have been coming down slowly. As of last week, the average rate on a home equity loan was 8.11% and the variable rate on home equity line of credit (HELOC) was 7.85%, according to Bankrate. They will move lower still over the next few months.\nIf you already have a variable rate HELOC or are getting a new one, your rate will automatically adjust downward.\nIf you\u2019re applying for a new fixed-rate home equity loan, you can do more to lower your own rate than just depending on small cuts from the Fed.\n\u201cThe length of your home equity loan will impact your rate. The longer the loan, the higher the rate,\u201d Kates said.\nJust as important, he added, is to focus on improving your credit score, unless it\u2019s already excellent. \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of a renovation in six months, that\u2019s all you should be thinking about. It\u2019s the biggest and quickest way to take a rate down.\u201d\nCar loans:You can do more to make a car affordablethan a quarter-point cut by the Fed can.\nAs of September, the average APR was 7% on loans for new vehicles and 10.7% on used ones, while average monthly payments came to $761 and $570, respectively, according to data from Edmunds.com, which also offers astate-by-state breakdownof average rates.\nTo really keep yourmonthly paymentsin check, improve your credit score to qualify for the best rate and don\u2019t buy more car than you need.\n\u201cAffordability is still amajor hurdlefor many shoppers, but the end of the year has traditionally been a popular time to buy. Dealers are eager to clear out 2025 model-year inventory, and November\u2019s Black Friday promotions typically kick off a stretch of holiday deals,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds.com head of insights.\nIf you\u2019re tempted by low-APR promotions, their terms may be capped at 48 or 60 months. So make sure you can manage those monthly payments. Longer loan terms may offer lower monthly payments, but you will end up paying more in interest in the long run.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/29\/business\/interest-rate-cut-fed-money-moves","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Trump signs executive order blocking states from enforcing their own regulations around AI","date":"2025-12-11","body":"President Donald Trump on Thursdaysigned an executive orderthat blocks states from enforcing their own regulations around artificial intelligence and instead aims to create a \u201csingle national framework\u201d for AI.\n\u201cThis is an executive order that orders aspects of your administration to take decisive action to ensure that AI can operate within a single national framework in this country, as opposed to being subject to state level regulation that could potentially cripple the industry,\u201d White House aide Will Scharf said of the executive order in the Oval Office.\nThe order could have far-reaching effects on US efforts to dominate the nascent technology, which has already become a significant part of the economy and the stock market but which also still remains untested in many ways.\nDavid Sacks, the White House crypto and AI czar, said during the signing ceremony that the executive order would have the administration create a \u201cfederal framework\u201d on AI in conjunction with Congress.\n\u201cIn the meantime, this EO gives your administration tools to push back on the most onerous and excessive state regulations,\u201d Sacks said. Notably, Sacks emphasized that the administration will not push back on state-level regulation around child safety and AI. He later wrote in a social media post that the EO \u201cdoes not mean the Administration will challenge every State AI law.\u201d\nCongress killed an earlier attempt by Republicans to prevent states from regulating AI in July. The US Senate voted nearly unanimously to remove a 10-year moratorium on the enforcement of state artificial intelligence regulations from Trump\u2019s sweeping domestic policy bill before the bill passed.\nLawmakers alsodeclined to addan AI moratorium to the National Defense Authorization Act, despite Trump\u2019s suggestion that they do so.\nLeaders in Silicon Valley, such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have argued that navigating a patchwork of state regulations could slow down innovation and affect America\u2019s competitiveness in the global AI race with China, which they say will have implications for the economy and national security.\nCritics worry the deregulation push could allow AI companies to evade accountability should their tools harm consumers.\nArtificial intelligence is already subject to little overall oversight as it extends into more areas of American life \u2014 from personal communications and relationships to health care and policing.\nIn the absence of broad federal legislation, some states have passed laws to address potentially risky and harmful uses of AI, such as the creation of misleading deepfakes and discrimination in hiring.\nBut the debate over how to regulate AI has caused schisms not only in the industry but also within the conservative movement and Republican party.\nOn one side are figures in the administration like Sacks and Vice President JD Vance, who push for a lighter touch regulatory framework. On the other are figures such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who have been vocal about suppoting state-level regulation, arguing those guardrails are needed for the fast-moving technology.\nBrad Carson, president of Americans for Responsible Innovation and a leader of the pro-AI regulation super PAC Public First, said in a statement that the executive order will \u201chit a brick wall in the courts.\u201d\nCarson added that the order \u201cdirectly attacks the state-passed safeguards that we\u2019ve seen vocal public support for over the past year, all without any replacement at the federal level.\u201d\nIn contrast, Collin McCune, head of government affairs at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, called the order an \u201cincredibly important first step\u201d but called on Congress to fill the regulatory vacuum.\n\u201cStates have an important role in addressing harms and protecting people, but they can\u2019t provide the long-term clarity or national direction that only Congress can deliver,\u201d he wrote on X.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/11\/tech\/ai-trump-states-executive-order","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The administration\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d under Elon Musk has aggressivelydisrupted the functioning and moraleat federal government agencies andinterrupted approved paymentsto various programs domestically and abroad. There have beenshoot-first-aim-latermass firings of federal workersandstop-work orders, which have generated a slew of lawsuits against those in the government and DOGE.\nAnd now many people question whether the US is \u2014 or soon will be \u2014 in aconstitutional crisis, given that the administration hasrepeatedly arguedthat the courts shouldn\u2019t have power over the presidency.\nLove or hate what\u2019s happening, there has been financial fallout from all the uncertainty and chaos generated.\nUS stock indexes have been down \u2013 at certain points evenin correction mode, defined as 10% below their recent peaks.Goldhas hit record highs.Consumer spendingandconsumer confidencehave dropped. And economists \u2014 who have recently lowered their US growth forecasts \u2014 now worry that what has been a strong, stable US economyruns a higher riskof entering a period ofstagflationorrecession.\nIf any or all of this has made you anxious about your finances, you\u2019re not alone. No one can predict whether the fallout so far will be temporary or longer lasting. Nor can anyone predict the next thing the administration might do that will further unsettle investors, consumers, businesses or other countries.\nBut you can counter your financial anxiety now by doing four things:\nExternal economic and geopolitical events are beyond your control. As is the fallout from them.\nBut it can help to \u201clook at what you do have control over,\u201d said Mari Adam, a certified financial planner and founder of Mari Talks Money.\nRelated articleFed leaves rates unchanged. But here are changes you can make to earn more on savings or pay less on debt\nFor instance, you have control over what you save, what you decide to spend on big purchases like a home, how you invest and how much money you set aside or arrange to have available to you in case of emergency.\nImagine various worst-case scenarios for your finances. Then come up with a contingency plan for how you would handle them, Adam suggested.\nHaving a plan can relieve you of having to make possibly ill-advised decisions should the worst happen. \u201cYour brain isn\u2019t geared to make rational decisions under stress,\u201d she noted. \u201cTake decisions away from your primitive fight-or-flight brain.\u201d\nOne worst-case scenario may be that you or your spouse loses a job. Beyond any potential severance or unemployment benefits you might receive, what other liquid assets do you have access to?\nIf you don\u2019t have six months to a year\u2019s worth of emergency savings set aside, can you commit to putting a little more aside every month?\nIf not, what other sources of cash could you  tap? For example, Adam said, if you have a mortgage, you might consider taking out a home equity line of credit and only using it in case of emergency.\nOr if you\u2019re paying tuition for your child at a private high school or college, find out whether the school would be willing to adjust your financial aid should your circumstances change, said Adam Grossman, a chartered financial analyst and founder of the fixed-fee wealth management firm Mayport.\nConsider, too, whether you\u2019re adequately insured for things that can go sideways in life. \u201cInsurance is critical. It\u2019s risk management,\u201d Grossman said.\nHe recommends clients with children at home have life insurance and disability insurance to cover the family in case a breadwinner dies or loses the ability to bring in income, if you don\u2019t have other sufficient assets to cover them.\nHe also recommends having so-called umbrella coverage \u2014 aka excess liability coverage \u2014 which is relatively inexpensive. It can provide an added layer of protection on top of your car and home insurance policies in case you get sued.\nMarket declines, volatility and occasional bear markets are to be expected when you invest for the long term. And a down market can provide you with some good buying opportunities because asset prices are cheaper, Grossman noted.\nBut no one likes to see their portfolio in the red over a period of time, because it feels like it will never end. Investors tend to suffer from \u201crecency bias,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cWe extrapolate from recent trends.\u201d That is, when stocks are rising year after year, it\u2019s hard to imagine them ever falling and vice versa.\nHe said he gets calls from clients every day worried about the effects that Trump\u2019s tariff wars will have on the economy. His advice: Resist any temptation to sell all your stocks or anything else equally drastic. \u201cUnless you absolutely need cash to pay the rent, don\u2019t take action based on the news headlines. Don\u2019t try to guess what the markets will do.\u201d\nInstead, Grossman suggested, ask yourself two questions: \u201cWhat do I need? And what danger am I facing?\u201d\nTo help answer them, start by reviewing your investment portfolio to see how it is split between stocks and bonds. If you have a 60-40 split, you may discover your portfolio hasn\u2019t taken nearly as big a hit as reports of stocks declining might suggest.\nNobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman says he thinks businesses will sit on their hands instead of investing when faced with too much uncertainty.\nRelated live storyThe Fed holds interest rates steady but cuts economic growth forecasts because of tariffs\nCheck, too, whether your stocks are diversified across sectors, investment styles andgeography. Being too heavily reliant on any one area \u2014 eg, tech stocks or growth stocks or domestic stocks \u2014 means you will be disproportionately hit if they\u2019re down. \u201cAsset allocation is your best and maybe only defense,\u201d Grossman said.\nSecond, consider that, historically, stocks have eventually recovered from big drops and gone on to deliver strong gains over the years for those who stay invested.\nThat said,recovery periods from serious drops can vary in lengthfrom a few months to a few years to a decade or more.\nA big decline in stocks when you\u2019re just starting your career is not a huge concern because you have decades of investment ahead. If you\u2019re close to or in retirement, it\u2019s more concerning. But you can mitigate that by keeping enough in bonds and cash to cover up to a few years\u2019 worth of your anticipated living expenses. That way you don\u2019t have to sell stocks to pay for your expenses if they\u2019re down.\nIf you become highly concerned about external events while still in the middle of your career, remember that you won\u2019t need money from your portfolio for many years.

They both discussed their preferred policies to help people\u2019s financial prospects.\nDespite Trump\u2019sconstant personal insults aimed at Powell\u2013 and their polar opposite approach to public discourse \u2013 the president and the Fed chair largely articulated the same problems and the solutions.\nPowell just made the case a little more clearly. Well, OK, a lot more clearly.\nThe fact that they agree, at least on a small handful of core economic principles and policies, represents an extraordinary development: 1) because Trump routinely drags Powell through the mud and plans onreplacing him next year. And 2) because Trump has struggled to win overdeeply skeptical Americanson the economy, and he might have just found the perfect spokesperson in his least-favorite appointee.\nTrump is losing the argument that he\u2019s Mr. Economy after winning the election primarily on an affordability agenda. Consumer sentiment surveys and political polls consistently show that Americans are fed up with Trump\u2019s handling of the economy because thecost of living is too high.\nThat has grown into a budding political crisis for Trump and Republicans, and the president acknowledged in a speech in northeast Pennsylvania Tuesday that his advisers persuaded him to go on the road to start communicating the benefits of his economic agenda to sway voters ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nTrumpundermined the argument of his prepared remarksby riffing on the economy with a series of unconvincing, hyperbolic assertions and false statements.\nBut his core argument Tuesday (and throughout his term) can be chalked up to this:\nTrump, of course, has an unorthodox and often self-defeating approach to economic policy that muddles his argument.\nFor example, he has repeatedly and falsely stated that there is \u201cno\u201d inflation and affordability is a \u201choax.\u201d He has significantly overstated the amount of revenue tariffs have brought in and incorrectly argued that they have not caused prices to rise. Trump has exaggerated the 2022 inflation crisis as the worst in US history. And his pressure campaign on Powell to lower interest rates has undermined the crucial independence of the Federal Reserve.\nBut you know who largely agrees with Trump\u2019s core argument? Jerome Powell.\nPowell on Wednesday said the US economy faces two concurrent problems, posing a unique challenge for the Fed: The job market is getting worse, while inflation on the rise. That\u2019s a concern because the Fed\u2019s rate setting tool can typically either help stimulate the job market or bring prices in control \u2013 but not both.\nSo the Fed needed to choose \u2013 and at its policy meeting concluding Wednesday, it chose to try to boost jobs by lowering rates at the risk of exacerbating inflation.\nThe reasons Powell laid out in a briefing with the press are nearly identical to Trump\u2019s argument.\n\u201cWe are going to need to have some years where real compensation is higher \u2026 for people to start feeling good about the affordability issue,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe are trying to keep inflation under control, but also support the labor market and strong wages, so that people are earning enough money and feeling economically healthy again.\u201d\nIt\u2019s Trump\u2019s basic argument, only spelled out in clearer and more coherent terms \u2013 and devoid of hyperbole and untruths.\nSo if Trump is looking for a spokesman to help make his case on the economy, he may want to turn to Powell. The Fed chief\u2019s going to be looking for his next gig pretty soon.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/11\/business\/jerome-powell-donald-trump-affordabliity","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The Fed leaves its key interest rate as is. Here\u2019s how you can benefit","date":"2025-05-07","body":"The Trump administration\u2019s tariffs regime hasdisrupted markets, darkened the outlook foremployersandbusinessesandhammered consumer sentiment.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s more important than ever to take control of what you can financially. That can start with making sure your savings are earning the best returns possible and are parked in the right types of accounts, given your needs and time horizon.\nRelated articleThe Fed holds interest rates steady again as the US economy slows on Trump\u2019s tariffs\nSince the Federal Reserve on Wednesdaydecided not to lowerits key overnight lending rate, which affects interest rates throughout the economy, you can still earn a very healthy yield on your cash.\nThat\u2019s good news since economists believe inflation \u2014 which came in at2.3% in March\u2013 will be going up this year as a result of the tariffs. By how much? Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace he expects both headline and core inflation to top 4% later this year.\nSo you\u2019ll want to look for returns on your cash that can match or beat that expectation.\nFor money you\u2019re setting aside for emergencies or for near-term but not immediate cash-flow needs, consider using:\nFDIC-insured online high-yield savings accounts:Having a checking and savings account at one of the big brick-and-mortar banks is great for money needed to pay monthly bills, groceries and other everyday expenses.\nBut for other money you want at the ready for less regular expenses, you\u2019ll get a much better rate in a high-yield savings account atan online FDIC-insured bank.\nAll bank savings rates are variable \u2014 so will fall if the Fed lowers its benchmark rate later this year. But, for now, many of the highest-yielding online savings accounts are paying between 4% and 4.4%, versus roughly 0.1% at the biggest banks like Chase, according to Bankrate.com.\nFDIC-insuredonline money market accounts:Another online banking option that pays very competitively are money market accounts.\n\u201cThe average MMA yield at brick-and-mortar banks is a scant 0.41%, whereas the top-yielding, nationally available MMAs offered by online banks pay 10 times that amount, 4.1% or more. Ten times the return, while still being fully covered by federal deposit insurance and (offering you) access to the money when it is needed,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate\u2019s chief financial analyst.\nFor money you\u2019ve set aside for down-the-line expenses like a down payment or a year or more of living expenses if you\u2019re retiring soon, you can lock in advantageous rates now through:\nTreasuries:Treasury billscome in six different maturities, ranging from four to 52 weeks.Treasury notesmature in two, three, five, seven and 10 years.\nIf you buy one and hold it to maturity, you will lock in a rate of return that is higher than inflation while also preserving your principal. If you want to know how much you\u2019ll make by holding it to maturity, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to beat,\u201d said Ken Robinson, an Ohio-based certified financial planner who is part of Wealthramp, a network of experienced, fee-only advisers.\nAs of Tuesday evening on Schwab.com, Treasury bills were offering average yields ranging from a low of 3.88% to a high of 4.33%, while Treasury note yields ranged from 3.78% to 4.28%.\nInterest paid on Treasuries is exempt from state and local income taxes, so may be a good option if you live in a high-tax area. Know, though, that if you sell a Treasury before it matures, that can trigger a capital gain or loss on the price you get for it.\nRelated articleMunicipal bond yields offer attractive returns for individual investors. Could Congress kill their tax advantage?\nAAA-rated municipal bonds:The tax advantages of high-quality municipal bonds are particularly favorable for those in high-tax states, and especially people in the top income tax brackets. The interest you earn on munis, which are issued by state and local governments, is exempt from federal income tax. It also may be exempt from state and local taxes if you buy one issued by your home state.\n\u201c(Highly rated muni bonds) have a supremely strong record of paying what they\u2019re supposed to when they\u2019re supposed to,\u201d Robinson said.\nAs with Treasuries, he noted, the key to getting the most out of a municipal bond is to hold it to maturity.\nCertificates of deposit:CDs from FDIC-insured banks are a reliable place to park money that you can afford to lock up for a fixed period.\nFor instance, CDs with maturation periods ranging from 3 months to five years were all offering average yields over 4% on Schwab.com. A good number of individual one-year CDs were offering a return between 4.5% and 5%.\nKeep in mind, earnings on a CD are subject to federal, state and local income taxes. In addition, if you buy a CD direct from a bank, you may pay an early withdrawal penalty if you cash it out before maturity, although such apenalty will be tax deductible. If you buy a so-called \u201cbrokered\u201d CD on a brokerage platform \u2014 which offers you a much wider range of CDs to choose from \u2014 you might lose money on your principal if you don\u2019t hold it to maturity and instead sell it into the secondary market at less than you bought it for, Robinson noted.\nMoney market mutual funds:Money market mutual funds are currently averaging 4.14%, according to Crane Data, with some funds paying close to 4.4%.\nUnlike with fixed-rate bonds, Treasuries or CDs, you can\u2019t lock in a rate of return with a money market fund. But it\u2019s an easy, one-stop shop to park money that will always get the best cash yields on offer.\nMoney market funds, which invest in government and corporate debt securities, are considered low-risk investments that usually maintain a price of $1 a share, although there have been a few times when they \u201cbroke the buck\u201d and traded below $1 a share.\nIf the fund invests in top-rated municipal securities issued by your home state, your returns may be tax-free.\nUnlike money market accounts, money market mutual funds are not federally insured.\nThere is nothing encouraging to say about interest rates on debt other than at least the Fed didn\u2019t choose to raise rates, which would make your prospects for finding an affordable loan worse. That said, how you manage your debt is ultimately way more important than any move the Fed makes.\nCredit cards:Even if the Fed were to make dramatic rate cuts, the interest you pay to borrow money on a credit card likely will remain sky-high. In fact, the average credit card rate actually rose to 20.12% as of April 30 from 20.09% the week before, according to Bankrate.com.\nThe best thing you can do if you carry high-rate credit card debt is to see if you can get a 0% balance transfer card, said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. That will buy you up to 21 months interest free, during which time you can direct as much money as you can to paying down your balance.\nMortgages:As of May 1, interest rates on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.76%, according to Freddie Mac. That\u2019s 0.05 points lower than the prior week, and just under half a point below the 7.22% average recorded around May 1 last year.\n\u201cFor those shopping for a home this summer, rates are likely to stay in or around (the 6.6% to 7%) range in the near future. Even a rate cut from the Fed may not send mortgage rates lower, as the Fed doesn\u2019t impact mortgage rates directly the way they do with credit cards,\u201d Schulz said.\nCar loans:Financing a car purchase is always a little complex. But the math is harder now.\n\u201cToday\u2019s car shoppers are contending with the difficult duo of elevated vehicle costs and high borrowing rates,\u201d said Joseph Yoon, a consumer insights analyst at Edmunds.com. \u201cAdding to this scenario is the ambiguity surrounding tariff repercussions on vehicle supply and, consequently, their price tags, forcing buyers to navigate an ever-more complicated shopping path.\u201d\nIn April the average amount financed for a new car rose  about $400 to $41,444 at 7.1% interest over 69 months, with an average monthly payment of $744, according to data from Edmunds.com. For used cars, the average loan amount was up about $600 to $28,855 at 10.9% over 69.5 months, with an average monthly payment of $555.\nYoon\u2019s advice: Be really clear what your needs are for a new car versus your wants \u2014 including things like size and desired features.\nThen shop around for the best deals and carefully compare loan offers. To help with the math, Edmunds.com has acar loan interest calculator.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/07\/business\/your-savings-fed-rate-decision","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s chaotic loan freeze ordeal is bad for business","date":"2025-01-29","body":"The US government has many ways to funnel financial support to businesses, both large and small, helping them to do research and development, expand operations, hire and pay staff, and compete in the global market place. Just about all of those means of financial support were up in the air as of Tuesday evening.\nThe Trump administration attempted to place an indefinite freeze on federal grants and loan programs Monday night, a move that left many questions for businesses that have come to depend on government support for their plans and activities.\nThen late Tuesday a federal judge blocked the move from taking place for \u201copen awards\u201d already granted through at least Monday, creating even more uncertainty.\nAnd if there\u2019s one thing that businesses hate, it is uncertainty. But it\u2019s the best they have for a least a little while.\nThe move by the Trump administration sowed chaos and mass confusion across non-profits, local governments, universities, and recipients of other federal money. But businesses spread across every state depend on government grants and loan programs too, using literally tens of billions of federal dollars to employ perhaps millions of workers.\nWhether that spigot is in danger of being turned off by the Trump administration\u2019sfreeze on federal grants and loan programs, and if so, for how long, was difficult to sort out Tuesday, even before the judge\u2019s ruling. But there is clearly lots at stake.\nThe federal Office of Management and Budget issued a two-page memo late Monday saying it was instituting a \u201cTemporary pause of agency grant, loan, and other financial assistance programs.\u201d The memo seemed to make clear it wants to continue and perhaps even increase help for businesses, as long as the Trump administration likes what they intend to do with the money.\n\u201cFinancial assistance should be dedicated to advancing administration priorities\u2026 unleashing American energy and manufacturing,\u201d the statement said.\nBut some assistance to businesses is clearly on the administration\u2019s crosshairs. The memo specifically said \u201cThe use of Federal resources to advance\u2026 green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve.\u201d\nThere is no such thing as a \u201cgreen new deal.\u201d The effort to pass that in 2019 during the first Trump administration failed. But clean energy projects got a major financial lift in 2022 when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which despite the name, focused greatly on support for energy and the environment. It included loans to help companies build electric vehicle plants and battery factories that are expected to create thousands of jobs, often in \u201cred\u201d states that President Donald Trump has won. The status of those previously announced loans is not clear, even before the court decision Tuesday evening.\nThe DOE reports that as of the end of the latest fiscal year in September it had funded $46.9 billion worth of \u201cinnovative clean energy projects and advanced technology vehicle manufacturing facilities across the United States.\u201d\nFor example, BlueOval SK, a joint venture between Ford and Korean battery maker SK, received a $9.6 billion loan that is being to be used to build three EV battery plants \u2013 two in Kentucky one in Tennessee. Each plant is expected to employ 2,500 workers. One of the Kentucky plants and the Tennessee plants are due to start production later this year.\nBut a spokesperson for BlueOval SK did not answer questions about whether the \u201cpause\u201d announced Monday puts this or any other federal financial support at risk.\nStarPlus Energy,a joint venture between Samsung SDI and automaker Stellantis, which builds cars under the Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands, also has a $7.5 billion loan that closed in December to build two lithium-ion battery cell and module manufacturing plants in Kokomo, Indiana. It also said it couldn\u2019t answer questions from CNN on the status of its loan.\nBut federal financial support is crucial for American automakers trying to compete with Chinese car companies, who have received massive support from their own government to ramp up the country\u2019s domestic electric vehicle industry, a letter to Congress from a trade group that represents automakers receiving loans said last year.\n\u201cNations around the world are moving aggressively to lead the development and deployment of these emerging automotive technologies,\u201d said theletterfrom the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the industry trade group, which told CNN that it maintains the letter\u2019s position. \u201cThe US must do everything it can to protect its competitiveness in a global marketplace, ensure a level playing field against unfair trade, technology, and subsidy practices.\u201d\nThe group pointed out that the Chinese auto industry now produces about 10 million EVs and plug-in hybrids year, roughly equivalent to all the passenger cars made at American car factories.\nIt\u2019s not just the Department of Energy that has supported American clean energy efforts. The Small Business Administration, the Commerce Department\u2019s Economic Development Agency and the Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that funds or backs loans used by American exporters to fund purchases by their foreign clients, all talk about clean energy loans in their year-end reports for last year.\nNone of those agencies responded to requests for comments from CNN Tuesday ahead of the court decision about how those or other financial support for the businesses they serve could be affected by the freeze on grants and loans.\nThe SBA provided $56 billion to small businesses and disaster-impacted communities in fiscal year 2024 which ended in September, making more than 100,000 business loans in that time. In addition to an increased emphasis on clean energy loans last year, it also highlighted loan programs targeting women-owned and minority-owned businesses. It\u2019s not clear whether those programs are also at risk since the OMB statement also identified DEI programs, or diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, as something it wants to root out during this current freeze.\nMuch federal funding goes to industries with much broader political support. For example, the 2022 bi-partisan CHIPS Act approved $39 billion for manufacturing incentives to support building or expanding 16 US semiconductor factories, plus an additional $11B for research and development assistance.\nThe programs that provide loans or grants to American businesses send most of that help to a wide variety of businesses in a range of industries representing core components from the American economy \u2013 from construction, hospitality and tourism, agriculture, traditional energy companies, health care and manufacturers large and small.\nAsked at Tuesday\u2019s White House press conference how organizations that rely on federal funding should make payroll, Trump Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Russ Vought, the acting head of the OMB, had said that if a government agency makes a case for a grant or a loan being \u201cnecessary,\u201d he would review the policy in that case to see if \u201cit is in-line with the President\u2019s agenda.\u201d\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill were quick to object to the cut-off, saying that the money for those programs were appropriated by Congress and that the administration does not have the unilateral power to cut it off, no matter how he feels about programs.\nThe Trump administration has positioned itself as pro-business so it\u2019s not clear how long it will choke off all the grant and loan programs flowing to corporate America long-term. Programs that are supposed to help develop clean energy, or which give preferences to minority groups, are likely most at risk. But even some of them could end up being restored, especially if the money is being used to build factories and creating jobs in red states.\nBut as of Tuesday, there is far more uncertainty than answers about what lays ahead for businesses that have made strategic decisions based upon the expectation of continued help.\nCNN\u2019s Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/29\/business\/trumps-federal-grant-loan-halt-business","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

At one point, he went as far as to undercut one of Trump\u2019s key barometers of economic success \u2014 a decline in the price of eggs since January \u2014 by admitting that the food staple is still too expensive for many people.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an American who\u2019s just struggling to get by, you work hard, you pay your taxes, you want your kids to have good opportunities. And then the price of eggs goes from $2 a dozen to $8 a dozen under the Biden administration, and then it goes from $8 a dozen to maybe $6.50 a dozen,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWell, to you that is still a major problem.\u201d\nThe vice president sought to cast much of the blame for voters\u2019 sour mood on former President Joe Biden, complaining that the prior administration had \u201cput us in a very tough spot.\u201d He also blamed Democrats for any near-term economic fallout from the record-longgovernment shutdown.\n\u201cI do think that actually pumped the brakes a little bit on all the economic news that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Vance said of the shutdown. \u201cThat\u2019s going to cause a little bit of damage.\u201d\nThe vice president also celebrated astronger-than-expected September jobs reportreleased earlier on Thursday, calling it evidence that Trump\u2019s policies were working.\nYet he allowed that the Trump administration still has plenty of work to do to convince voters that those policies stand to benefit them, departing from the president\u2019s preferred approach of touting his agenda as an unqualified success.\nAt a US-Saudi Investment Forum a day earlier, Trump dismissed the focus on affordability, calling it a \u201cnew word\u201d that Democrats have latched on to since he took office.\n\u201cThe only thing that we\u2019re going up in is our stock market, okay, we\u2019re bringing prices down,\u201d Trump said, despite the rise in the cost of key products likebeef and coffeethat economists have blamed at least in part on the administration\u2019s tariffs. \u201cBut they came up with a new word that they\u2019re using: affordability.\u201d\nThe president in speeches and social media posts since Democrats\u2019 electoral victories earlier this month has also called affordability concerns a \u201ccon job,\u201d urging voters to credit him for falling gasoline prices and an inflation rate that\u2019s come down from its Biden-era peak \u2014 but begun over the last several months to slowly climb once again.\nThe White House has floated a range of initiatives aimed at reining in the cost of living despite Trump\u2019s insistence that prices are falling, including rolling back tariffs on hundreds of products and raising the prospect of sending $2,000 checks to Americans at some point next year. Trump isalso expected to step up domestic travelin the coming months focused on promoting his economic agenda, as aides try to boost voter awareness of the administration\u2019s accomplishments.\nTrump aides are also planning topitch a new health reform planahead of the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies amid GOP fears that the party will pay a hefty political price if voters\u2019 health insurance costs skyrocket.\nBut the administration has offered few details about what that plan will look like. Though Vance on Thursday claimed the eventual proposal would get bipartisan support, he did not provide specifics.\nThe vice president also offered few new strategies for ushering in the booming economy that he said \u201cwe really do believe is coming,\u201d arguing only that the administration needed a bit more time to realize its goals.\n\u201cThe thing I\u2019d ask from the American people is to ask for a little bit of patience,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe just gotta keep it going.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/20\/politics\/jd-vance-economy-patience-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The Biden administration hadproposed modest increasesto the requirements for the vehicles most Americans drive as part of a push to promote electric vehicles and battle climate change.\nTrump condemned the Biden policy as \u201canti-economy\u201d on Wednesday, with Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy echoing similar criticisms.\n\u201cWhat Democrats were doing were not making cars more affordable. They were making them less affordable,\u201d Duffy said in the Oval Office. \u201cThe consequence of that is going to be that more Americans can afford to buy a new car.\u201d\nThe new standards, he said, will increase road safety and help automakers create new jobs.\n\u201cThe more cars we sell, the more jobs we have in this country,\u201d Duffy said.\nIn a statement ahead of the gathering, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised the administration\u2019s move and emphasized the company\u2019s support for revising federal requirements.\n\u201cAs America\u2019s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump\u2019s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities.

{"title":"Trump\u2019s drive-thru affordability speech won\u2019t fix his political woes over the economy","date":"2025-11-18","body":"President Donald Trump proclaimed an economic golden age under the Golden Arches. But while he may have a regular guy\u2019s taste in fast food, he\u2019s looking oblivious to the wrenching price pressure haunting millions of Americans.\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a time like this,\u201d he declared Monday at a summit of McDonald\u2019s franchise owners in Washington. The president waxed lyrical about his favorite Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and fondly recalled his turnworking the fry stationat one of the fast-food giant\u2019s Pennsylvania restaurants last year.\nBut Trump\u2019s overall message was jarring, as he argued the economy was super-sized even while millions struggle to afford the cost of living. \u201cYou know, I just might add, this is also the golden age of America, because we are doing better than we\u2019ve ever done as a country. Prices are coming down and all of that stuff,\u201d Trump said.\nHe went on, \u201cWe are looking at affordability \u2014 we are going to bring it down for everybody because not everybody understands the fact that a great stock market is great for everybody,\u201d including 401Ks.\nCitizens lucky enough to have pension funds linked to record stock markets have done well recently. But they\u2019ve also been punishedby daily costsand the money in their paychecksnot going as far. And that leaves the common touch Trump effectively highlighted as a candidatenow in question. Political peril lurks for him in the gap between a complex reality and his happy talk about the economy \u2014 punctuated in his speech Monday by digressions over his renaming of the Gulf of Mexico and his obsession with slow-running taps.\nTrump came over all poetic about the unique place of McDonald\u2019s in American communities. \u201cBefore the sun rises, you\u2019re up serving hot coffee to construction workers, nurses and police officers on the way to the job,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the evening, you stand ready with the fast dinner and the smile for busy moms and their children. There\u2019s a race from school to soccer practice, really, it\u2019s Americana.\u201d\nThis was high praise coming from a master of branding. But as he often does, Trump explained his political rationale out loud. If he couldn\u2019t truthfully claim to have delivered lower prices, he can try to steal his opponents\u2019 branding on the issue.\n\u201cThe word is affordable,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd affordable should be our word, not theirs, because the Democrats got up and said \u2018affordability, affordability\u2019 and they don\u2019t say that they had the worst inflation in history, the highest energy prices in history, everything was the worst. What they are great at is lying.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s speech came across as an attempt to show understanding about daily costs and to repair Republican vulnerabilities exposed by a big night for Democrats ingubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jerseythis month. But it would be hard to conclude his rambling cheerleading fulfilled either goal.\nFirst, and most dauntingly, for Trump, the high prices for mostfood,housingandhealth carethat are antagonizing Americans and souring their confidence in his leadership are almost certainly not coming down.\nWhile inflation, the rate at which prices are rising, is at 3.0% \u2014 far lower than the 9.1% peak during the Biden Administration \u2014 costs are still going up. No economist wants to see prices go down in a cycle of deflation \u2014 that would be a harbinger of a big recession with massive job losses. But at the same time, and after decades of low inflation, voters have yet to adjust to the post-pandemic price shock.\nMaybe voters were insulated from economic pressures for decades and have unrealistic expectations. But that doesn\u2019t make it feel any easier.\nAnd after driving Democrats out of the White House partly over their poor record on inflation and affordability \u2014 and 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris\u2019s lack of answers on those issues \u2014 Trump is now suffering the incumbent\u2019s curse. He\u2019s been office for nearly 10 months and voters aren\u2019t feeling better, so he\u2019s getting the blame. Affordability can get a politician elected. But it then becomes their problem.\nThe statute of limitations for blaming the Biden administration is running out. \u201c(Democrats) are saying that the runaway spending that we gave you guys, that created runaway inflation, is 100% your fault,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said on CNBC Monday. But those are the breaks, even for a president who\u2019d prefer the buck didn\u2019t stop with him.\nTrump has made significant policy steps to try to alleviate the burden on working Americans. He\u2019s trying to bring down the cost ofprescription drugs. He temporarily eliminatedtax on most tipsin his big domestic policy legislation. In his speech to McDonald\u2019s franchise owners, he argued that his slashing of regulations that constrain small business growth would end up helping everyone.\nBut insecurity felt by many Americans who are one layoff away from losing health insurance is structural and long-term; it can\u2019t be fixed with a few quick policy initiatives.\nIt\u2019s going to need more than Trump\u2019s first big political point in his Monday speech: \u201cYou are so damn lucky that I won that election.\u201d\nThere\u2019s growing evidence his policies may be making things worse. Global trade wars andhigh tariffsare contributing to rising costs, according to multiple independent analyses. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, for instance, reported that the tariffs amounted to an effective tax hike on the average American household of $1,200, a figure set to rise to $1,600 next year.ACNN poll this monthfound 61% of Americans said Trump\u2019s policies have \u201cworsened economic conditions in this country.\u201d And everyone who does their own shopping feels the pain every time they go to the grocery store.\nAlleviating the situation will be tricky. Trump\u2019s newest proposals look buzzy and may help at the margins. A potential plan to send out$2000 tariff revenue paymentsis one idea \u2014 though such a rush of cash into the economy could spike inflation. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer predicted Monday that such checks wouldn\u2019t fix the damage and added \u201cwho knows if they\u2019ll ever come.\u201d\nOfficials are thinking aloud about50-year mortgages. This might get people into homes \u2014 if there\u2019s sufficient supply. But they may never be able to pay them off.\nMore fundamentally, the White House seems to be implicitly admitting that the tariffs are partly to blame, while insisting publicly that they are not. Trump issued an executive order on Fridaycutting dutieson beef, tomatoes, coffee and bananas. \u201cThe prices for those goods weren\u2019t necessarily going up just because of tariffs,\u201d Hassett said on ABC News \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, said on ABC News \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. But he added, \u201cThe prices will go down,\u201d arguing that this was not due to removing tariffs but rather an increased supply of goods.\nBut Trump isn\u2019t slashing tariffs across the board. To do so would repudiate the central principle of his entire economic policy \u2014 which is designed to trigger a revival of American manufacturing. The downside of this strategy was always that if even if it works, it will take years to fully play out, after a period of economic adjustment and pain in the meantime. That\u2019s time Trump doesn\u2019t have, with midterm elections less than a year away.\nAnd the president has left himself politically exposed after attempting such a risky strategy to remake the global trading system that almost every economist predicted would raise prices. It was probably just a coincidence, but he blamed his raspy voice Monday on having to shout at somebody over trade policy with an unidentified country. \u201cI blew my stack at these people,\u201dhe told a reporter.\nAnother complication for Trump is that his impressive power at defining the political narrative may be starting to fail him. He was just forced into acomplete reversalby calling on the House of Representatives to vote to compel his own Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files to avoid an embarrassing political defeat.\nEven one of his top supporters,Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, is rebuking him for losing sight of the concerns of the MAGA base, including on costs. Convincing millions of voters that an election was stolen is one thing. Telling them the economy is in a \u201cgolden age\u201d when they know well that it is not won\u2019t work. Trump seems to be coming dangerously close to the inflation denial of the Biden administration, which helped cost Democrats the 2024 election.\nTrump has hardly been helping himself. Obsessing over personal legacy projects like the newWhite House ballroom, dining with corporate CEOs and flying around the world in search of a Nobel Peace Prize isn\u2019t exactly the look of a president laser-focused on the uncertainty facing millions of Americans.\nAnd his speech at the McDonald\u2019s event did not offer any real sense of empathy for people who were hurting. He threw in the new Washington buzzword \u201caffordability\u201d a few times. He offered a litany of statistics that were often misleading about prices coming down. Such claims are often incomplete or untrue, asCNN\u2019s Daniel Dale has documented.\nBut Trump did show flashes of what makes him a compelling political personality. He quipped that some people might not want to hand down wealth to children they didn\u2019t like. If only that were a concern for most Americans. And he revealed striking new operational details about the daring US stealth bomber raid that targeted Iran\u2019s nuclear sites earlier this year.\nBut his levity felt off-key given the subject, and politically unwise amid claims he\u2019s out of touch. Trump aides are thinking aboutsending him around the countryto give a series of economic speeches. But the president himself identified a potential flaw with that strategy, celebrating his refusal to stick to a script during his appearance on Monday.\nTrump said he\u2019d given a McDonald\u2019s executive a signed page of his printed speech offstage. \u201c\u2018I said, do you want to keep this? You can either hang it, you can give it to somebody, you can throw it away. I don\u2019t care.\u2019 But I don\u2019t stay on the speech too long anyway, you know, so usually those speeches aren\u2019t too accurate.\u201d\nAnd one more thing. The next time the Beast presidential limo shows up at a drive-thru, the commander-in-chief has a special request. \u201cI like the fish. I like it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou could do a little bit more tartar sauce someplace, seriously.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/18\/politics\/trump-mcdonalds-economy-tariffs-rebate-checks-inflation-analysis","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The Fed just cut rates. Here\u2019s how to make that move work for your money","date":"2025-09-17","body":"The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee on Wednesday decided to cut the central bank\u2019s key overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point, itsfirst cut in nine months.\nGiven the Fed\u2019s dual mandate of keeping inflation in check while maximizing employment, it chose a quarter-point cut in the face of asoftening labor market but also \u201csomewhat elevated\u201d inflation, which is still above the Fed\u2019s 2% target rate and rising. In addition, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the effects on inflation of the federal government\u2019s tariffs remain uncertain.\nWednesday\u2019s move and any future Fed cuts this year \u2014 investors still expect one or two more from the Fed\u2019s October and December meetings \u2014 will directly affect your money.\nThe Fed delivers the first interest rate cut of Trump\u2019s second term after nine-month pause\nLong story short for your savings: It won\u2019t be as readily easy to snag top interest rates on a variety of bank-related accounts, since those will now fall in line with the Fed\u2019s cut. But if you\u2019re willing to do a little yield hunting you could still come out ahead. The same goes for your bond investments.\nThe story for your debts is less rosy at the moment: If you already have high-rate debt it will remain so, albeit a little less high. If you\u2019re in the market for a loan, you will want to shop around carefully and check the fine print on the terms.\nThere are still opportunities to find inflation-beating, solid returns on your savings if you look.\nYour best bet in most instances will be to select from FDIC-insured online banks, since they typically offer the best returns for high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit, said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com, which is now owned by Lending Tree, and the founder of a new site, DepositQuest.com.\nBut tax and inflation considerations might make different types of fixed income assets such as Treasuries, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, more attractive.\nHigh-yield bank savings accounts:These accounts have variable rates, so they will fall in the wake of the Fed\u2019s cut. But they tend to fall more slowly at online banks, Tumin said.\nThe overall average rate on a high-yield savings accounts was just 0.61% as of Wednesday, according to Bankrate. But the best deals can be found at online banks, many of which are offering rates ranging from 3.5% to 4.35%.\nThese accounts offer you easy accessibility to your money, so can be a good place to park your emergency savings and any other money you don\u2019t need for a year or two.\nNo-penalty CDs:But there may be an even better option now than high-yield accounts for that kind of money. Specifically, different types of CDs.\nFirst, look for a no-penalty CD \u2014 which lets you lock down a higher fixed rate for a given period of time and generally will not penalize you if you take out money before the CD matures. The only requirement is that you leave your money invested for 7 days, and some products may limit the number of withdrawals you may make thereafter. But it beats the penalties you will be charged in most CDs, which will reduce the amount of interest you\u2019re paid if you take your money prematurely.\nTwo of the best no-penalty CDs Tumin found this week are: A seven-month, 4% no-penalty CD from Marcus by Goldman Sachs Bank with a $500 minimum deposit requirement; and a 13-month, 4.05% CD from M.Y. Safra Bank, which has a $5,000 minimum deposit requirement.\nWith any CD you\u2019re looking into, check whether it is \u201ccallable.\u201d If it is, that means the bank can change its mind as rates are falling and recall its CD. If it does, it will pay you back your principal plus whatever interest is owed to you to date. Ideally it\u2019s best to get a non-callable CD if the yield is attractive.\n\u201cAdd-on\u201d CDs:Another CD variety is the \u201cadd-on\u201d CD, which lets you lock in a rate when you invest your money. But you can add more money to it during that term and still get the same rate on your new deposits.\nWhile many may charge a penalty if you take your money out before the CD matures, \u201c(it) gives you a hedge against falling rates,\u201d Tumin said, noting that you\u2019re likely to get the best terms from online banks. One of the best he has seen offers a 3.95% rate over a 24-month term.\nBrokered CDs:If you have some savings that you can hold to a CD\u2019s maturity \u2013 so penalties aren\u2019t a concern \u2013 look for the best yields on regular CDs. Brokerages offer you the best rates to choose from nationally. And if you\u2019re pressed for the money before the CD matures you can sell it on the secondary market (though you may incur a capital gain if you sell it for more than you bought it for).\nAs of Wednesday, the average interest rate on brokered CDs with durations of between three months and five years were largely between 3.75% and 4% on Schwab.com.\nMoney market funds:Another option for your savings to get the latest and best interest rates, albeit variable, are money market funds, which are not FDIC-insured but are considered very low risk.\nThe average 7-day yield on money market funds as of Wednesday was 4.09%, according to Crane Data.\nThe largest such fund, the Vanguard Federal Money Market Index, which is also among the lowest cost, had a 7-day yield of 4.19% as of Tuesday.\nTreasury bills:The average yield on Treasury bills ranged from 3.61% for the 18-month T-bill to 3.96% for the three-month, according to Schwab.com data Wednesday.\nAnother option if you don\u2019t want to invest in individual T-bills might be to find a low-cost Treasury bill ETF, Tumin suggested.\nMake your money work for you by \u2018laddering\u2019 bonds or CDs\nTax wise, if you live in a high-tax state or city, Treasuries may be more advantageous than savings accounts and CDs. That\u2019s because the interest you\u2019re paid is typically exempt from state and local taxes. If you live in a state with no income tax, however, a CD might be more advantageous if it offers a higher yield.\nTIPS:Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities are a particularly attractive option for retirees concerned about inflation eroding the value of their savings that produces their income over time. TIPS offer a base \u201creal\u201d rate of return on top of the level ofinflationduring the term of the instrument.\n\u201cIf you hold it to maturity you know you won\u2019t lose anything, and you will get a premium (yield) over inflation,\u201d Tumin said. Some retirees, he noted, create TIPSladdersto insure they get inflation-indexed income every year.\nHere\u2019s the outlook for credit cards, mortgages and auto loans.\nCredit cards:The average credit card rate \u2014 which at latest reading is 20.12% \u2014 has been north of 20% since March 2023, according to Bankrate.\nAfter the Fed\u2019s quarter-point cut Wednesday the average may fall, but it could still be a whopping 19.87%. And it may take a couple of payment cycles before your card issuer lowers your rate.\nHow much will that reduction save you? Bankrate estimates that people making just the monthly minimum payment of $173 on the average credit card balance of $6,473 might save all of one dollar a month in payments when their rate is reduced.\nIf you\u2019re paying, say, $400 a month on that balance,the quarter-point rate reduction will reduce the time it takes you to pay off your debt from 20 months to 19 months; and it will only shave $17 off your total interest payments.\nWhatwillsave you real money is to stop waiting on the Fed to lower rates. If you can\u2019t clear your balance with one or two payments, see if you qualify for a zero-rate balance transfer card, which will buy you up to 24 months to pay off your remaining balance interest free.\nIf you don\u2019t qualify for one, call your card issuer and try to negotiate a lower rate.\nOr, if you\u2019re really in deep with five-figure credit card debt, Bankrate senior industry analyst Ted Rossman suggests looking into a debt management plan with reputable companies like Greenpath or Money Management International. \u201cYou can probably consolidate your 20, 25 or 30% rates into a DMP with a 6% rate lasting four or five years,\u201d Rossman noted in a recent analysis.\nMortgages:Unlike most bank savings and loan products, mortgage rates don\u2019t move in direct response to the Fed\u2019s rate decisions. In fact, when the Fed started cutting rates last fall, mortgage rates rose. That\u2019s because they move in response to the 10-year Treasury yield, which reflects how traders feel about the future of the US economy and what they anticipate about the Fed\u2019s next moves.\nRight now, the market expects there will be three to four quarter-point cuts over the next six months, according to Carlton Davis, a fixed income trader and portfolio manager for Chevy Chase Trust.\nMortgage rates are finally sinking \u2014 and fast\n\u201cMortgage rates may stay relatively flat in the short term since markets had already priced in this (Fed) cut,\u201d said Bill Banfield, Rocket Mortgage\u2019s chief business officer.\nThe good news for home buyers is that mortgage rates have fallen recently. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell to 6.35% for the week ending September 11, down from 6.50% the week before, according to Freddie Mac data. But that is still higher than the 6.20% registered a year earlier.\nIn terms of home affordability, it\u2019s not just interest rates but prices that affect buyers\u2019 decisions. Like the 30-year average, home prices on average are more expensive than they were a year ago.\nSo, while a rate cut may improve market sentiment, the calculator will bethe biggest determinant in your willingness to seal the dealon such an important investment.\nIf you already own a home and plan to borrow against it, you will see a small downward shift in rates. Last week, the average variable rate on a home equity line of credit was 8.10%; and the average fixed rate on home equity loans was 8.23%, according to Bankrate.\nThose are still much higher than the average mortgage rate. But if you have great credit, a small loan-to-value ratio and shop around for the best deal, you likely can secure the lowest rates available, Bankrate found.\nAuto loans:In August the average amount borrowed to buy a new car was $42,701, with a monthly payment of $757 at an average rate of 7%, according to car data site Edmunds.com. For used cars, the average financed was $29,585, with an average monthly payment of $565 at a rate of 10.7%.\nThose rates are above historic norms, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds\u2019 head of insights.\nThe Fed\u2019s modest rate cut will only push auto loan rates down a little, so it \u201cwon\u2019t dramatically slash monthly payments for consumers. But it does boost overall buyer sentiment,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cEven if the dollar impact is limited, these cues gain power when paired with sales events like model-year closeouts, Black Friday deals, and year-end promotions.\u201d\nBut read the fine print when presented with lower APR promotions.\n\u201cThese offers are typically limited to shorter terms \u2014 often capped at 48 or 60 months \u2014 which doesn\u2019t necessarily ease affordability for buyers who depend on longer loan terms to keep monthly payments manageable,\u201d said Joseph Yoon, Edmunds\u2019 consumer insights analyst. \u201cSaving money long term can mean paying more month to month, so shoppers need to carefully weigh whether that trade-off fits within their budget.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/17\/business\/your-money-federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s first problem on the economy and health care: admitting he\u2019s got a problem","date":"2025-12-08","body":"President Donald Trump has a fresh chance this week to act on a priority voters continually say they want fixed \u2014 but over which he\u2019s in denial.\nThehigh and rising pricesof health care, groceries and housing are a leading impediment to the lives of millions of Americans. But Trump, not unusually for presidents, seems more interested in his own political goals and obsessions.\nAmericans wracked by economic insecurity can\u2019t wait. Nor can Republican lawmakers, who fear the president\u2019s response \u2014 which is largely to blame his predecessor Joe Biden \u2014 will doom their reelection chances next year.\n\u201cEvery bill we bring to the floor should be focused on lowering the cost of living for people who need it most,\u201d Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, one of the most at-risk Republicans in the 2026 midterms,told CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics Sunday.\u201d\nThe Senate is expected to vote as soon as this week on whether to extend expiring subsidies on Affordable Care Act programs as part of last month\u2019s deal to end the government shutdown. If Congress doesn\u2019t act, millionswill face a choicebetween much higher premiums or simply going without coverage.\nTrump meanwhile is expected to hold an event in Pennsylvania on making prices more affordable, as his administration faces increasing pressure to demonstrate it understands an issue that was instrumental in his election last year.\nThe prospects of decisive action this week on either score are low, however.\nA plan to address Republican qualms while extending enhanced subsidies without major reforms to Obamacaredoesn\u2019t yet exist. And even if the Senate finds a compromise, there\u2019s little appetite among Republicans in Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s narrow House majority to save a law they\u2019ve always hated.\nTrump fumes even at the word \u201caffordability\u201d \u2014 regarding it as a Democratic \u201choax\u201d \u2014 and is wallowing in denial about an economy that he claims has entered a \u201cgolden age\u201d but that is making many working- and middle-class Americans feel poorer. And while Trump has taken some steps totry to lower costs\u2014 of certain prescription drugs, for example \u2014 his wider policies may be making the situation worse.\nThe administration tacitly admitted as much when it recentlycut import dutieson coffee, bananas and other staples to ease the pain of consumers.\n\u201cAs a nation, we have much to be grateful for this holiday season,\u201d Trump said while lighting the National Christmas Tree last week, proclaiming big wins on the border, national security and ending wars. He also said, \u201cOur economy is thriving, inflation has stopped, our nation is strong, and America is back bigger and better, stronger, better than ever before.\u201d This may be one issue where the president\u2019s talent for branding can\u2019t get him out of a political hole.\nA CNN\/SSRS poll last month found 61% of Americans said Trump\u2019s policies have \u201cworsened economic conditions in this country.\u201d A recent CBS survey found only 36% approved of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, a onetime strength.\nThe contradiction between the president\u2019s claims of success and the lived experience of many Americans raises the question of whether Trump, a billionaire, and his wealthy Cabinet have lost touch with what the country is feeling.\nThe fight over health care is the most urgent and visible clash in the affordability crisis.\nIf the enhanced subsidies expire at the end of the year, enrollees will face payments that many can\u2019t afford \u2014 doubling from $888 to $1,904 next year on average,according to a new pollfrom KFF, a nonpartisan health policy group.\nThe stark politics of this issue for Republicans explain why Democrats picked the subsidies as the trigger for the government shutdown. They failed to achieve their goal, but highlighted the catch-22 of GOP lawmakers who want to kill Obamacare but whose success would hurt millions of their voters who rely on the program.\nSome Republicans are pushing to extend the subsidies, to give them time to draw up a more permanent replacement health care plan. Others want reform before agreeing to an extension. But then the question becomes how to help Americans who suddenly find themselves with premiums they can\u2019t afford.\nThe conundrum was encapsulated by Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday.\n\u201cJust to extend three years something that has not been working that was meant to be temporary from the beginning is not a good vote,\u201d Curtis told Dana Bash.\n\u201cWe need a minimum premium for people, even if it\u2019s a couple of bucks. We know we need a cap on income,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we actually lower the cost, not just of insurance, but of health care? And then what do we do in the interim while we\u2019re waiting to do that?\u201d\nAs Curtis implied, the chances of a workable reform to Obamacare in the few days Congress is in session before the holidays seem remote.\nMeanwhile, most people have already been forced to make their health care budget decisions for next year. This is why some Republicans say a vote to extend subsidies is the only answer. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a better plan, then get on board with ours,\u201d Fitzpatrick told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on \u201cInside Politics Sunday.\u201d\nTrump has hardly helped the situation. He has repeatedly failed to lay down a blueprint or to take the complexities of the health insurance market seriously during two presidential terms. He did vaguely suggest that Congress should set up health savings accounts but has put no political muscle behind it. The White House also recentlypulled back a planto extend subsidies amid GOP opposition. Democrats are meanwhile salivating at the prospect of highlighting health care costs in campaign ads they can aim at swing-seat voters next year.\nThe president is expected to head to Pennsylvania, a state he won in 2024, this week to show solidarity with voters fed up with high prices. But he seems unlikely to ease his political situation, or the economic well-being of working Americans by talking about it. He is resistant to accepting the issue\u2019s political potency. And in the past, he\u2019s struggled to stick to a script and mocked advisers who suggest he needs to show economic empathy.\n\u201cThey wanted to do a speech on the economy, so we are doing this as an intellectual speech. You are all intellectuals today,\u201d he told a crowd in North Carolina in 2024.\nTrump has always been more of a cheerleader than a feel-your-pain president. Yet his transformation of the Republican Party into a populist movement was rooted in his intimate connection with many White, working-class voters who felt deserted \u2014 culturally and economically by Democrats. But Trump doesn\u2019t seem ready to commit to any strategy that accepts his second term is not a roaring triumph.\n\u201cOur country is wealthy again and secure again,\u201d he said during a Cabinet meeting last week. \u201cThere\u2019s this fake narrative that the Democrats talk about affordability. They just say the word, it doesn\u2019t mean anything to anybody, just say, \u2018affordability.\u2019\u201d Trump may have a point here, although next year, newly elected Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia must live up to campaign promises to cut prices similar to ones the president made in 2024.\nTrump is also correct to say that inflation spiked under Biden. But his claims that he has halted the inflation rate are not true. It recentlyticked up to 2.8%, meaning the rate at which prices are going up is still rising. And an administration that takes pains to court corporations and the oligarchs of the tech industry is yet to convince working Americans it cares as much about them.\nTrump\u2019s frequent announcements of billions of dollars in investment in the US by foreign companies and states do look good \u2014 even if theydon\u2019t always live upto his billing. And even if such projects come off, they\u2019ll be a long-term proposition and won\u2019t ease prices quickly. Trump\u2019s pledge to appoint anew Federal Reserve chairwho will cut interest rates faster could lower mortgage rates and stimulate the housing market. But it could also unleash a new inflation crisis.\nWhile Trump insists everything is great now, some subordinates, including Vice President JD Vance, who as a potential future GOP presidential candidate must not alienate voters, are more nuanced in recognizing some Americans are hurting. But Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had a sunny prediction on Sunday. \u201cThe economy has been better than we thought,\u201d he told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Lashing out at \u201cembedded inflation\u201d left over from the Biden administration, he said: \u201cI think, next year, we\u2019re going to move on to prosperity.\u201d\nBut voters have heard blame games and optimism before. Successive elections have failed to deliver tangible change.

{"title":"Republicans worry Trump is missing the mark on affordability","date":"2025-12-11","body":"President Donald Trump\u2019shigh-profile economic speechon Tuesday night was meant to alleviate Americans\u2019 concerns about the cost of living.\nInstead, it mainly appeared to deepen fears within the GOP that he\u2019s not quite getting it.\nTrump made little effort toreboot his economic messageacross 90 minutes of winding remarks in Pennsylvania, alarming Republicans already worried that the party is headed for a wipeout in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nFaced with sagging approval ratings and rising voter anxiety, Trump insisted that the economy was booming and that prices were plummeting. He lamented the public\u2019s focus on affordability, while encouraging people to accept living with less.\nAnd with Republicans desperately seeking effective new ways to brighten voters\u2019 mood, Trump offered few signs that a solution would be coming from the top.\n\u201cTelling people they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in their lives is a mistake, and that won\u2019t work,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the right-leaning American Action Forum and a longtime Republican economic adviser. \u201cBut he\u2019s not going to change his tune, and his tune is not helpful at the moment.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s persistently rosy outlook on the economy \u2014 including again declaring affordability a \u201choax\u201d advanced by Democrats \u2014 has dented hopes that the president will be willing to substantially shift his messaging, despite clear warning signs and a concerted push by various aides and allies.\nWith Trump\u2019s focus abroad, Republicans push for midterms pivot to economy\nWithin Trump\u2019s orbit, even the more optimistic advisers described it only as a much-needed start, arguing that just getting the president back on the stump to tout his agenda represented a victory after months of focusing largely on matters abroad.\n\u201cWe need to get back on offense,\u201d said one Trump adviser.\nThe reviews in other corners of the GOP were more troubling, with lawmakers and strategists lamenting what they described as a widening disconnect between Trump and the rest of the party on a midterm defining challenge.\n\u201cThe first thing in terms of recovery is acknowledging there\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Matthew Bartlett, a GOP strategist and first-term Trump official. \u201cBeing an ostrich in politics and putting your head in the sand is never a good strategy, much less a winning strategy.\u201d\nTrump allies and GOP lawmakers had pressed officials toramp up the president\u2019s travelheaded into 2026, arguing that he needed to refocus his efforts on domestic issues and more actively promote an agenda that\u2019s unfamiliar to many Americans.\nThe president\u2019s speech on Tuesday represented the first of several the White House has billed as focused on affordability, as well as aimed at juicing enthusiasm among Trump voters that the GOP will need to hold control of Congress in November.\nYet Trump\u2019s return to campaign-style rallies comes as Republicans grapple with deteriorating support \u2014 and a growing belief among voters that on the economy, the president has fallen out of touch.\nIn polling, Trump\u2019s standing on the economy has sharply declined, driven by frustration with high prices, aslowing labor marketand the perception that conditions are getting worse. Republicans have also suffered a series of defeats in state and city-level races, in a sign that economically frustrated voters are rebelling against the party.\nCNN exit polls: Voters\u2019 dissatisfaction with Trump helped fuel Democratic wins in key races\nThose developments have prompted a scramble within the administration and on Capitol Hill to revamp the GOP\u2019s affordability message, with lawmakers newly focused on developing plans to address health care costs and other key pain points, while Trump aides try to amplify the few areas where prices have eased.\nWhite House officials in recent weeks have altered their rhetoric as well, more explicitly acknowledging the economic stressors still weighing on Americans while arguing that their agenda is slowly fixing it \u2014 and that people\u2019s financial stability is only going to improve in 2026.\n\u201cPresident Trump is stamping out Biden inflation for good, and we fully expect it to roll down next year,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said ahead of Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday. \u201cWhere Biden created scarcity, President Trump is creating abundance.\u201d\nYet for all the activity going on around him, Trump himself has yet to fully embrace that pivot, advisers said, bristling at the suggestion that his economy is not already a total success and expressing confidence that voters\u2019 spirits are bound to improve.\n\u201cHe has a bigger story that he hopes will, in a sense, overshadow and drown out affordability,\u201d said former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who remains close to the White House and congressional GOP leadership. He added that Trump believes \u201cyou\u2019re going to see a boom economy by next summer.\u201d\nIn Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Trump made brief allusions to his administration\u2019s new affordability script, acknowledging that prices \u201cwere\u201d high at one point and declaring that he had a simple message: \u201cThey caused the high prices and we\u2019re bringing them down.\u201d\nBut that stint was short-lived. Trump insisted repeatedly that he\u2019d revived the economy, at one point asserting it was already \u201cunbelievable.\u201d Earlier in the week, he deemed his performance on the economy an \u201cA-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\u201d And at a White House roundtable on Wednesday, he declared that \u201cthe economy is roaring.\u201d\nAcross much of the rest of the party, though, few share Trump\u2019s adamant optimism \u2014 and worry that it\u2019s increasingly unhelpful to the GOP\u2019s chances next year.\nAsked about Trump\u2019s message on affordability, GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito countered that in her state of West Virginia, \u201ca lot of people are still having trouble making ends meet.\u201d\nKansas Sen. Roger Marshall, a staunch White House ally, downplayed the president\u2019s remarks as a reaction to the intensifying focus on affordability among the press, \u201cand so he\u2019s pushing back the other way.\u201d Still, he declined to endorse Trump\u2019s outlook.\nIn a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that \u201cTrump\u2019s agenda is indeed delivering the booming economy that Americans enjoyed during his first term,\u201d pointing to private-sector investment commitments and lower inflation rates. \u201cBoth he and the Administration will continue to underscore the work we are doing to make this happen.\u201d\nBut within the GOP, there\u2019s little expectation that the path toward the midterms is getting easier any time soon.\nTrump advisers and lawmakers have privately fretted over the party\u2019s plan for what some describe as the \u201ctwo H\u2019s\u201d:Health careand housing costs, which they believe are driving much of voters\u2019 unhappiness.\nRepublicans, who are set to take a doomed health care vote on Thursday, have struggled to coalesce behind a plan for averting the expiration of key enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies at the end of the year.\nBattleground Republicans clash with hard-liners over Obamacare subsidies as party talks health care strategy\nThat expiration would further drive up health insurance premiums, heightening cost-of-living concerns without any consensus remedy for the GOP lawmakers to run on. As for housing, Republicans have few easy levers available that might make homes more affordable in just a matter of months.\nAnd while Trump on Tuesday touted a drop in gas prices and the easing price of eggs, Republicans cautioned that voters aren\u2019t going to buy into the president\u2019s success story until they feel it themselves.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s a great salesman, so he will sell what he\u2019s done,\u201d said Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has been among the most vocal Republican lawmakers in warning about the risk of an affordability backlash. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I come back to the fact that you can tell people until you\u2019re blue in the face that the facts are this, that or the other thing; they know what their checkbook says.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/11\/politics\/republicans-worry-trump-affordability-message","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s new executive order brings together Big Tech, academics and the government on AI research","date":"2025-11-24","body":"The White House on Monday launched a new program to allow the Department of Energy\u2019s national laboratories to collaborate with tech companies and academics on using AI to further scientific research.\nUnder the new Genesis Mission, created by executive order, the Department of Energy will develop a new AI platform that uses federal scientific data to train AI models and agents made for scientific research. It underscores President Donald Trump\u2019s focus on AI in his second term, coming after he\u2019s introduced a sweeping package of initiatives and policy recommendations in July called theAI Action Plan.\nThe Genesis Mission aims to take the tech and business industries\u2019 progress in AI and apply it to scientific research in health, energy, manufacturing and other fields, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on a call with reporters on Monday. He also said the program would lower energy prices for consumers, a key challenge as investment in AI have increased this year.\nThe DoE\u2019s laboratories have been conducting research in everything from energy to health, applied materials and quantum science for decades. But a new platform under the initiative will let DoE labs, private companies and academic institutions share information more easily. That, in turn, will help researchers apply AI to areas like physics and chemistry.\n\u201cThe private sector has launched artificial intelligence at huge scale, but with a little bit different focus, on language, on business, on processes, on consumer services.\u201d Wright said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is just pivoting those efforts to focus on scientific discovery, engineering advancements.\u201d\nA key part of accomplishing that goal, according to Wright, is opening up access to data sets from the DoE\u2019s national labs, which include facilities such as the Ames National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory among many others.\nThe platform will allow \u201cmultiple Federal research agencies\u201d and \u201cthe private sector\u201d to collaborate in order to \u201cwin and stay ahead in the AI race,\u201daccording to a White House fact sheet.\nKey focus areas for the program include biotechnology, critical materials, nuclear fission and fusion energy, space exploration, quantum information science, and semiconductors and microelectronics.\nTech giants have already been working more closely with the DoE; Nvidia and Oracleannounced a partnershipin October to build supercomputers for Argonne National Laboratory. PC maker Dell is also developing a supercomputer for use at Berkeley Lab, according toa May announcement.The Genesis Mission is designed to facilitate more of those types of deals.\nTech companies and academics have also been researching the use of AI in health for years; Google introduceda family of AI modelsfine-tuned for the healthcare industry in 2023.\nBut the push to use AI in scientific research also comes as the technology stillgrapples with hallucinations, or a tendency for the tech to make things up.\nThe directive also strikes at a critical issue brought up by the AI boom: the toll it could take on energy grids. Residential electricity costsare on the rise, with the average price of electricity in America increasing 13% since 2022. Data centers, which are critical for powering AI services and training AI models, are expected to consume approximately 6.7% to 12% of US electricity in 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023, according to a report from theDepartment of Energy.\nWright said the program would \u201cmake our electricity grid more efficient and reverse price rises that have infuriated American citizens.\u201d\nBut doing so won\u2019t be an easy task; power grids are already in need of updating and maintenance, especially in the face of severe weather events. And the rate at which AI is advancing could make it increasingly difficult for the energy industry to keep up as tech giants pour billions into new data centers.\nThe executive order is just the latest Trump initiative to accelerate US AI development. Just last week, Trump spoke at theSaudi-US investment forum in Washington, where a flurry of partnerships were announced between American tech companies and Humain AI, a tech company backed by Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.\nThe White House has also introduced unconventional arrangements that involve government dealings with private businesses as part of Trump\u2019s push for American AI dominance. The US governmenttook a 10% stake in chipmaker Intelin August and struck a deal with AMD and Nvidiato take a 15% cut of chip sales to Chinain exchange for export licenses.\nAt the heart of Trump\u2019s AI blitz is a desire to stay ahead of China in the AI race astrade tensions bubble between the two economic powerhouses. Chinese tech startup DeepSeek rattled US markets in January with the arrival of its R1 model, sparking fear that China may be further ahead in AI than previously expected.\nTrump and some tech giantslike OpenAIhave argued that state-level regulation could slow innovation. Trump recently drafteda separate executive orderaimed at preventing such regulation, after Congress shot down a previous effort to block state-level AI regulations.\nBut easing regulation has raised safety concerns from lawmakers and online safety advocates after a series of reports this year indicated AI could contribute toself-harmandmental distress.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/24\/tech\/ai-executive-order","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"\u2018Cooperation looks different today\u2019: WEF president on growth, technology and developing economies","date":"2025-12-10","body":"The global economy is \u201cundergoing one of itsmost turbulentperiods in decades,\u201d according to a recent World Economic Forum (WEF) report, with geopolitical instability, trade realignments, and technological advancements accelerating a reconfiguration of the economic order.\nIt notes that almost nine in 10 of surveyed chief economists foresee growth in advanced economies depending primarily on access to technology and know-how, but they expect developing countries to continue to depend more on capital and natural resources.\nAhead of the WEF annual meeting next January, its president and CEO B\u00f8rge Brende spoke to CNN at the Doha Forum, in Qatar, about the challenges facing the global economy.\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nCNN: What do you predict will be the priorities and global challenges that will dominate the 2026 World Economic Forum?\nB\u00f8rge Brende:Our theme of the meeting is the spirit of dialogue. What we need more of in this world is for people to talk to each other and try to solve common challenges.\nThe world isn\u2019t looking that bad. We still have more than 3% economic growth, and we think that new technologies, especially artificial intelligence, will also increase productivity and lead to growth in the future.\nLike trade was a growth engine for decades, we think new technologies can do that and then we can see more prosperity.\nCNN: Do you believe that global cooperation is still possible in an era defined by fragmentation and mistrust?\nBrende:Cooperation is still indispensable, but it looks different from in the past. In the past it was easier to get multilateral agreements, meaning that all countries came together and they agreed on something.\nToday, we will see cooperation in a different way. Countries that have things in common will come together in so-called \u201cplurilaterals\u201d and then they will move. But not all the UN members will move in the same configuration.\nWe are seeing that organizations and countries are adapting to a new reality that (it) is a more competitive world.\nCNN: How can the WEF ensure developing countries have a seat at the table rather than being the subject of the discussion?\nBrende:It\u2019s very important that we see substantial growth in the developing countries and also in emerging economies.\nI\u2019m overall optimistic when it comes to developing countries seeing substantial growth in the years to come. They have a young population; they have good dividend when it comes to human capital.\nBut there are of course obstacles to overcome, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.\nWe want to secure a continuation of foreign direct investments to developing countries, and we have to avoid any kind of war.

{"title":"How to profit from the Fed\u2019s latest interest rate pause","date":"2025-01-29","body":"The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesdayto keep its overnight bank lending rate where it is\u2014 following a full percentage point cut last year \u2014 means you still have an opportunity to enjoy solid, inflation-beating returns on your savings if you\u2019re smart about where you put them.\nAt the same time, because the Fed\u2019s rate moves (or inaction) can directly or indirectly influence rates on a range of consumer loans and financial products, you\u2019ll want to do what you can to limit the interest payments on your debts so you don\u2019t spend a dollar more than necessary.\n\u201cBorrowers shouldn\u2019t bank on the Fed being in any hurry to cut interest rates again, so focus on paying down high-cost debt. On the bright side, savers will continue to enjoy returns that outpace inflation if the money is parked in the most competitive (accounts),\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analystatBankrate.\nHere are some recommended ways to accomplish both your savings and debt goals.\nMost people with savings accounts at the biggest banks settle for paltry returns on their money \u2014 the national average interest rate on savings accounts is just 0.55%, according to Bankrate.\nBut you can do far better if you put the bulk of your savings \u2014 including your emergency fund money and any money you\u2019ll need for near-term goals like an upcoming vacation or unexpected expense like a car repair \u2014 in an online high-yield savings accountinsured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nRelated articleFed hits pause on interest rate cuts\nSome have been paying between 4.5% to 4.75% in the past week. That means your money can grow faster thaninflation, which at last reading was pacing at roughly 3%.\nAlternatively, you might consider an FDIC-insured money market account. Some have rates as high as 4% to 4.75%, according to Bankrate.\nAnother option might be a money market mutual fund, which investsin short-term, low-risk debt instruments. Such funds are offering an average return of 4.19% this week, according to Crane Data. While money market funds are not insured by the FDIC, if you invest through your brokerage, your overall account is likely to beinsured by the Securities Investor Protection Corp.\nFor savings that you don\u2019t necessarily need within three to six months but want access to in the next three to five years for intermediate-term goals like having a down payment to buy a home or helping to pay for your living expenses in the first year or two of retirement, you might consider certificates of deposit, US Treasuries or AAA-rated municipal bonds. Each have different tax implications and different rules for early withdrawals.\nFDIC-insured CDs require you to lock up your money for a given period of time, and the earnings are fully taxable at both the federal and state level. CDs ranging in duration from three months to five years were yielding between 4.25% and 4.65%on Wednesday ahead of the Fed meeting, according to options listed on Schwab.com.\nUS Treasuries of durations between three months and five years were offering yields between4.19% and 4.34%. Interest earned from Treasuries is exempt from state and local taxes, so may be a better option if you live in a high-tax area.\nAnd AAA-rated municipal bonds with durations of three months to five years were paying between 2.61% and 4.21%, according to offerings on Schwab.com. Earnings on munis are typically exempt from federal tax. And if you buy one issued by the state where you file your state taxes, it may be exempt from state and local taxes too, according to TurboTax. So high-quality munis can be a good option if you\u2019re in a high tax bracket, live in a high-tax area or live in a state with little to no income taxes and want an inflation-beating after-tax return.\nBarring a sudden economic downturn, Fed watchers do not expect the Fed to cut its key rate again for many months. And if there is arise in inflation, as some expect may occur as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs, it\u2019s also possible that the Fedmight even raise rates.\nSo you can pretty much count on the interest payments you make on your debts to remain costly \u2014 unless you proactively try to reduce their impact.\nRelated articleTrump just gave his clearest picture yet of what new tariffs could look like\n\u201cAnyone hoping [the Fed will] rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed. That\u2019s true whether you\u2019re talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else,\u201d said LendingTree credit expert Matt Schultz. \u201cThat means it is maybe more important than ever to get that high-interest debt under control.\u201d\nBeyond the suggestions below on how to do that, you will always improve your chances of securing a more favorable interest rate on any loan you seek when you have a good credit score. \u201cIt is quite possible that there will be fewer rate cuts over the course of (this) year than anticipated only a few months ago,\u201d said Michele Ranieri, a vice president at TransUnion. \u201cConsumers should continue to monitor their own credit scores and credit reports to make sure they are in the best possible position to act when rates do come down.\u201d\nYour credit cards:The average variable rate on credit cards is currently 20.14%, down a hair from 20.35% when the Fed met last December, and lower than the 20.79% record high set in August 2024, according to Bankrate.\nAnd for new cards being issued, the average rate tops 24%, according to Lending Tree.\nIn all cases, such rates are punitively high if you\u2019re not able to pay off your credit card bill in full and on time every month.\nThere are a few ways to reduce your burden. First and best among them is to apply for a 0% balance transfer card, which would let you meaningfully pay down your principal over the next 12 to 18 months without incurring any interest charges.\nIf that\u2019s not an option, Schultz thinks consolidating all your high-rate credit card debt  into a personal loan with a much lower rate can make a big difference to your bottom line. The average rate on a personal loan was 12.46% as of January 22, according to Bankrate. But the higher your credit score and the lower your debt-to-income ratio, the better your rate will be, especially if you comparison shop for the most favorable loan.\nAnd lastly, if neither of those options work, call your credit card issuer and ask them to lower your rate. \u201cIt works more often than you might think,\u201d Schultz said.\nYour home:Mortgage rates are most directly tied to movement in the 10-year US Treasury yield, which is influenced by economic factors such as inflation and growth expectations, in addition to anticipation of the Fed\u2019s next action.\nSo even though the Fed cut its key rate three times last year, mortgage rates didn\u2019t follow suit and in some instancesare even a little higherthan where they were a year ago.\n\u201cIf the Fed were to cut the Fed funds rate, bonds could go either way. It would be the same if they were to raise rates. There are a lot of unknowns at the moment,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage.\nAs of January 23, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.96%, down from the week prior when it averaged 7.04%, according to Freddie Mac. A year ago, the 30-year averaged 6.69%.\nSo if you\u2019re carrying a mortgage with a rate well above 7%, you might do the math to see if it pays to refinance your loan to secure a lower rate. McBride suggests that if you\u2019re able to cut your rate by at least one-half to three-quarters of a percentage point, a refi may be worth considering.\nIf you\u2019ve borrowed against your home equity, it likely is not cheap money and won\u2019t get cheaper anytime soon. As of January 22, per Bankrate, the average rate on a home equity loan was 8.45% and the average rate on a home equity line of credit was 8.28%.\nUnless you have secured a loan that is considerably cheaper, making an effort to pay down what you\u2019ve borrowed as soon as feasible can save you real money in the long run.\nIf you\u2019re thinking of getting a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline \u2014 and so potentially may never tap it \u2014 the rate may be less of a concern. But know that you may still have to part with some money to maintain the credit line, in terms of closing costs, minimum withdrawal requirements or ancillary expenses, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee.\nYour car:Average interest rates on new car loans (7.1%) and used car loans (10.8%) as of December were each down about half a percentage point from where they were before the Fed started cutting rates in September 2024, according to data from car site Edmunds.com.\nBut that is not enough of a drop to justify refinancing an existing car loan you may have got in the past year or two. Here\u2019s why: A full percentage point drop might only save you $16 a month on a $35,000 car loan, according to Bankrate.\nOne possible exception, however, is if you have an existing loan at a very high rate \u2014 e.g., 15% or more \u2014 and in the time since you got that loan your credit score has greatly improved. \u201cThen it might be worth considering,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.com.\nFor anyone who plans to purchase a car in the next several months, she said, don\u2019t assume you\u2019ll get a better deal buying a used car. That\u2019s because loans for new cars and certified pre-owned cars often come with subsidized loan incentives, which along with the latest drop in rates might result in better savings for you than a specific used car loan you\u2019re considering. Her advice: Shop around to see what you can get. And thendo the mathto figure out how much you will be paying in interest over the life of the loan.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/29\/business\/profit-fed-interest-rate-pause","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s $2,000 tariff dividend may be a smart political move. But it would be a huge economic gamble","date":"2025-11-11","body":"One of the only things that polls worse than the Trump economy is the president\u2019s almost unprecedented use of tariffs.\nThe White House, in an apparent bid to turn sentiment around on both the economy and tariffs, isonce againfloating a bold idea: redeploying tariff revenue to fund$2,000 dividend checksto lower- and middle-income Americans.\nIt\u2019s easy to see how these tariff rebate payments couldwin over skeptical votersand help people who are struggling financially. Yet beyond the political appeal, it\u2019s hard to make sense of the economic logic behind this idea.\nEconomists tell CNN that tariffs are unlikely to generate enough revenue to pay for dividend payments the size President Donald Trump has promised.\nIf all the tariff revenue is blown on dividend payments, there would be nothing left to chip away at the $38 trillion national debt \u2013 one of Trump\u2019s other promises. Depending on how they are structured, dividend payments could even add to America\u2019s mountain of debt.\nIf rebate checks are distributed, history shows that many Americans would likely spend some or all of their cash from Uncle Sam. This would increase demand without boosting supply, which could worsen the cost-of-living problem at the heart of Americans\u2019 frustrations with the economy.\nTrump floats $2,000 tariff rebate checks. What you need to know\n\u201cAll of this is exactly the wrong recipe if you want to get inflation under control and make things feel more affordable,\u201d Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, told CNN in a phone interview.\nThe risk of raising prices is why direct payments, typically called stimulus checks, are normally reserved for emergencies when demand is low \u2013 such as during the 2008 financial crisis or the Covid pandemic.\nEven during the pandemic, stimulus checks may have been partly to blame for the ensuing inflation crisis. The St. Louis Federal Reserveestimatedthat US fiscal stimulus during Covid contributed 2.6 percentage points to annual inflation.\nOf course, the US economy today is in a very different place: Unemployment is relatively low. Consumer spending has been resilient, albeit unequal.\nPolls as well as recent election results underscore how upset many Americans are with the cost of living. For example, a recent Washington Postpollfound that only 37% of US adults approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy. Far more, 62%, disapprove.\nIt\u2019s hard to square Trump\u2019s oft-statedclaimthat the United States is the \u201chottest country anywhere in the world\u201d with his call for spending hundreds of billions of dollars on dividend payments.\nKeep in mind that many Americans are expected to receive larger tax refunds this spring due to Trump\u2019s sweeping tax and spending cut law.\n\u201cThe risk is if you add a stimulus check on top of a tax cut refund, you\u2019re going to overheat the economy. You could overdo it,\u201d said Michael Pearce, deputy chief US economist at Oxford Economics.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs are even less popular than his handling of the economy, according to the Post poll: Roughly two-thirds disapprove.\nBut it\u2019s absolutely true that tariff revenue has skyrocketed since Trump took office.\nThe federal government has already collected $36 billion in tariff revenue since the fiscal year started October 1, according to US Treasury Department data. That\u2019s more than triple what was collected at this point last fiscal year.\nSince Trump took office, the federal government has collected $221 billion in total tariff revenue (both preexisting tariffs and new ones).\nThe administration has not laid out specifics for Trump\u2019s tariff dividend proposal. According to York of the Tax Foundation, even if children were excluded and the income cutoff was $100,000, dividend checks would cost roughly $300 billion.\nThat is far above the $217 billion in new tariff revenue the Tax Foundation has projected for 2026.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unrealistic idea,\u201d York said.\nYork also estimated that about three-quarters of the projected tariff revenue could get derailed if theSupreme Court rules againstTrump\u2019s use of emergency powers to slap tariffs on imports.\nThe White House did not respond to questions from CNN about who would qualify for a tariff dividend payment, what such a program would cost, or whether the administration has analyzed the impact on inflation and the federal deficit.\nHowever, a White House official defended the trade agenda.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s tariffs are resetting global commerce, securing manufacturing investments, and safeguarding our national and economic security \u2013 and they\u2019re also raising billions in revenue for the federal government,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people.\u201d\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, who served in the administration of President George W. Bush when tax rebate checks were delivered in 2001, said the Trump idea \u201cmakes no sense.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no economic foundation to this. I doubt any of it is going to work,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin, now president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank.\nJustin Wolfers, economics professor at the University of Michigan, told CNN in a phone interview that it makes no sense to tax people with tariffs \u2013 and then give people the money back in the form of checks.\n\u201cThis is insane, unfair, pointless and dumb,\u201d Wolfers said. \u201cIf tariffs are making Americans poorer, the simplest and fairest way to stop that is not to tariff.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/11\/business\/trump-dividend-payment-tariff-stimulus","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The federal government is buying chunks of private companies anddemanding cuts of revenue streams. Presidential power to lob tariffs has been wielded in unprecedented fashion. And federal regulators are threatening media companies over late-night comics.\nThese events all took place this year, and not in a third-world country, but in the world\u2019s preeminent democracy under President Donald Trump.\nSome political scientists see a pattern that suggests American democracy is being undermined in real time. The stakes are massive for the US economy and the business world.\n\u201cI have never been this concerned about democracy in the United States,\u201d Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow of governance studies at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CNN in a phone interview.\nCEOs are growing alarmed \u2014 even if they\u2019re publicly staying quiet to avoid the wrath of the White House.\nBusiness leaders are \u201cquite alarmed\u201d in private about the state of democracy in the United States, according to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the Yale professor known as the\u201cCEO Whisperer\u201ddue to his extensive rolodex in the business community.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a serious erosion of the foundations of democracy,\u201d Sonnenfeld, founder and president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, told CNN.\nResearch shows that democracies tend to thrive financially.\n\u201cDemocracy is just good for the economy. And autocracy is bad for the economy,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cAutocrats are just not good at managing economies. Policymaking tends to be erratic as democratic institutions decline.\u201d\nDemocratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20% in the long run, according to a 2019studytitled \u201cDemocracy does cause growth\u201d that was published in the Journal of Political Economy, a University of Chicago peer-reviewed journal.\nResearchers said the positive effects of democracy \u201cappear to be driven by greater investment in capital, schooling and health.\u201d\nOn the other hand, scholars have found countries governed by populists are worse off.\n\u201cPopulist leaders leave a long-lasting negative imprint on the economic and political pathways of countries,\u201d researchers concluded in a 2023studypublished by the American Economic Review.\nThey studied 51 populist presidents and prime ministers who were in power between 1900 and 2020 and found that after 15 years, GDP per capita was 10% lower when compared with a plausible nonpopulist counterfactual.\n\u201cPopulists typically assume office as antiestablishment politicians who claim to represent \u2018the common people\u2019 and to improve their economic fortunes,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cHowever, they typically do not deliver.\u201d\nWilliamson, the Brookings fellow, argued the United States \u201cexperienced democratic erosion slowly\u201d in recent years and \u201crapidly this year.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s troubling is we\u2019re trending in the direction of the worst-case scenarios I\u2019ve envisioned,\u201d she said.\nIn a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai argued the Trump administration is \u201crestoring confidence and economic dynamism\u201d by pointing to \u201ctrillions\u201d of dollars of investment commitments from Apple, Nvidia, Merck and other global corporations.\n\u201cThese political \u2018scientists\u2019 should\u2019ve spoken up during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, when Biden officials eroded American democracy by pressuring social media companies to censor Americans\u2019 free speech, by flooding our country with tens of millions of illegal aliens, and by weaponizing the justice system against political opponents \u2013 on top of inflicting the worst inflation crisis on everyday Americans in decades,\u201d Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is correcting government overreach, incompetence, and weaponization while implementing the most aggressive pro-growth economic agenda in modern American history.\u201d\nThe latest flashpoint: Brendan Carr, the Trump-nominated chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, suggested the regulator would make life difficult for Disney and ABC if they didn\u2019t take action to address on-air remarks comedian Jimmy Kimmel made about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\nKimmel\u2019s show was later suspended indefinitely by ABC in a move that was hailed by Trump.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you would expect to see in an unfree country. It\u2019s straight from the autocratic playbook,\u201d Williamson said.\nSonnenfeld said Trump\u2019s threats to pull broadcast licenses over critical coverage of the administration is \u201chorrifying.\u201d\n\u201cThe erosion of free expression in the media is really alarming,\u201d Sonnenfeld said.\nTrump has surprised some by the intensity of his attacks on the Federal Reserve, which is designed to be independent from political interference.\nLast month, Trump fired Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who has fought back in court.\nAfter abrutal jobs reporton August 1, Trump fired the leader of the agency that compiles the report and accused her, without evidence, of cooking the books.\nErika McEntarfer, the fired commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, saidlast week the firing \u201cmade no sense.\u201d\n\u201cFiring your chief statistician is a dangerous step,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an attack on the independence of an institution arguably as important as the Federal Reserve for economic stability. It has serious economic consequences.\u201d\nTrump has also surprised some by taking a heavy-handed approach with private businesses.\nFor instance, Trumpdemanded the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tanover his ties to China.\nTrump later praised the Intel CEO and presided over a controversial decision toinvest taxpayer money in the $8.9 billion in the beleaguered chipmaker.\nAlthough the Intel investment won praise from Sen. Bernie Sanders, some Republicans are troubled.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been teaching the world that state-owned enterprises are unfair. But now Intel is a state-owned enterprise,\u201d Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, told CNN in a phone interview.\nHoltz-Eakin, the president of center-right think tank American Action Forum, told CNN the government is \u201coverstepping boundaries\u201d by taking stakes in private companies.\n\u201cNow Intel has deeper pockets than anyone else. And politically, we\u2019re never going to let Intel fail. We can\u2019t admit it was a bad idea,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government should stay out.\u201d\nThe Intel investment came months after the Trump administration approved Nippon Steel\u2019s takeover of US Steel in a deal thatgranted the federal government a \u201cgolden share\u201dthat could give US officials a say in how the private enterprise is run.\nIn July, the Department of Defensebecame the largest shareholderin MP Materials, a publicly traded company andthe nation\u2019s largest rare earths miner.\nMike Pence, Trump\u2019s former vice president, noted onCNBClast week that \u201cstate ownership of business is very common in China and Russia\u201d \u2014 two nations that are far from democracies.\nSuch moves have \u201ctaken our country to a very perilous place and I think we need to resist that very strongly,\u201d Pence said.\nSonnenfeld, the Yale professor, went a step further by describing the federal government\u2019s \u201cintrusion\u201d into the private sector.\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if MAGA has gone Maoist, if not Marxist,\u201d Sonnenfeld said.\nPublicly, most business leaders have been relatively quiet about these issues.\nCEOs know that if they speak up, they risk drawing the ire of the president.\nIn May,Trump threatened to slap a 100% tariffon all of Mattel\u2019s imports after the toymaker\u2019s CEO acknowledged it would have to consider price hikes due to tariffs.\nBut in private, Sonnenfeld says, CEOs have expressed major concern about pressure on democracy in the United States.\nThe Yale professor said the business community is \u201csplintering,\u201d meeting with the president sector by sector instead of speaking with one voice.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing those forceful voices come together,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBut they need to.

{"title":"In its rivalry with the US, China sees an advantage: the long game","date":"2025-10-24","body":"Chinese leaders have just concluded aclosed-door conclavefocused on drawing up the country\u2019s next five-year economic blueprint \u2013 a sweeping plan covering everything from accelerating tech innovation to streamlining how China\u2019s farms grow food.\nStakes are high for formulating that strategy, with Chinese officials under pressure to reduce reliance on imported technology and address economic weaknesses as the country faces a deepening rivalry with the US.\nBut drawing up the plan \u2013 especially at a moment when Washington remainsimmobilized by a government shutdownover spending for the current fiscal year \u2013 also gives leader Xi Jinping an opportunity to showcase a source of his confidence in China\u2019s rise: the authoritarian country\u2019s ability to produce \u2013 and deliver on \u2013 far-reaching visions.\nChinese state media and officials have not been delicate about playing up what they see as that competitive advantage in recent days.\n\u201cScientifically formulating and continuously implementing the five-year plan is \u2026 a key political advantage of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Many foreign political parties envy us for this,\u201d Jiang Jinquan, an official with the Communist Party Central Committee\u2019s Policy Research Office, said at a press briefing Friday, adding that such plans were essential for \u201cgaining strategic initiative in the midst of intense international competition.\u201d\nAcommentaryin the Communist Party mouthpiece People\u2019s Daily published Thursday praised how China \u201cviews the whole country as one chessboard\u2026 and continues to advance steadily along the correct direction,\u201d while \u201csome countries remain trapped in the shortsightedness and constant policy reversals under multiparty systems.\u201d\n\u201cLong-termism,\u201d a blend of continuity and flexibility, is something \u201cWestern countries find difficult to match,\u201d anotherarticle, in state media agency Xinhua, quoted Tsinghua University professor Yan Yilong as saying.\nA separatecommentarypublished by Beijing Daily, meanwhile, spotlighted the \u201cout of control\u201d situation in the US, pointing to the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests, the government shutdown, and a controversialAI-generated video memeshared by US President Donald Trump last weekend.\nIt concluded: \u201cThe (American) halo is illusory, and the myth is fragile. To use Trump\u2019s own words: The United States has become a failed state in many ways and is \u2018dying from within.\u2019\u201d\nSuch rhetoric is, of course, not unusual within China\u2019s tightly controlled propaganda environment. And officials have long looked to play up the ills of other countries, especially the US, to boost their own image for domestic and, increasingly, international audiences.\nBut the sentiment also reflects the thinking of the country\u2019s ruling Communist Party \u2013 and its leader Xi \u2013 at a moment when the two countries are sparring over tech and trade as they grapple with how to structure their economic relationship and rivalry.\nAnd the chance to amplify that sentiment, through the pomp of crafting the upcoming five-year plan, couldn\u2019t come at a better moment for Xi, days ahead of a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea, and weeks after China reignited US ire by expanding itsrare earths export control regime.\nFull details of the upcoming five-year plan will not be released until after its approval by China\u2019s rubber-stamp legislature in March. But an overview of the priorities approved by a powerful Communist Party committee that met over four days this week exuded confidence in China\u2019s continued rise.\n\u201cWe will strive for another five years to achieve a significant leap forward in our country\u2019s economic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, national defense strength, comprehensive national power, and international influence by 2035,\u201d a communique released by state media Thursday said.\nOfficials would \u201caccelerate the development of building China\u2019s strength in manufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, and cyberspace.\u201d\nLeaders signaled they would stay the course on \u201caccelerating high-level scientific and technological self-reliance\u201d and infusing high tech into industry \u2013 building on China\u2019s current efforts to upgrade its manufacturing and capacity to innovate.\n\u201cThe proposals advocate for a forward-looking layout for future industries, promoting quantum technology, biotechnology, hydrogen energy, nuclear fusion, brain-computer interfaces, embodied intelligence, and sixth-generation mobile communications as new drivers of economic growth,\u201d Zheng Shanjie, head of China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters Friday.\nThe signaling following the meeting in Beijing suggested China would double down on its position as a manufacturing and industrial powerhouse, despite longstanding views from some analysts that it should transition to a services-driven economy as many developed economies have. The communique also stressed the importance of national security and the need to \u201caccelerate the building of advanced combat capabilities\u201d for the military.\nOfficials pointed to efforts to address challenges like flagging domestic consumption, socioeconomic inequality and \u201cinvolution\u201d \u2013 or cutthroat domestic competition linked to overcapacity. China would \u201cvigorously boost consumption\u201d and \u201cimprove the social security system,\u201d as well as further opening China\u2019s market to international players, according to the communique.\nHow officials precisely plan to achieve these goals will only become clearer over the coming months and years.\nObservers have long noted the ability of China\u2019s tightly controlled system to achieve far-reaching goals.\nThe country has raised hundreds of millions out of poverty, transformed into the world\u2019s second-largest economy and a global growth engine, and more recently emerged as a technological powerhouse and a proponent of the green transition across the world.\nAnd as the US shakes up its own foreign and domestic policy under Trump, Beijing is also touting China\u2019s planning as proof that it, not the US, is a responsible global leader.\n\u201cIn today\u2019s global environment, some major powers frequently change their policies, and such \u2018unpredictability\u2019 has cast a shadow over world peace and development,\u201d an editorial in state-backed tabloid Global Times published Friday said.\n\u201cThe development roadmap unveiled in the communique for China\u2019s next five years offers the world something truly rare in these turbulent times \u2013 certainty,\u201d it added.\nChinese electric cars are going global. A cut-throat price war at home could kill off many of its brands\nUnlike in Western democracies, where visions for a country are articulated by leaders elected by popular vote \u2013 and can often be voted down by opposition lawmakers \u2013 China\u2019s five-year plans are crafted in the upper echelons of the Communist Party, ostensibly with what Beijing calls \u201cmass consultation\u201d with various sectors of society. Xi sits \u201cat the helm\u201d of this process, according to state media.\nOnce set, five-year plans act as marching orders for officials across the sprawling apparatus of the government and a guide for businesses, universities and other organizations on how to align their own strategies with the party\u2019s.\nSuch plans have at times had disastrous consequences. The \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d associated with the second five-year plan of 1958, that was supposed to drive China\u2019s industrialization, instead drove the country into famine, killing an estimated tens of millions of people.\nMore recently, plans have spurred China\u2019s energetic efforts to build out new industries like green technology and electric vehicles and upgrade factory production, but also shown some of the drawbacks of state-backed planning.\nTake EVs, for example. China now dominates the sector globally, yet state support has also created artificial market saturation, driving price wars and an ongoing wave of company failures.\nBut for Xi, who is determined not to see China\u2019s rise hindered by Western export controls and trade barriers, it\u2019s clear that the power to chart out a vision, to deliver with a deadline in 2030, underlines his faith that his system will ultimately win out.\nOr in his own words, as recently quoted in state media, when it comes to China\u2019s \u201crevitalization,\u201d this planning creates \u201ca vital political advantage.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/24\/china\/china-fourth-plenum-five-year-plan-analysis-intl-hnk","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Just 34% say they feel enthusiastic or optimistic. Overall, 69% of the public considers an economic recession in the next year to be at least somewhat likely, including 32% who say that\u2019s very likely.\nTrump took credit for bringing costs down. \u201cI was able to get down the costs. But even that, it takes a while to get them down. But we got them down good,\u201d he said.\nAverage grocery prices were about 2.41% higher in March 2025 than they were in March 2024,Consumer Price Index data shows. This was the highest year-over-year grocery inflation rate since August 2023.\nWelker asked Trump if he would \u201ctake responsibility\u201d for the volatile stock market, which steeply declined after he announced sweeping, reciprocal tariffs.\n\u201cI\u2019ve only just been here for a little more than three months. But the stock market, look at what\u2019s happened in the last short period of time. Didn\u2019t it have nine or 10 days in a row, or 11 days, where it\u2019s gone up? And the tariffs have just started kicking in. And we\u2019re doing really well,\u201d Trump said.\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 closed at 5,686.67, down 6% since January 21, the first trading session of Trump\u2019s term. On April 9, the S&P surged 9.5%, its best daily performance in nearly 17 years, after Trump paused tariffs on most nations.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen with the market? I can\u2019t tell you, but I can tell you, our country has gotten a lot stronger, and eventually it\u2019ll be a country like no other,\u201d Trump said on April 6,while downplayingstock losses and adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\u201d\nTrump has provided little reassurance to Americans and business owners about the short- and long-term effects of his economic policies, like the imposed145% tariff on Chinese imports, the removal of thede minimis exemption, rounds of tariffs onauto importsand a universal10% tariffrate during the90-day pauseon most reciprocal tariffs.\nWelker asked Trump, \u201cYou\u2019re not taking the possibility that (some of) these tariffs could be permanent off the table?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t do that. Because if somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?\u201d Trump said.\nWhile he\u2019s provided some relief to major companies, particularly car makers that receiveddelayson tariffs and are nowallowed somereimbursementson imported car parts, Trump declined to provide relief for small businesses.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to need it,\u201d he told Welker.\nTrump said he does \u201ctake responsibility for everything,\u201d adding that \u201cthe tariffs are going to make us rich. We\u2019re going to be a very rich country.\u201d\nBut concerns about the impact of tariffs have caused an increasing number of Americans to worry about apotential recession.\nIn April, JPMorgan said the odds of a recession were 60%, up from 40%. Goldman Sachs said the odds of a recession were 45%.\n\u201cEverything\u2019s OK,\u201d Trump told Welker. \u201cThis is a transition period. I think we\u2019re going to do fantastically.\u201d\nTrump added that he is not worried about a recession. But when asked if he thinks a recession could happen, he said, \u201cAnything can happen.\u201d\nWelker asked Trump about rising prices on goods due to tariffs. Trump said consumers may need to purchase fewer goods.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that a beautiful baby girl needs \u2026 to have 30 dolls.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nFire the economists. Sue the Fed chair. Meddle in private businesses. Consider suspending economic reports. Demand fealty. Take over police in the capital. Tell everyone it\u2019s for their own good.\nThis is what the end of American free-market capitalism could look like. Over the past several days, President Donald Trump has taken steps \u2014 unprecedented in American history, but well established in China, Russia and other centrally managed economies \u2014 to break the institutions that define and sustain our economic reality.\nIt\u2019s about to get very messy. Or rather,messier.\nHere\u2019s a sampling of just the pasttwo days:\nThat\u2019s a lot to process, which is, of course, the point of the White House\u2019s flood-the-zone media strategy.\nSo let\u2019s zoom in briefly on the thing thatseemsthe most boring but is actually critical: Trump\u2019s campaign to sow doubt around the economic data produced by the BLS.\nAs we reportedherelast week, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a Trump lackey in any position to fudge the jobs numbers and present a rosier economic picture \u2014 there\u2019d be a mutiny among the civil servants who take pride in collecting and analyzing that data. There\u2019s a century\u2019s worth of procedural integrity there that can\u2019t be easily tossed aside.\nIt\u2019s much easier, then, to publicly bash the institution itself and tap an economist who\u2019s been critical of the very organization he\u2019s been asked to oversee.\nWhile he retracted his comment, Antonitold Fox Businessin an interview before his nominationthat he believes it may be time to suspend the monthly report \u201cuntil it is corrected.\u201d\nIt\u2019s difficult to overstate how nervous that kind of talk makes business leaders and economists. While few would say the BLS process is perfect, it is undeniably the best way anyone knows how to keep tabs on the sprawling, $30 trillion US economy.\n\u201cSuppressing this data is like gouging out our eyes,\u201d said Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist and senior researcher at the WE Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. \u201cIt hurts our ability to understand what\u2019s happening around us and forces us into make worse decisions.\u201d\nThis is hardly some academic or theoretical concern.\nJust ask Argentina, whose government in 2007fired the statistician in charge of its inflation reportafter she (correctly) projected a big increase in consumer prices. After that, elected officials spent years trying to trick the public, saying inflation was lower than it was. Investors lost trust and pulled their money out of Argentine bonds. Borrowing rates skyrocketed.\nWhile there\u2019s no evidence anything similar is under way in the United States now, the damage may already be done.\nWhen the August jobs report comes out, three weeks from now, it will be digested in the context of Trump\u2019s reaction. A rosy report will raise questions on the left about whether the agency is placating the president, the way law firms, universities and multinational corporations have done. A gloomy report will be seen on the right as a proof of a plot to undermine Trump\u2019s economic agenda.\nTrump\u2019s realignment of American business also bears similarities to China\u2019s model of \u201cstate capitalism\u201d \u2014 a mix between socialism and classic free-market capitalism in which the state is involved in, but doesn\u2019t directly own, private businesses.\n\u201cA generation ago conventional wisdom held that as China liberalized, its economy would come to resemble America\u2019s. Instead, capitalism in America is starting to look like China,\u201dWall Street Journal columnist Greg Ipwrote Monday. Of course, the US hasn\u2019t gone as far as China or even what Ip calls \u201cmilder practitioners of state capitalism\u201d like Russia and Brazil.\n\u201cIt is still a sea change from the free market ethos the US once embodied.\u201d\nIn China, the ministries that produce its economic data are aligned with the party in power (which makes sense in a one-party system). And it\u2019s not unusual for Beijing\u2019s official stats to diverge from indicators tracked by academics and research firms. That is, if the national stats are published at all. In recent years, China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics has stopped publishing some numbers related to unemployment, with little explanation, according to a separateWSJ analysis.\nTo be sure, the US is nowhere near that level. But Trump, who has spoken openly of his admiration for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, isn\u2019t just lashing out at the numbers on social media the way he has in the past.\nIt\u2019s no secret Trump cares deeply about optics, and he very much does not want to be held accountable for \u201cbad\u201d numbers. Remember his fixation withhis 2016 inauguration crowds?

The result, nearly eight months into his second term, is an economy that appears to be lurching into a new era of state control.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/08\/13\/business\/trump-economy-capitalism-nightcap","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s sweeping agenda injects uncertainty into a healthy economy","date":"2025-01-21","body":"When President Barack Obama took the oath of office in January 2009, unemployment was surging, markets were plunging and families were losing their homes. He inherited an economic calamity.\nPresident Donald Trump has been dealt a far stronger hand \u2013 even as he returns to the White House vowing to dramatically reshape the American economy through a flurry of executive action and sweeping legislation.\nThe unemployment rate ended 2024 at just 4.1%. The only incoming presidents to inherit a lower unemployment rate were President George W. Bush in January 2001 and President Richard Nixon in January 1969.\nAlthough the cost of living remains a major frustration and risks of reigniting inflation remain, the US economy is broadly in good shape as Trump takes power. The jobs market is enjoying ahistoric period of uninterrupted growth, wage increases are beating price gains and overall growth continues to defy expectations.\n\u201cThe president is inheriting a very healthy economy,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\nOne thing that could cool the US economy off a bit is the sheer amount of uncertainty that is being injected into the economy right now.\nIt\u2019s natural to have some uncertainty when there is a change in power in Washington, with the new party bringing in their own ideas and philosophies.\nYet Trump is starting his second term with a bang, enacting a flurry of executive actions on his first day covering everything from energy and immigration to how the federal government functions.\nTrump has promised that this is just the beginning, vowing toimpose massive tariffs, slash a breathtaking amount of red tape and provide new tax breaks to businesses and individuals.\n\u201cUncertainty is a tax on the economy,\u201d said JPMorgan\u2019s Kelly. \u201cIn football you may want to keep your opponent in the dark. But if you\u2019re managing an economy, you want to make your plans clear. If you don\u2019t, people may wait to make decisions and that tends to slow the economy down.\u201d\nQuestions continue to swirl over Trump\u2019s trade agenda.\nTrump has vowed to impose massive tariffs on allies and rivals, but the exact timing and impact of those tariffs remain unclear. For example, he said Monday he would impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1 but failed to sign an executive action directing those tariffs to go into effect.\nOn other nations, Trump said his administration might impose across-the-board tariffs but it wasn\u2019t ready to do that yet. How high will tariffs go and how long will they stay high? How will other countries respond? Some,like Canada, have vowed to retaliate with tariffs and other actions of their own.\nDuring his inaugural address, Trump promised to \u201cimmediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families\u201d and even reiterated plans to set up an External Revenue Service to collect tariff revenue. (Although Trump said foreign countries will get taxed,tariffs are paid by US importers, not foreign exporters. And they often pass the costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices.)\nTrump knows that the biggest frustration for many Americans is the level of prices. People are spending much more at the grocery store, on rent, car insurance and other items than before the pandemic.\nThe typical US household is spending about $1,213 more than in January 2021 for the same goods and services, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics.\nPaychecks, on average, are up by a bit more than that. Still, that means many people are just getting by with the higher cost of living, and many others are behind.\nTrump has said he will get prices to drop, butmany economists doubt that will broadly happen\u2013 unless the economy falls apart. While consumers love price drops, outright deflation can be dangerous and difficult to escape.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get prices back to pre-pandemic levels. The only way to do that is to get not a recession, but a depression,\u201d said Kelly. Trump acknowledged that recently, noting once prices rise,it\u2019s hard to get them back down again, but insisted he can make it happen.\nYet many mainstream economists have expressed concern that elements of the Trump agenda could be inflationary.\nBusinesses could pass along the cost of tariffs to consumers, as they have done in the past. And mass deportations could starve key construction, agriculture and other industries of workers.\nAs it is, there are concerns that the US economy is too hot \u2013 and that the Trump agenda could overheat it. The inflation rate has tumbled but remains above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target. Markets have shattered record high after record high, fueled by a rush into Big Tech and artificial intelligence stocks.\n\u201cThe bottom line is that the US economy is entering 2025 on a firm footing,\u201d Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, wrote in a Monday note titled \u201cThe US economy is in great shape.\u201d\n\u201cWe continue to worry more about upside risks to growth and inflation,\u201d Slok said.\nUltimately, Trump\u2019s economic success may not hinge on price drops. Instead, Trump should be rooting for a continuation of a streak that began under President Joe Biden: real wage growth.\nPaychecks have consistently been outpacing prices. If that trend continues under Trump, many more Americans will catch up to the higher level of prices and feel better about the cost of living.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/21\/business\/trump-economy-executive-order","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Larry Fink: \u2018The economy is weakening as we speak\u2019","date":"2025-03-12","body":"Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, said Wednesday that the Trump administration\u2019s barrage of policy changes is paralyzing American consumers and businesses \u2014 and that\u2019s already hurting the economy.\n\u201cThe collective impact in the short run is that people are pausing, they\u2019re pulling back,\u201d Fink told CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche in an exclusive interview. \u201cTalking to CEOs throughout the economy, I hear that the economy is weakening as we speak.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday forged ahead with his aggressive tariff agenda, imposing25% duties on all steel and aluminum imports\u2014 which was met with swift retaliation from the European Union and Canada. Meanwhile, his administration continues to overhaul the federal workforce, laying offnearly half of the staffat the US Department of Education on Tuesday.\nFink said the uncertainty sowed by the Trump administration\u2019s drastic changes is broad-based, unsettling companies and federal workers alike \u2014 and it remains to be seen whether that will worsen, he said.\n\u201cAll of these things have that ripple effect, and we will see over a long cycle whether this ripple effect gets worse or does it stabilize,\u201d he said.\nFink also told CNN his firm\u2019slandmark purchaseof two ports at either end of the Panama Canal was not political in nature and emphasizedon his belief that there isn\u2019t enough attention to what he describes as America\u2019s retirement \u201ccrisis.\u201d\nNevertheless, Fink said the Trump administration\u2019s policies \u201ccan be very productive for the United States\u201d in the long run. That includes thetariffs, he said.\n\u201cRight now the president is focusing on tariffs, but when he talks about reciprocal tariffs, actually, that may bring down tariffs over the long run,\u201d Fink said.\nLast month, Trump directed his administration to investigate the tariffs foreign countries impose on the United States and promised that he will match them, dollar for dollar. A global trade war, started by Trump, is already in full swing: In addition to Wednesday\u2019s metal tariffs, the Trump administration has already doubled the tariffs on China to 20%, on top of existing duties.\nIn addition to intense uncertainty, Wall Street has beenrattledby signs of a sputtering economy. Fink said it\u2019s possible that the US economy could stagnate, but he said it would likely be short lived.\n\u201cCould we have one quarter or two quarter of a flattening of our economy as we try to reset the economy? Absolutely,\u201d Fink said. \u201cBut I\u2019m looking beyond that. If we are able to unlock private capital\u2026 that will restart and rekindle the next wave of a bull market.\u201d\nHe also wasn\u2019t fazed bythe stock market\u2019s rout this week.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a market pullback,\u201d Fink said. \u201cI look at that as a buying opportunity because I\u2019m very bullish on America.\u201d\nFink also weighed in on his firm\u2019s takeover of two Panama Canal ports, a key waterway that facilitates hundreds of billions of dollars in trade annually, and the implications of Americans not saving enough for retirement.\n\u201cThe decision was purely economic, and we believe this is going to be great long term investment,\u201d Fink said. \u201cMy conversation with the president was positive, it was optimistic\u2026 but if it was four months earlier, I would have been calling the prior administration.\u201d\nSome of the canal operations being controlled by a Chinese firm had long angered Trump, and it was a topic he mentioned in his inaugural address in January, in which he said, \u201cWe\u2019re taking it back.\u201d\nBlackRock\u2019s deal with a consortium of fellow investorsaims to spend $22.8 billion to buy 43 ports around the world, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal from CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong company. They said the deal is an \u201cagreement in principle.\u201d\nIn a recent letter to investors, Fink said there isn\u2019t enough attention being paid to Americans not having enough savings for retirement, calling it a \u201ccrisis.\u201d\n\u201cI think some so much of this anxiety that we have in this country is all about the fear of retirement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see less mobility in America because people have to stay closer to their family because of inadequacy of savings.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/12\/economy\/larry-fink-blackrock-economy-weakening","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"As the US government hits pause, Trump\u2019s economic chaos only accelerates","date":"2025-10-02","body":"The economic warning lights are all going off.\nGiant tariffs are up in the air, once again. No official economic data will come out during the government shutdown. And once the business of the US government does resume, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who the president will tap to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics now that the administration has been forced to claw back its disastrous first pick.\nLet\u2019s step back on the off-chance that the reliability of government statisticswasn\u2019tyour top priority this week\u2026\nIn normal times, when the US government is functioning, we the people are entitled to a steady stream of reports that allow us to take the temperature of the US economy. In these not-normal times, when the federal government has shut down, that data stream dries up because the agencies that produce them can\u2019t staff their operations without funding from Congress.\nThat means the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which should have landed this Friday, won\u2019t arrive until the shutdown ends. Ditto two key inflation reports due in the coming weeks.\nWithout those reports, investors, policymakers and business leaders \u2014 already navigating the uncertainty of Trump\u2019s on-again-off-again tariffs, his attempted takeover of the Federal Reserve,sporadic bailoutsof select foreign nations and randomsocial media outbursts\u2014 are flying blind.\nThe longer the shutdown lasts, the more indicators may be delayed, and the more uncertainty takes over. Without a full staff, the BLS can\u2019t collect employment data, which means the September and October reports could both be delayed.\n\u201cThe shutdown adds to the significant policy uncertainty and volatility that we\u2019ve seen this year from tariffs, court cases, government staff reductions, and threats to the independence of statistical agencies and the Fed,\u201d Brett House, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in an email Wednesday. \u201cAll of this could, at the margin, create a chilling effect on hiring and investment amongst private-sector companies that could dent growth.\u201d\nThe shutdown is just the latest debacle for the BLS, an agency that has been chronically understaffed and underfunded for years.\nTwo months ago, Trump fired the head of the agency, Erika McEntarfer, claiming, with zero evidence, that she\u2019d somehow rigged the numbers that made his economy look bad.\n(In reality, Trump\u2019s tariffs appear to be the biggest culprit behind the weakening of the US economy, particularly when it comes to small and medium-size businesses that lack the financial flexibility that giant corporations have to absorb the added costs. Shooting the messengerdoesn\u2019t change the data, it turns out.)\nTo replace McEntarfer, Trump nominated a loyalist,Heritage Foundation economist EJ Antoni.\nBut the White House on Tuesday abruptly withdrew Antoni\u2019s name from consideration, as it looked increasingly like his confirmation would be a losing battle.\nIn addition to Antoni\u2019s lack of experience, which concerned conservative and liberal economists alike, and his \u201cbystander\u201d status at the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol,CNN\u2019s KFile teamunearthed an old Twitter account of his that was, well, pretty gross. (The account included sexually degrading comments about Kamala Harris, anti-gay remarks, a smorgasbord of conspiracy theories and all manner of crude insults aimed at critics of Trump.)\nA White House official didn\u2019t directly address the reason for yanking his nomination, saying Antoni \u201cis a brilliant economist and an American patriot that will continue to do good work on behalf of our great country.\u201d The official added that Trump would announce a new BLS nominee soon.\nWhich brings us back to the uncertainty issue.\nIt almost doesn\u2019t matter whom Trump nominates to oversee the BLS next. By firing McEntarfer, even on his baseless claim of corruption, he\u2019s sowed doubt in independent agencies\u2019 reliability (see also: the Fed) at the worst possible time for the economy.\nInflation is creeping higher as hiring slows \u2014 a sign that the dreaded\u201cstagflation,\u201dthe economic equivalent of black mold in your basement, may be taking root. If Fed officials can\u2019t see it coming, there\u2019s little they (or anyone) can do to prevent it.\n\u201cThis shutdown is not just a temporary inconvenience for American people,\u201d said Mohammad Elahee, professor of international business at Quinnipiac University, in an email. \u201cIt represents a systemic shock \u2026 with the potential to push the US economy toward recession in 2026.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/02\/business\/economy-data-jobs-chaos","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Consumer confidence has plunged. A key GDP forecast suddenly turned negative. Andextreme fear is back on Wall Street, with stocks sliding last month.\nDespite the murky picture, President Donald Trump continues to inject chaos into the economy with almost-constant tariff threats.\nNow he\u2019s just hours away from lobbing tariffs on not just one or two butall three of America\u2019s biggest trading partners.\nStarting on Tuesday, Trump has vowed to impose a 25% tariff on imported goods from Mexico and Canada, and to double tariffs on those from China to 20%. However, what ends up going into effect could significantly change down to the wire. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown and Wolf Blitzer on Monday he expects the president to make a final decision \u201cthis afternoon.\u201d\nThose tariffs \u2014 if they get imposed \u2014 could increase costs for Americans at a time when inflation remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target. That, in turn, could prevent the Fed from lowering borrowing costs, another source of pain in the cost-of-living problem confronting consumers.\nMexico and Canada have all vowed to retaliate by slapping their own tariffs on US goods, setting the stage for a potential trade war inside of North America. China haspromised to respond to higher tariffs, too.\nEven just the threat of tariffs has a cost, causing confusion and uncertainty that makes it hard for investors, CEOs and consumers to plan.\nOne measure of this confusion, thetrade policy uncertainty index, spiked in January to the highest level in data going back to 1960. And that doesn\u2019t even factor in the latest tariff threats from the White House in recent days.\nA US-based transportation equipment supplier responded to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s February survey, saying that \u201ccustomers are pausing on new orders as a result of uncertainty regarding tariffs. There is no clear direction from the administration on how they will be implemented, so it\u2019s harder to project how they will affect business.\u201d\nJay Foreman, the CEO of Basic Fun!, a toy company that makes Care Bears and Tonka trucks, among other goods, said his business was just starting to contend with the 10% tariffs Trump imposed across all Chinese imports that went into effect last month.\nRelated articleAmericans are getting fed up with the economy. Does that mean we\u2019re heading into a recession?\nNow the threat of an additional 10% tariff is potentially leaving his company with \u201canother $5 million gap\u201d in its finances.\nThat\u2019s because around 90% of all the toys Basic Fun! sells are manufactured in China. Until around 2026, the company is being forced to fully absorb the added cost of tariffs because of contracts that have already been signed with customers, Foreman told CNN.\n\u201cEvery plan we have to mitigate a 10% tariff is not workable based on a 20% tariff,\u201d he said.\nIn Trump\u2019s ideal world, the threat of higher tariffs would cause Foreman to move production to the US. But that\u2019s simply not a financially viable option.\n\u201cThere are things you aren\u2019t able to physically produce here, and toys is one of those.\u201d China, he said, has been an unmatched location for toy production due to the manufacturing labor force, cost advantages and production capacity.\nBut even if it were possible to move production to the US, he said it\u2019s all but guaranteed he\u2019d have to charge higher prices. \u201cA $10 baby doll will go to $30. Is that what the consumer wants?\u201d\nThough a much larger company, Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright said the national fast-food chain intends to absorb extra costs from tariffs this year and hold prices at current levels.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the tariffs are transitory, if they\u2019re going to be permanent, how sticky they\u2019ll be in the new administration,\u201d Boatwright said in an interview with NBC News that aired Sunday night, explaining why he would like to hold off on raising prices. However, he didn\u2019t rule it out entirely, saying that Chipotle may have to pass on higher costs to customers if tariffs present \u201csignificant headwind.\u201d\nStill it\u2019s hardly just companies relying on Chinese goods that are concerned about tariffs. Even the CEO of one of the largest US aluminum makers, Alcoa, warned the 25% tariffs Trump threatened across all aluminum importscould cost the United States 100,000 jobs.\nUnderscoring the growth scare gripping investors, a closely watched projection of economic growth was sharply downgraded on Friday.\nTheAtlanta Federal Reserve\u2019s GDPNow modelnow projects a 2.8% decline in GDP for the first quarter. While it\u2019s far too early to say whether GDP will turn negative, it marks a swift downgrade from a growth forecast of 2.3% previously.\nThe forecast initially turned negative, to -1.5%, on Friday after factoring in thedive in consumer spendingthat was reported in January\u2019s Personal Consumption Expenditures report released that day. Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the US economy, so pullbacks in spending can have an outsized impact on GDP.\nThen on Monday it sank further into negative territory following new data releases indicating declines in construction spending as well as a key index capturing manufacturing activity.\nIn addition, uncertainty around tariffs could be weighing on the mood of American consumers, with recent consumer confidence metrics deteriorating at a historic pace.\nRelated articleInflation is easing, but another alarm bell is ringing about the US economy\nPantheon Macroeconomics noted that the 11-point drop in the Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index between December and February is the biggest to start a year since 2009 \u2014 during the height of the Great Recession.\nWorse, the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index\u2019s 9-point drop over that span is the most since records began in 1978.\nOf course, it\u2019s far too early to know whether the softening outlook for the economy economic picture is just a blip or something more concerning.\nTime and again the US economy has shaken off recession fears, including in 2022 after the Fed spiked interest rates to fight inflation, and in the summer of 2024 when the unemployment rate started to rise.\nEd Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, is confident the growth scare is just a headfake caused by extremely cold weather in January and uncertainty around policies in Washington.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a soft patch.

{"title":"Skyrocketing ACA premiums force enrollees to make tough decisions","date":"2025-11-09","body":"In late October, Elizabeth Wick got the email she had been dreading. Her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, told her that the monthly premiums for her Affordable Care Act policywould soarto $1,380 next year, up from $862.\nWick, 57, currently gets $400 infederal premium subsidies, which makes the monthly cost of her health insurance more manageable. But the Arlington, Texas, resident is not counting on that assistance for next year since she also received a letter from the federal Obamacare exchange saying she likely won\u2019t be eligible for any help in 2026 if the enhanced subsidies expire as scheduled at year\u2019s end.\nTherising health insurance ratesand lapsing subsidies could upend Wick\u2019s life. A therapist who focuses on sexual assault survivors, she launched a full-time private practice earlier this year but depends on Obamacare coverage since she has preexisting medical conditions. However, having to pay three times her current tab is unaffordable and could force her to give up her practice and find a job that offers health benefits.\n\u201cHealth insurance will determine what my life will look like, whether or not I can continue with my private practice,\u201d said Wick, who ruminates over the situation before she goes to sleep and when she\u2019s out for her daily walks.\nObamacare enrollees: Worried about losing the enhanced subsidies? Share your story\nWick is among the millions of Americans with Affordable Care Act policies who must contend with the looming lapse of the enhanced subsidies. The increased cost of coverage can lead to agonizing trade-offs for many enrollees, including cutting back on other necessities, trying to avoid getting care or forgoing health insurance entirely.\nThe issue wasat the centerof the stalemate on Capitol Hill which led to a record federal government shutdown. Democrats said they would only support a federal funding package for fiscal year 2026 if it also extended the more generous assistance, but Republicans said they would only negotiate after the government reopens. In the end, a group of Democrats flipped and agreed to vote to reopen the government in exchange for a future vote on extending theenhanced subsidies.\nThe enhanced subsidies have enabled many lower-income Americans to obtain coverage with no or very low monthly premiums and broadened eligibility for assistance to many middle-class consumers. Obamacare\u2019s original subsidies, which are part of the 2010 health reform law and are not expiring, are only available to those who earn less than four times the federal poverty level, or about $63,000 for an individual and $129,000 for a family of four.\nEnacted by a Democratic-led Congress during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, the extra assistance helped spur a record 24 million people to sign up for Obamacare policies this year, with many new enrollees hailing from states that voted for President Donald Trump in 2024. More than 90% of policyholders receive subsidies.\nThe expiring beefed-up subsidies, along with rising health care costs, contributed to insurers hiking rates by 26%, on average, for next year, according to federal data.\nBut what enrollees will actually pay will be far higher because they won\u2019t have the additional aid. Premium payments will more than double, on average, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.\nCertain policyholders will be hit harder than others. Those with incomes just above the poverty level will go from paying $0 or nearly $0 in premiums to being on the hook for a few hundred dollars a year, said Cynthia Cox, KFF\u2019s director of the Program on the ACA. Nearly half of enrollees are in this group.\n\u201cFor them, it\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d Cox said. \u201cIt may be a big enough increase that they feel they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\nAlso, enrollees in their 50s and early 60s, who already pay a lot for coverage, will have to shell out even more. An older couple making $85,000 a year could see their premiums skyrocket by more than $20,000 a year, she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that many of them will be able to afford to continue that coverage,\u201d Cox said.\nThat\u2019s the situation that Sunni Montgomery finds herself in.\nAt 63, Montgomery is facing a relentless battle with lung cancer. Since 2022, she\u2019s undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, relying on her ACA marketplace plan to cover the mounting costs. Thanks to enhanced subsidies, her premium this year was $541 a month \u2014 just manageable with Social Security Disability and a part-time job.\nBut next year, without those subsidies, she says her premium is set to soar to $1,758 a month \u2014 far outside her budget.\n\u201cI have to face the reality that I am probably going to become a late-stage cancer patient who\u2019s uninsured,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cI have fought this so hard. I want to live.\u201d\nNow on daily oxygen and getting scans every three months, she says she\u2019s at high risk for recurrence. Without insurance, those lifesaving treatments will be out of reach.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not getting scans and we don\u2019t know if something\u2019s recurred, then what that can mean is the end of me,\u201d said Montgomery, who is racing to squeeze in every scan and checkup she can before her coverage expires.\nSimilarly, Chris and Donna Vetter have made the agonizing decision to drop their health insurance, saying they simply cannot afford it.\nChris, 62, is a retired federal worker, and Donna, 60, runs a small medical billing business. They relied on their ACA plan \u2014 reduced to $401 a month by the enhanced subsidies \u2014 to manage Donna\u2019s asthma and Chris\u2019 atrial fibrillation. But next year, their premium is set to skyrocket to $1,975 a month \u2014 nearly half their income.\nThey pored over options on the ACA marketplace but say even the cheapest plans hovered near $1,000 a month. Yet those policies \u201chave huge deductibles, big copays, and they don\u2019t cover a lot, so effectively it\u2019s like not having insurance anyways,\u201d Chris said.\nNow, the Vetters, who live in rural Somerset County, Maryland, are bracing for a future without coverage \u2014 expecting to cancel appointments, forgo screenings, skip medications, and cross their fingers that disaster doesn\u2019t strike.\n\u201cI\u2019m just scared, and I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Donna said. \u201cIf anything should go wrong \u2014 God forbid a car accident, heart attack, cancer \u2014 we\u2019ll have nothing.\u201d\nSoaring premiums have also left Alison and her husband, Chris, who live in Carson City, Nevada, debating over what to do about their Obamacare coverage. They began buying policies on the exchange three years ago, when Chris, a former police officer, had to retire after a serious injury.\nThis year, they are paying only $183 a month after nearly $1,350 in subsidies. But next year, their policy will cost $936 after some subsidies. They are contemplating buying a less expensive plan with a much higher deductible, though that will force them to think twice about going to urgent care or the emergency room.\n\u201cJust to even be in a situation where you have to think about, well, do I really need it? Do I really need that medication? Do I really need to go to the urgent care? God forbid, do I really need to go to the ER or can I, for lack of a better word, suck it up?\u201d said Alison, who asked that only her first name be used because of her husband\u2019s former profession. \u201cI mean those are all decisions that we\u2019re going to be forced to have to make.\u201d\nYounger Americans are also grappling with the increased costs.\nKris McKegney, 23, now pays $300 a month after subsidies for a higher-end plan with only a $3,000 annual deductible. Keeping the same plan would cost him $1,250 a month because he doesn\u2019t expect to qualify for any assistance. That amount is out of the question, said the self-employed accountant.\nOne option he\u2019s considering is signing up for a $400-a-month catastrophic plan, which would require him to pay for all his medications, doctor visits and therapy appointments. Another is enrolling in a policy with an $850 monthly premium and a $10,000 deductible that would provide more coverage. But the latter would entail dipping into his retirement fund, pausing his efforts to save for a down payment on a house and raising rates on his clients, which are mostly nonprofit organizations.\nA Vermont resident, McKegney said health care is important to him because he is transgender. The battle on Capitol Hill over the enhanced subsidies, also known as advanced premium tax credits, makes him feel \u201cdegraded.\u201d\n\u201cThe tax credits have helped millions of people access health care, and it seems very cruel to then take that away,\u201d he said.\nThe enhanced subsidies\u2019 looming expiration led Nolan LeRoux and Emily Clute to contemplate drastic measures to retain at least some assistance. The couple, both 35, were set to get married in November but considered not filing their license after the ceremony. That\u2019s because they are more likely to qualify for Obamacare\u2019s original subsidies as individuals than as a married couple \u2014 the income threshold for a couple is less than double that of a single person.\nOtherwise, the Bethlehem, New York, residents are looking at paying more than $1,360 per month next year for coverage, nearly double the total of what they\u2019d pay as individuals for the same plan with some assistance. If the enhanced subsidies are extended, they would be eligible for more aid, even as a married couple.\nSince they aren\u2019t comfortable going without insurance, the couple may end up working more to help cover the cost. He is a barber, and she is a tattoo artist. But they aren\u2019t happy about having to spend more time apart as newlyweds to pay for higher premiums. What\u2019s more, the higher tab would also weigh on their honeymoon plans, dampening any thought of going to California.\nUltimately, though, the stress of not having health insurance would be greater than the concern of how to pay for it since anything could happen, like being hit by a drunk driver, LeRoux said.\n\u201cThere are not many things health care-wise that are particularly affordable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019d be a lot of stress because I don\u2019t know exactly how we would pay for a medical bill that was in the five figures.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/09\/politics\/aca-enrollment-premiums-increase-impact","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Two federal judges require Trump administration to use emergency funds to partially cover food stamp benefits","date":"2025-10-31","body":"Two federal judges said Friday that the Trump administration must tap into billions of dollars in emergency funds to at least partially coverfood stamp benefitsfor tens of millions of Americans in November.\nThe rulings from judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island reject a controversial US Department of Agriculture claim that it could not use a contingency fund, which the agency says has $5.3 billion remaining in it, to help cover the benefits amid the month-long government shutdown.\nHours later, President Donald Trump said he has instructed the administration\u2019s lawyers to ask the courts how it can legally fund the benefits as quickly as possible because the attorneys \u201cdo not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available.\u201d\n\u201cEven if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,\u201d Trumppostedon Truth Social Friday evening. \u201cIf we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.\u201d\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, costs between $8 billion and $9 billion a month, so the judges\u2019 orders will not cover all of the needed payments for November.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the \u2026 contingency funds are appropriated funds that are without a doubt necessary to carry out the program\u2019s operation.\u201d US District Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island said. \u201cThe shutdown of the government through funding doesn\u2019t do away with SNAP, it just does away with the funding of it.\u201d\nDuring proceedings Friday, McConnell said he was ordering the government to use the contingency fund to ensure at least some benefits could be distributed.\n\u201cThere is no doubt, and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur, if it hasn\u2019t already occurred, in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,\u201d he said.\nIn a written ruling released Saturday, McConnell wrote that the administration must make a partial payment to SNAP beneficiaries using the contingency funds by Wednesday.\nBut he wrote the USDA should, within its discretion, find additional funds to provide full benefits to recipients. If the agency chooses this option, it must make the full payment by the end of Monday, as making the full payment is simpler than calculating partial payments.\nIn his ruling, McConnell also responded directly to Trump\u2019s comments Friday, writing, \u201cthe Court greatly appreciates the President\u2019s quick and definitive response to this Court\u2019s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.\u201d\nMcConnell\u2019s ruling during a hastily scheduled hearing came minutes after US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston made a similar order. Both judges, appointees of President Barack Obama, also said that USDA is allowed to tap into another bucket of money of nearly $17 billion to pay November SNAP benefits in full, but that decision is currently up to the administration.\nThough Talwani stopped short on Friday of requiring the administration to tap into the contingency fund, she said the USDA was required to use money in that rainy-day fund to partially cover November benefits and gave it until Monday to decide whether it would use only those funds or also dip into a separate pot of money.\n\u201cThis court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program. And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds \u2026 to avoid any reductions,\u201dTalwani said in a 15-page order.\nDo you rely on SNAP benefits? Tell us what potentially losing them means for your family\nThe Trump administration opposes tapping into those other funds, arguing in court it will hurt the child nutrition programs that the revenue supports.\nEven with Trump\u2019s directive and the judge\u2019s rulings, millions of recipients will still face delays in getting their benefits, which were scheduled to start being distributed on November 1. It will take time for the Department of Agriculture and states to get the money flowing again.\nIn the program\u2019s decades-long history, a government shutdown has never prevented it from distributing SNAP funds to states, which administer the benefits, though the program was at risk during the 2018-2019 impasse.\nThe Boston lawsuit was filed earlier this week by a group of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the case in Rhode Island was brought Thursday by a coalition of cities, non-profits, unions and small businesses.\nAs the government shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts are increasingly being asked to intervene to stave off a series of dramatic developments. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California indefinitely blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, saying the government was unlawfully using the shutdown as legal justification for the layoffs.\nThe administration could seek appeals. Asked earlier Friday by CNN what the department would do if courts required USDA to tap into the contingency fund, Secretary Brooke Rollins said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all the options.\u201d\nStates stopped the process of issuing benefits for November after the USDA sent them a letter on October 10 ordering them to do so. States send SNAP enrollees\u2019 information to vendors every month so they can load funds onto recipients\u2019 benefit cards.\nEach state has a specific date by which they must send the information ahead of the new month in order for benefits to go out on time, according to the lawsuit. Payments are made on a staggered basis throughout the month.\nTalwani acknowledged the likely delay in benefits during a hearing Thursday, and also asked about the process of providing partial payments to recipients next month since the contingency fund alone won\u2019t cover the full amount.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the reality that \u2026 the benefits aren\u2019t going to be there on November 1,\u201d she said.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/31\/politics\/snap-federal-judges","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"How to make $3.8 trillion disappear in the federal budget","date":"2025-04-07","body":"A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nMost Americans might be rightly focused on President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and the tariff drama that has devalued retirement accounts and nest eggs and has Americans sweating higher prices.\nBut then something notable happened in the wee hours of Saturday morning when Senate Republicans advanced a budget blueprint that could make $3.8 trillion disappear.\nMath is notoriously fuzzy in Washington, DC.\nFor instance, the White House has made some conflicting arguments about reciprocal tariffs, simultaneously arguing they could raise $6 trillion over 10 years and that tariffs are a negotiating tactic to force concessions from other countries.\nIf the threat of tariffs leads to new trade deals, they won\u2019t bring in trillions of new revenue to offset income tax cuts. Appearing at the White House Monday, Trump said countries are ready to negotiate and he threatened to add another 50% tariff to China after the communist country said it would match the 34% tariff Trump announced against China last week.\nThe trade war is part of the \u201cmedicine\u201d Trump says is necessary to force companies to bring manufacturing back to the US.\nBut tariffs are only one leg of Trump\u2019s economic plan. Trump also needs to extend tax cuts enacted during his first term and he also wants to add in some new ones.\nFor that, he\u2019ll need Republicans on Capitol Hill to pass a law to make the tax cuts happen.\nWhich brings us to Saturday morning, when senators sent the House their version of a budget plan on a 51-48 vote. It envisions $1.5 trillion in spending cuts \u2013 smaller than the more than $4 trillion in a House version.\nRelated: Senate GOP adopts budget blueprint to advance Trump agenda as spending fight consumes Capitol Hill\nBut Senate Republicans got creative with their budgeting and broke with a 40-year precedent. Instead of counting the $3.8 trillion it will cost to extend Trump\u2019s first-term tax cuts, they sidestepped the Senate parliamentarian.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, exerted power as the Budget Committee chairman and simplyreinterpreted budget rules.He set the baseline for the budget at \u201ccurrent policy,\u201d with the tax cuts, instead of current law, which assumes the tax cuts expire. By doing so, Graham erased trillions from the ledger for the purposes of moving the measure.\nThose individual tax cuts were originally passed on a temporary basis in so that they could be enacted through the budget process. Now Republicans are trying to make them permanent by tweaking the way the budget is calculated.\nThis changing of the budget rules, along with spending cuts, is meant to free up room in the budget, both to extend expiring tax cuts and make room for new ones Trump promised during the presidential campaign, like ending taxes on income earned from tips and social security benefits.\nIf prices rise as a result of tariffs, as most economists predict, Trump will want to point to tax cuts as offsetting that inflation.\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee described the redrawn budget baseline as \u201cgaslighting from Republicans about the true cost of their tax plan.\u201d But because budget bills are exempt from the normal 60-votes needed to break a filibuster, there\u2019s little Democrats can do.\nThere are still many steps to go. House Republicans do not particularly like the Senate\u2019s blueprint but both chambers must pass the same thing in order to begin the budget reconciliation process and drafting legislation for Trump\u2019s agenda.\nSome Republicans grumbled about the budget plan and the new accounting trick before voting for it.\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said changing the budget rules would set a\u201cdangerous\u201d precedent.\n\u201cTo be a conservative is to know that sometimes you don\u2019t open Pandora\u2019s box, even if you can,\u201d Cassidy said on the Senate floor before voting for the bill.\nIn addition to wiping away that $3.8 trillion, senators also want to raise the debt limit by $5 trillion.\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of two Republicans to vote against the Senate budget resolution, said Republicans were trying to have it both ways by cutting programs through the Department of Government Efficiency, but then authorizing $5 trillion in new debt.\n\u201cWhat worries me is that so many things in Washington are smoke and mirrors,\u201d Paul said on the Senate floor. \u201cOn the one hand it appears as if all this great savings is happening. But on the other hand the resolution will increase the debt by $5 trillion. So which is it? Are we cutting spending or are we expanding the debt?\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/07\/politics\/republicans-federal-budget-analysis","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Republicans tweak the social contract to ask more of states","date":"2025-05-20","body":"Editor\u2019s Note:A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nAn emerging reality of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term is that the federal government will be doing less and states will need to do a lot more on everything from disaster relief to health insurance.\nThe White House and Republicans in Congress are effectively trying to shift financial responsibility on multiple fronts away from Washington, DC, in what could amount to a rewriting of the American social contract.\nIn the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d which House Republicans are tweaking before a likely vote this week, individual tax cuts from Trump\u2019s first term are made permanent and paid for by adding trillions to the national debt, according to estimates, and requiring states to spend more on the safety net of welfare programs that feed and provide health insurance to the poorest Americans.\nTrump traveled to Capitol Hillon Tuesday to pressure wavering House Republicans to support the bill. Even if GOP representatives can pass their House bill, they will need to work with senators on a version that can clear both chambers, meaning that much of what\u2019s below could change. CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby has amuch more detailed lookat the House Republicans\u2019 bill.\nStates, for the first time, would have to pay for a portion of food stamp benefits, which are now called theSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,or SNAP.\nStates and the federal government have long shared the cost of administering the program, but under the GOP proposal, states would go from paying nothing for SNAP benefits to being required to pay between 5% and 25%, as well as a larger portion of administrative costs.\nA state whose residents had gotten $1 billion in benefits would have to find close to $100 million to maintain those current benefits if it suddenly needed to match 10%.\nBut if the state did not provide the full $100 million, according to an assessment by the left-leaningCenter on Budget and Policy Prioritiesof the 2018 proposal on which this part of the current bill is based, the federal matching funds might also drop since the federal government would be prohibited from paying part of the state\u2019s percentage. A state that paid $75 million instead of $100 million could actually see its SNAP benefits drop by $250 million.\nChanges like this would likely result in a reduction in the number of people \u2013 currently more than 40 million, or close to 13% of the US population \u2013 who are able to get SNAP.\nGenerally, people are only eligible for food assistance if they makeless than $33,576per year for a family of three. Enrollment in the program, and its cost, spiked during the pandemic.\nIn exchange for the cuts, the federal government couldsave nearly $300 billion over 10 years. Supporters argue that making states pay more for the program will incentivize states to control costs.\nMedicaid is the program by which states and the federal government split the cost of providing health insurance to about 71 million Americans who live at or just above the federal poverty level.\nRepublicans are still haggling over the specifics of their plan, and some lawmakers in the Senate have said they would oppose any cuts.\nOn Capitol Hill, after giving Republicans a \u201cpep talk\u201d behind closed doors, Trump talked to reporters and denied any of these cost savings are cuts.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not touching anything. All I want is one thing. Three words. We don\u2019t want any waste, fraud, or abuse,\u201d Trump said.\nOne major expected change is that for the first time there will be work requirements for Medicaid. There is some question over whether those requirements would kick in starting in 2027 or 2029 as Republicans work to finalize the bill.\nRegardless, the bill achieves cost savings by assuming fewer Americans would have health insurance. A preliminary assessment of an early version of the bill by the Congressional Budget Office suggests Medicaid would cover millions fewer people by 2034. That figure would rise if work requirements are imposed in 2027.\nMedicaid spending has eaten up an increasingly large portion of state budgets, rising from about 22% in 2010 when the Affordable Care Act was passed to nearly30% in 2024,a figure that includes federal matching funds. Without the federal funds, states spend 19% of their budgets on Medicaid.\nThe Affordable Care Act expanded coverage to people making up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2013 $35,997.50 for a family of three in 2025 \u2013 and the federal government footed most of the bill. Forty states and Washington, DC, have now expanded coverage.\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat, told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown last week that states would not be able to backfill cuts in Medicaid spending.\n\u201cThe state can\u2019t supplant the federal dollars. That\u2019s the problem here,\u201d Whitmer said, predicting \u201cpain in all 50 states, to Americans all across this country, if Congress goes forward with this.\u201d\nThe federal government uses a complicated formula to determine how much of a state\u2019s Medicaid costs it will cover, and it picks up a larger percentage in states with lower average incomes. Proposals by fiscal hawks to change that formula and lower the federal government\u2019s contribution have so far been rejected.\nThe entire Medicaid program cost more than $880 billion in 2023 and the federal government paid more than $606 billion of that,according to KFF.\nThe current House proposal would also reduce federal funding to the 14 states that have used their own state funds to cover undocumented children.\nA handful of states, notably California, have experimented with opening their Medicaid system even to some undocumented adults, but paying for that coverage entirely with state funds.\nIt has been an expensive effort. California Gov. Gavin Newsom indicated he will dial back on that program as he faces a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall paired with the threat of losing federal money for Medicaid. The state released an analysis of an early version of Republicans\u2019 bill that projected3.4 million Californianswould lose coverage.\nCalifornia separately provides some subsistence aid to undocumented people who don\u2019t qualify for federal SSI benefits, but the Trump administration has threatened that program bylaunching a federal investigation.\nThe effort to shift burdens away from the federal government extends well beyond the tax bill.\nTrump\u2019s administration has begun denying disaster relief to states and the administration is working to shrink FEMA\u2019s imprint, CNN has reported, which in the short term means the disaster relief agency is \u201cnot ready for hurricane season,\u201d according to an internal memo.\nThe longer-term effect of the changes would put more of a focus on state governments. That follows aMarch executive orderin which the president called for states to be \u201cempowered\u201d to do more to prepare for \u201ccyber attacks, wildfires, hurricanes, and space weather.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s plan for the Department of Education has been sold as a way to give states more power over education, but it would also significantly cut the amount of federal dollars going to schools.His budget proposalcuts $12 billion from the department.\nAt the same time, the administration has used federal dollars to pressure states to end diversity programs and guarantee that the undocumented are not accessing taxpayer-funded benefits.\nLuhby noted that the tax and policy bill on Capitol Hill would also reduce federal spending on student loans by $350 billion. It would pare back on federally subsidized loans and cap the amount of federal aid a student can receive at the \u201cmedian cost of college.\u201d It would also end economic hardship and unemployment deferments.\nThat\u2019s not directly asking states to do more, but it will have a knock-on effect in states if fewer Americans can afford to go to college.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/20\/politics\/tax-bill-medicaid-snap-fema-college-funding","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Federal budget deficit expected to soar to $2.7 trillion in 2035, highlighting pressure on GOP","date":"2025-01-17","body":"Ascongressional Republicans struggleto keep deficits in check while extending their sweeping 2017 tax cuts, the Congressional Budget Office provided a dour forecast.\nEven if thosetax breaksare allowed to lapse at year\u2019s end, the federal budget deficit will still climb to $2.7 trillion in a decade, according to the CBO\u2019s latest outlook, released Friday. That projection takes into account a boost in individual income tax revenue starting in 2026, though the impact will be \u201crelatively modest,\u201d CBO Director Phillip Swagel told reporters Friday.\nSpending on Social Security, Medicare and interest payments, however, will grow faster than revenues, further widening the deficit. Fueled by rising debt levels, interest costs are expected to surpass defense spending for the next decade.\nIn 2035, the adjusted deficit will equal 6.1% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, or GDP, far higher than the 3.8% average of the past 50 years. The deficits are notably large considering the forecasts for relatively low unemployment rates in coming years, Swagel noted.\nMeanwhile, in 2029, the federal debt is expected to surpass its record high of 106% of GDP in 1946. It\u2019s projected to be 100% of GDP this year and hit 118% in 2035.\nThe projections reinforce thedifficult taskthat lies ahead for President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans, who took full control of Capitol Hill this year with a big agenda in mind. Among their top priorities is extending the expiring Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions, which would add an estimated $4.6 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.\nA more immediate hurdle for lawmakers is approving agovernment spending planfor the current fiscal year, which will likely require bipartisan agreement. Funding currently runs out in mid-March, threatening a government shutdown.\nFiscal conservatives are advocating for spending cuts, which Democrats have sought to blunt. Discretionary spending, which includes defense, certain veterans\u2019 benefits, transportation, education and other items, as a share of the economy is relatively low compared to its historical average, Swagel said.\nFor the current fiscal year, the deficit will rise to $1.9 trillion, or 6.2% of GDP, as the federal government continues to spend more than it collects in revenue. Trump\u2019s Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent wants toslash the budget deficitto 3% of GDP by 2028.\nWhat\u2019s more, in coming months, Congress must address thedebt ceiling, which the US is on the verge of hitting, or risk the US defaulting on its obligations. But it could be a tough sell among some Republican lawmakers.\nCBO\u2019s budget outlooks are critical for Congress because they establish baselines for spending, revenue and deficits under current law. These baselines are used to evaluate the cost of future policy measures.\nHowever, some GOP lawmakers are floating the idea of evaluating the cost of extending the expiring tax provisions as though they were going to continue, a method known as \u201ccurrent policy.\u201d This would make it look as though extending the measures has no cost, rather than adding trillions of dollars to the deficit over a decade under current law, in which the tax cuts lapse at the end of 2025.\n\u201cCBO\u2019s new report shows the high budgetary stakes as a new Congress and president begin their terms and face critically important budget decisions this year,\u201d said Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a watchdog group. \u201cTo meet this moment, it is essential that America demonstrates this basic fiscal competence: that we can keep our government open, avoid self-inflicted economic crises and begin to address our $36 trillion and growing national debt.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/17\/politics\/us-debt-federal-budget-deficit","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

That\u2019s significantly higher than the 3.3% rate reported in the second estimate, and well above the 3% initially reported.\nGDP was revised higher largely due to new additional dataon consumer spending.Personal consumption expenditures rose at an annualized pace of 2.5% in the second quarter, according to the third estimate, up sharply from the second estimate\u2019s 1.6%.\nThe big difference between the first estimate and the third one is \u201ccertainly notable and outside the norm,\u201d Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at investing platform eToro, told CNN.\n\u201cThis year\u2019s economic data \u2014 especially over the past few months \u2014 has been noisy, and economic policy uncertainty has remained elevated throughout 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cWith so many moving parts in the GDP report, it\u2019s not surprising that larger-than-expected revisions are showing up, particularly in a year marked by heightened volatility and mixed signals.\u201d\nBut the economic story of the second quarter remains the same: Falling imports and US consumers who kept on spending helped fuel the rebound during the spring, following a contraction in the beginning of the year when importers stocked up on inventories to get ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, which subtracted from GDP.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates that GDP continued to power through at a robust pace in the third quarter, forecasting third-quarter GDP to register at a solid 3.3% rate.\nThe government\u2019s first estimate of third-quarter GDP is scheduled to be released next month.\n\u201cThursday\u2019s upward GDP revision for the second quarter confirmed that the economy grew at a healthy clip, even as tariff uncertainty reached fever pitch during the quarter,\u201d Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management, wrote in an analyst note Thursday.\n\u201cThe US economy is resilient and the strong GDP is another indication that we are not at risk of any kind of recession, even with slowing labor market growth,\u201d he said.\nThe US labor marketis slowingand consumer sentimentis declining againbut, so far, Americans haven\u2019t cut back on their spending.\nThat\u2019s key because consumer spending is the lifeblood of the US economy, accounting for about two-thirds of economic output.\nAgainst the odds, retail sales, which comprise a sizable chunk of overall spending, rose 0.6% in August from the prior month, according to Commerce Department data, following July\u2019s 0.6% gain.\nThe government on Friday releases more comprehensive figures on consumer spending in August, which includes purchases of services, as part of its monthly Personal Consumption Expenditures report.\nStill, an increasingly fragile labor market poses a risk to America\u2019s economic engine, especially if layoffs start to climb.\nNew applications for unemployment benefits remained relatively low last week, the Labor Department said in a separate report released Thursday, but filings by federal workers who\u2019ve been laid off have crept up in recent weeks, and could continue to climb.\nIn a separate report from the Commerce Department released Thursday, new orders for durable goods rebounded by a strong 2.9% in August, following two consecutive monthly declines, boosted by new orders for aircrafts and parts.\nHowever, excluding transportation equipment, new orders for durable goods were up a more modest 0.4% last month.\nNew orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft \u2014 a key gauge of business investment \u2014 rose 0.6% in August, down slightly from July\u2019s 0.8% gain.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/25\/economy\/us-gdp-q2-final","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

{"title":"Trump megabill and economic agenda would spur growth and reduce national debt, according to White House report","date":"2025-06-25","body":"President Donald Trump\u2019s megabill and his overall economic agenda would increase economic growth, spur job creation, boost wages and lower the national debt, according to anupdated reportreleased Wednesday by the White House Council of Economic Advisers.\nThe analysis includes measures beyond just the tax provisions in the \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill,\u201d which theSenate hopes to vote onthis week. It takes into account the president\u2019s deregulatory and energy agendas, tariff revenue, cuts in discretionary spending included inTrump\u2019s budget blueprintand interest savings from lower debt. It does not factor inhistoric cutsto the nation\u2019s safety net programs, includingMedicaidandfood stamps.\nThe report comes to very different conclusions than the Congressional Budget Office and independent analyses of theHouse package,which generally found that the overall bill would produce muted growth and add to the national debt and interest costs, even after its economic impact is taken into account. Also,lower-income Americans would be left worse offafter factoring in the massive spending cuts.\nThe council projects that the economy would be 4.6% to 4.9% larger and corporate investment would be 7.3% to 10.2% higher, after taking inflation into account, in the first four years after the legislation is enacted. The economy would grow a little more than 1% faster, on average, per year.\nAlso, the typical family with two children would see their after-tax take-home pay rise by $7,600 to $10,900, in part because wages would be higher. And roughly 7 million jobs would be saved or created.\nThe tax provisions include making permanent several business tax cuts and the individual income tax breaks in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as temporary tax relief for tipped workers, senior citizens, workers who earn overtime and the construction of new factories, among others. (The tax measures in Senate and House versions differ somewhat so the two chambers would have to unify the legislation before sending it to Trump\u2019s desk.)\nLooking over the next decade, the council forecasts that the bill\u2019s tax provisions and Trump\u2019s economic agenda would slash the deficit by $8.5 trillion to $11.1 trillion. Debt as a share of the economy would fall to 94% in 2034, compared to rising to 117% if the 2017 tax cuts are allowed to expire at year\u2019s end.\n\u201cWe expect this to not only create another low-inflation economic boom, pushing up the supply side of the economy like the president had in his first term, but also to restore fiscal sanity and bring the deficit and debt ratios down,\u201d Stephen Miran, the council\u2019s chair, told reporters on Wednesday.\nTheCBOfound that the House bill would increase the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade, after factoring in the economic impact. That\u2019s an even larger deficit increase than the$2.4 trillion impactCBO projected under a previous forecast that did not account for economic effects. The difference stems from the impact of higher interest costs because of increased interest rates.\nThe economy would expand by an average of 0.5% over the decade, after taking inflation into account, the CBO projects.\nMiran countered that the CBO report does not factor in Trump\u2019s full economic agenda. Also, he said the best way to help lower-income Americans is to create a strong economy that would fuel job and wage growth.\nAsked whether the roughly $2.8 trillion revenue estimate from tariffs would hold if the US enters intotrade dealswith other countries, Miran said that any agreements would open foreign markets to more US products, which would bring in more tax revenue so he doesn\u2019t expect much of a difference.\n\u201cSome countries may make such aggressive concessions they convince the president to drop tariffs below 10%, but at the same time, I expect there will also be some stubborn holdouts that result in tariff rates that are higher than where we are now,\u201d said Miran, noting that he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d that there will be a \u201cflurry\u201d of frameworks announced beforeTrump\u2019s July 9thdeadline.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/25\/business\/trump-big-beautiful-bill-cea-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"The US economy likely just had its worst quarter since Covid","date":"2025-04-29","body":"President Donald Trump\u2019s major, abrupt policy shifts likely slowed the US economy sharply in the beginning of the year \u2014 for the worst quarter perhaps since the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014 as consumers and businesses fretted about massive new tariffs.\nThe Commerce Department is set to release its initial estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, on Wednesday at 8:30 am ET. It will give the clearest picture yet of how the US economy is responding to Trump\u2019s sweeping economic agenda, just one day afterthe administration\u2019s 100th day in power.\nEconomists estimate that GDP expanded at an annualized rate of 0.8% in the first quarter, adjusting for inflation and seasonal swings, according financial data firm FactSet, which would be the weakest rate since the second quarter of 2022. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, meanwhile, is forecasting a sharp decline of 2.5%, which would mark the worst quarter since mid-2020.\nGDP likely slowed due to higher imports as American consumers and businesses rushed to beat Trump\u2019s tariffs (when imports exceed exports, that subtracts from GDP); weaker spending early in the quarter as unusually harsh cold weather kept shoppers hunkered down; and companies pausing investments over uncertainty stemming from Trump\u2019s policies, among other factors.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise in the data from storms, people front-loading and some payback for the strength in the fourth quarter,\u201d Nathan Sheets, global chief economists at Citigroup, told CNN. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got this economic concern from how tariffs are going to affect the economy and markets that people are really struggling with.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has been on a chaotic tariff spree over the past few months to address a massive trade deficit that Trump has referred to as a\u201cnational emergency\u201d\u2014 and the deficit has actually gotten worse in recent months.\nSo far, Trump has levied 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel; 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada that aren\u2019t compliant with a free-trade agreement among the countries; a staggering 145% duty on Chinese imports; a 25% tariff on cars, with separate tariffs on auto parts coming at a later date; and a 10% baseline tariffs on all US imports.\nAmassive tariff hike on dozens of countriesbriefly went into effect on April 9, though Trump swiftly delayed that hike that same day until July. He also introduced temporary exemptions for some electronic goods, and he has said separate tariffs are likely coming down the pike on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper and timber.\nChina has retaliated at every juncture, jacking up its tariffs on US imports to a bruising 125%, though Trump has hinted ata potential U-turnin his trade spat with the world\u2019s second largest economy. The European Union and Canada have also vowed to fight back against the US tariffs.\nAmerica\u2019s trade deficit, meanwhile, got worse in the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s second term, according to government data. In January, the trade deficit ballooned 34% to $130.6 billion, the largest on records going back to 1994. The deficit shrunk to $122.7 billion in February, according to the latest data, but that was still the second-biggest trade deficit ever. (Trump took office on January 20, so the data for that month also reflects the end of the Biden administration.)\n\u201cIf you look at what drove the widening in the trade deficit, it was mostly industrial supplies and consumer goods, durable items that aren\u2019t perishable,\u201d said Nicole Cervi, an economist at Wells Fargo.\nAmerican consumers and businesses overwhelmingly power the US economy with their spending, and economists say there were signs that spending was sputtering in the first quarter.\nTrump\u2019s unpredictable trade war hassignificantly weighed on America\u2019s economic mood in recent months, according to various sentiment surveys, jeopardizing consumer demand moving forward.\nFor consumers, much of the first-quarter spending weakness came near the start of the year, mostly due tounusually harsh cold weather and wildfires in Los Angeles, according to economists. In January, spending on goods and services declined 0.3%, while retail sales saw an even steeper decline of 0.9%, according to Commerce Department data. Spending made a weaker-than-expected recovery in February.\nThen in March, retail sales skyrocketed atthe strongest monthly pace in more than two yearsas Americans rushed to get ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs, driven mostly by spending on cars and auto parts. However, that boost will likely prove temporary.\nOn the business side, recent surveys from the US-based nonprofit Institute for Supply Management have similarly shown that businesses are feeling uneasy over Trump\u2019s policies in both the manufacturing and services sectors. That skittishness hasn\u2019t translated into weaker business spending yet.\nNew orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft \u2014 a closely watched proxy for business investment \u2014 declined 0.3% in February, then rose by a tepid 0.1% in March.\n\u201cThere was a hint of softness\u201d in those numbers, wrote Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at finance firm William Blair. Even though consumers and businesses were worried about Trump\u2019s tariffs, business investment in March \u201cheld up well.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/29\/economy\/us-gdp-first-quarter-trump-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

It can also no longer rely on red-hot demand for its exports in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, which is increasingly producing locally many of the goods that it used to import from Europe.\nAccording to Brzeski, German industrial production remains about 10% below its pre-pandemic levels. Possible higher tariffs from the incoming US administration could make the situation worse because of the potential impact on German exports and\u201cthe effect on German investments if companies were to move production to the US,\u201d he said.\nGermany\u2019s central banksaidlast month that economic stagnation was set to continue this year, with GDP \u201conly beginning to make a slow recovery over the course of 2025.\u201d\nThe GDP data bodes ill for the wider European economy, which has struggled to grow significantly after the pandemic and will also potentially face a more fractious relationship with one of its biggest trading partners, the United States.\nData from the European Union\u2019s statistics office Wednesday showed that industrial production in the 20 countries that use the euro increased slightly in November compared with October.

{"title":"Furloughed federal workers file for jobless benefits, but aid isn\u2019t easy to get","date":"2025-10-25","body":"Right after setting her out-of-office email on October 1, one furloughed US Department of Agriculture worker filed for unemployment benefits to help her pay for food, rent and other necessities during the federal government shutdown.\nMore than three weeks later, her application is still listed as pending \u2013 forcing her to borrow from family and friends as the impasse continues with no end in sight. The Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance told her she may have to wait up to three months to receive her first payment, though she will receive a lump sum for all the missed weeks of claims.\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t help me now,\u201d  said the worker, who asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation. \u201cThe rent is due on November 1.\u201d\nThe USDA staffer is among the nearly 20,600 furloughed federal employees who have filed for unemployment benefits during the first three weeks of the shutdown, according to Andrew Stettner, director of economy and jobs at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. Initial jobless claims for federal workers have soared to their highest level since the record 35-day shutdown that ended in January 2019.\nIs the federal government shutdown affecting you? Tell us about it\nThat compares to 635 initial claims filed by federal workers for the week ending September 13, according to the most recent data published by the US Department of Labor before the impasse.\nMaryland and Texas have the highest number of initial claims, with more than 3,100 filings each, said Stettner, who analyzed unemployment data filed in 49 states and territories.\nMore workers are expected to file for unemployment compensation in the coming weeks since manymissed their first full paycheckson Friday and more will do so in coming days.\nUnlike in previous shutdowns, many are concerned that they may not receive back pay or have a job to go back to after the shutdown ends. The Trump administration has called into question a2019 lawthat guarantees retroactive compensation for furloughed workers and has tried tolay off morethan 4,000 workers during the impasse. (A federal judge recentlypausedthe administration\u2019s efforts to downsize the federal workforce during the shutdown.)\nStill, only a small share of the estimated 670,000 furloughed federal employees have applied for jobless benefits. There are multiple reasons why most of them don\u2019t file claims, including the hassle in having their wages verified, the delay in getting payments and the fact that they\u2019ll have to repay the benefits once the shutdown ends and they receive their back pay.\nPlus, the benefits are only a fraction of what many federal workers receive in compensation. The maximum weekly payment in Washington, DC, is $444, $430 in Maryland and only $378 in Virginia, for instance.\nThe Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program is similar to traditional state jobless benefits, but it differs in significant ways that could delay getting money into the hands of furloughed staffers.\nState unemployment offices have the wage records of private-sector employers, but they don\u2019t have that information for the federal government. So, the states must contact the federal agencies to verify the employment and salary for each claimant. But many of the workers who would handle such requests have been furloughed themselves, said Stettner, who also served as a senior US Department of Labor official in the Biden administration.\n\u201cFederal workers should apply for unemployment benefits. They don\u2019t know how long the shutdown is going to be,\u201d he said, noting it\u2019s akin to an interest-free loan. \u201cBut it\u2019s really, really hard. There are a lot of barriers.\u201d\nSome states are trying to smooth the process for furloughed workers. Washington\u2019s Employment Security Department, which has had more than 1,800 federal employees file for benefits, held a webinar earlier this week that drew nearly 500 participants and is offering another one next week. Maryland\u2019s Department of Labor has awebpagespecifically for furloughed federal staffers and contractors. Utah\u2019s Department of Workforce Services posted anFAQfor affected federal employees on its site.\nBen Emmel, a senior analyst at the Government Accountability Office, decided to file for unemployment benefits two weeks ago, but the Maryland resident was only able to submit his application on Friday because he had to resolve an identity verification issue first.\nSeveral of his colleagues around the country have also had problems filing claims, said Emmel, who is president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers Local 1921.\nEven when he gets the benefits, the weekly payment will only cover a trip or two to the grocery store for Emmel, who is married with four young children.\nFederal employees aren\u2019t the only ones being hit hard by the shutdown. Many contractors who work for federal agencies have also been furloughed, although they don\u2019t have the same guarantee of getting their back pay that federal staffers do.\nContractorscan also run into issues filing for jobless benefits. Sharon, a contractor for the Drug Enforcement Administration, visited a Washington, DC, unemployment office after having difficulty applying online. After waiting in line, she still didn\u2019t get clear answers about her eligibility or next steps.\n\u201cI\u2019m super frustrated,\u201d she said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/25\/politics\/furloughed-federal-workers-unemployment-claims","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The US economy added 119,000 jobs in September, but unemployment rose to a nearly four-year high","date":"2025-11-20","body":"Along-awaited jobs reportoffered a mixed picture of the US labor market.\nThe economy added 119,000 jobs in September, an unexpected rebound for the labor market \u2014 but it comes as the overall economy shows signs of slowing. However, the unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, the highest it\u2019s been in nearly four years.\nEconomists were expecting 50,000 jobs to have been added and an unemployment rate that remained at 4.3%, according to FactSet.\nDelayed for seven weeks due to the government shutdown, the latest snapshot of America\u2019s job market showed that unemployment rose in September to the highest level in nearly four years.\nIn addition, August\u2019s tepid job gains of 22,000 were revised to a job loss of 4,000 jobs and July was revised down by 7,000 jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday.\nThe health care and social assistance sector continued to drive overall employment growth. Those sectors added an estimated 57,100 jobs in September, accounting for nearly half of the overall gains. Leisure and hospitality contributed 47,000 jobs during a month with unseasonably warm weather.\nJobs were lost in sectors such as transportation and warehousing (-25,300), temporary help services (-15,900) and manufacturing (-6,000).\nAlthough the September employment data has been on the shelf since early October,it provides a critical snapshotof the labor market at a time when tariffs, stubborn inflation and elevated interest rates continue to slow the US economy.\nPlus, Thursday\u2019s report might very well be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since theshutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during Octoberand part of November. The BLS on Wednesday announced that there will not be a separate October jobs report published but instead some of that data will be included in the November report scheduled for December 16.\nDespite the stronger-than-expected September gains, this year is still on pace for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.\n\u201cThe job market was really weak in the summer, and it didn\u2019t improve much in September,\u201d said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Credit Union. \u201cWhat we learned today is that both June and August had negative job growth, so, shedding jobs; 119,000 is pretty good for September, but when you step back, the average (monthly job gain) of the past four months is in the low 40,000s.\u201d\n\u201cSo, it looks very weak,\u201d she added.\nUnemployment, a closely watched recession indicator, ticked higher in September, rising to the highest rate since October 2021.\nHowever, driving the jobless rate higher was an increase in the labor force \u2013 primarily an uplift in more people looking for work, versus a sharp increase in layoffs, BLS data shows.\nThe job gains remain heavily concentrated. Two sectors \u2013 health care and social assistance, and leisure and hospitality \u2013 accounted for 87% of September\u2019s job growth.\nBut in a labor market that\u2019s been in a low-hire, low-fire slog, there are also few opportunities for those seeking work. On average, it\u2019s taking people six months to find work, according to the latest BLS data.\nThe latest unemployment claims data supports that trend: In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that an estimated 1.974 million people filed continuing claims for unemployment insurance for the week ended November 8, hitting a fresh four-year high.\nInitial claims, which are considered the best proxy for layoff activity, fell to 220,000 last week, remaining well below more concerning thresholds (300,000 to 400,000 range, consistently).\n\u201cIf I had to characterize it, it still looks a lot like \u2018no-hire, no-fire,\u2019\u201d Long said. \u201cI do worry, given the number of industries that are starting to fire, that this is starting to look like \u2018no-hire, start-to-fire.\u2019\u201d\nDespite the mixed bag of data, the September report \u201ccould throw cold water\u201d on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates further when it meets in December, Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\u201cThe sharp rebound in employment gains, up 119,000 in September following the downwardly revised negative 4,000 print in August soothes concerns that the labor market was on the precipice of a large downturn and removes urgency for another rate cut,\u201d she wrote.\nStill, because of the historic government shutdown, the September jobs report will be the freshest official monthly employment snapshot available when the Fed makes its next interest rate decision on December 10. The partial October and full November data won\u2019t come out until the following week.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/20\/economy\/us-jobs-report-september-final","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"There\u2019s no jobs report today. So here\u2019s what we know about the US labor market","date":"2025-10-03","body":"On this particular Friday, at 8:30 a.m. ET, the Bureau of Labor Statistics was supposed to release the September jobs report.\nInstead, the agency behind the market-moving release \u2014 data that has starkly become even more important, given economic uncertainty \u2014 isalmost entirely darkdue to thefederal shutdown. There will be no more employment data until the government is funded again.\nIn the absence of official data, a constellation of previously reported federal data, private metrics, economists\u2019 analyses, Federal Reserve indicators and job seekers\u2019 lived experiences can help cobble together a rough snapshot of the current US labor market.\nHere\u2019s a look at what we know \u2014 and what we don\u2019t.\nConsensus estimates, according to financial data firm FactSet, are that the economy added 50,000 jobs in September, a pickup fromAugust\u2019s preliminary 22,000-job gain, and the unemployment rate held pat at 4.3%.\nBaked in to that estimate was an expectation that private-sector firms would add 62,000 jobs while the government (primarily the federal sector) would post a 12,000-job loss.\nWage growth and the average workweek (a metric watched to gauge whether hours are being cut) were expected to be unchanged from August, when pay gains rose 0.3% monthly and 3.7% annually and the average workweek was 34.2 hours.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the story last year, where you had a very weak summer of hiring and then hiring picked up again a bit in September,\u201d Brett Ryan, senior US economist at Deutsche Bank, told CNN this week. \u201cI expect something similar, but not nearly as much of a bounce-back as last year.\u201d\nIn September 2024, the US added 240,000 jobs \u2014 a robust increase that pretty much matched the entire gains of June, July and August (when job growth averaged 82,000 per month).\nHiring is considerably weaker this year. During the past three months, job growth has averaged 29,333 jobs per month. The makeup of the US labor force also has changed.\nThe US unemployment rate can hold steady even the country adds fewer jobs than last year,economists say, noting morepeople aging out of the workforce, a rise in discouraged job seekers, a reduced flow of immigrants and rising deportations of workers.\n\u201cLast year, it probably took about 130,000 (jobs) per month to keep the unemployment rate steady; this year, it\u2019s probably more like 50,000 or below,\u201d Ryan said.\nIt\u2019s still not clear how much of the recent labor market slowdown can be attributed to lower immigration, JPMorgan economist Abiel Reinhart wrote earlier this week, noting a sudden loss of such labor could boost openings in affected industries.\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey report for August, which was released on Tuesday, showed that construction job openings were nearly halved,plunging by 115,000 roles \u2014 the second-largest drop on record.\n\u201cThis could also reflect underlying business challenges in that sector,\u201d Reinhart noted.\nConstruction, which is closely watched as an indicator of economic activity, has been dogged by a combination of high interest rates, a persistent housing affordability crisis, deportations of workers and tariff-related uncertainty.\nThe foreign-born labor force has declined after peaking earlier this year, BLS data shows. However, the drop-off could also be attributed to people refusing to answer surveys or not indicating their nativity status, economists note.\nEven without the official September jobs data, industry-specific trendsthat showed up in the August reportand for much of this year are expected to continue.\nHealth care, which has contributed the lion\u2019s share of overall job growth this year, likely continued driving employment gains in September.\nHere\u2019s what the industry breakdown looked like in August:\n\u201cHealth care has been one of the stalwarts of the labor market \u2026 the need for health care has grown as the population ages,\u201d Nela Richardson, chief economist at payroll giant ADP, said Wednesday. \u201cAbout 10,000 individuals turn retirement age every day in the United States; that adds up to about 4 million retirements every year.\u201d\nADP\u2019s monthly snapshot of private-sector employment, which was released Wednesday, showed that health services and education added the most jobs in September, as employment slumped elsewhere. ADP estimated that private-sector businesses lost 32,000 jobs in September because of ongoing uncertainty as well as apreliminary data revision.\nIn a low-hire, low-fire market with few options for workers \u2014 especially those in white-collar industries \u2014 health care is becoming an attractive option.\nSarah Loyd, a single mother with two degrees, has been in and out of the labor force for the past four years. Jobs have been increasingly harder to come by in her field of marketing.\n\u201cI\u2019m sending out emails to schools now to get back into school to pivot into health care \u2014 just to find any semblance of stability,\u201d Loyd, 35, told CNN.\nStill, the lack of broad-based employment gains makes the US even more vulnerable to a shock, economists warn.\nHiring activity has been listless this year, and the latest data isn\u2019t showing much of a turnaround.\nIn September, a month whenbusinesses\u2019 job boards are typically filled with seasonal postings, hiring announcements were the weakest in more than a decade, according to new data Thursday from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\nLayoff activity thankfully doesn\u2019t seem to be accelerating, but those who are unemployed are having a really hard time getting back into the workforce.\nContinuing jobless claims, which are submitted by people who have filed for at least a week or more of unemployment, have been hovering at around four-year highs, Department of Labor data shows.\nAnd in the August jobs report, 25.7% of unemployed people were actively job seeking for at least 27 weeks. Outside of the pandemic years, that\u2019s the highest share for that duration since June 2016, BLS data shows.\nAmong the bevy of regional Fed data, a new index from the Chicago Fed indicated similar unemployment activity as seen in August.\nThe Chicago Fed Real-Time Unemployment Rate Forecast, updated this week, projected an unemployment rate of 4.34% for September (up a hair from 4.32% in August); a rate of 2.1% for layoffs and other separations (roughly unchanged from 2.09%); and a rate of 45.22% for hiring of unemployed workers (a slip from 45.61%).\nA separate new indicator from the San Francisco Fed showed that state-level unemployment is still largely under control.\nAs of mid-September, only seven states\u2019 unemployment rates increased at least 0.5 percentage points above their prior 12-month lows, according to the Weekly Labor Market Stress Indicator.\nThe current suite of non-federal labor market data paints a mixed picture, but one with some bright spots.\nFor example, ZipRecruiter\u2019s recent employer surveys support the longstanding idea that there is pent-up demand just simmering beneath the surface.\n\u201cAll of these data points say that the majority of businesses plan to increase hiring in the next 12 months, which is encouraging,\u201d Nicole Bachaud, ZipRecruiter\u2019s labor economist, told CNN.\nOn main street America, the September employment trends \u2014 including workforce participation, hours worked and wages \u2014 are generally in line with where they\u2019ve been in recent years, said Raymond Sandza, vice president of analytics and data at small business payroll company Homebase.\nAt a time when economic anxiety is high, stable\u2019s not too shabby.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing stark, nothing out of the ordinary,\u201d Sandza said. \u201cThat said, things have not felt great for Main Street for the last three or four years. There was no post-Covid boom time for them, it\u2019s just always been hard.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/03\/economy\/no-jobs-report-data-snapshot-september","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The US economy added 151,000 jobs in February in first full jobs report under Trump\u2019s second term","date":"2025-03-07","body":"Employment growth rebounded in February as the US economy added 151,000 jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday.\nThe unemployment rate, however, edged up to 4.1% from 4% the month before. The labor force participation rate slipped as well.\nEmployment growth came in a little under economists\u2019 expectations for a 160,000-job gain, but picked up from January, a month where wildfires and weather likely affected the numbers: January\u2019s payroll growth was revised down to 125,000 from 143,000.\nOn one hand, February\u2019s jobs report marks another month of seemingly solid job gains and a continuation of a historic expansion of the US labor market.\nOn the other, it provides a \u201ca snapshot of a prior age, before the shift in federal government policies undermined confidence,\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to investors on Friday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s either the calm before the calm, or the calm before the storm,\u201d economist Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida\u2019s Institute for Economic Forecasting, wrote Friday.\nIn recent weeks, the Trump administration has made monumental policy shifts \u2014 including large-scale federal layoffs, funding cutbacks, a back-and-forth on tariffs and mass deportations \u2014 that have spilled into the broader economy, shaking business and consumer confidence, and tripping several economic warning signals.\nHowever, the Department of Government Efficiency-driven employment cuts weren\u2019t expected to make a big splash in February\u2019s jobs report. That\u2019s partly because of timing of the two surveys that feed into the monthly employment snapshot and also due to the structure of employment separation agreements.\nStill, Friday\u2019s report gave a hint of what could come: The federal government posted a loss of 10,000 jobs for the month, with 3,500 of those losses coming from the US Postal Service.\nThat dampened employment gains in the broader public sector, which has been one of three key drivers (health care and leisure and hospitality being the others) of overall job growth with most of the credit going to strong gains in state and local governments.\nIn February, the overall government sector gained only 11,000 jobs, the lowest monthly total since April 2024. For the federal government, it was the worst month for job losses since June 2022.\n\u201cThe economy is off to a slow start under the new president,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote in commentary on Friday. \u201cYou can\u2019t have mass firings of federal workers and government contractors and think it is not going to mean job losses for the private sector.\u201d\nThat\u2019s expected to be the case in the weeks and months to come, according to new data released Thursday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which has tracked layoff announcements since 1993. The number of job cuts announced in February was north of 172,000, marking the 12th highest total on record.\nThe health care sector, which has been the biggest driver of employment growth in recent years, continued to post strong gains, adding 52,000 jobs last month. However, the top job creator, sector that relies heavily on federal support (including funding and grants) is also under threat: President Donald Trump is reining in federal spending as he aims to extend his costly 2017 tax cuts.\nHouse Republicans areadvancing a budgetthat would bring major cuts to Medicaid, a federal program used by 72 million Americans \u2014 which also supports tens of millions of jobs. Experts say the program will likely suffers cuts at some points, but it\u2019s unclear how exactly spending will be reduced and how quickly those cuts will begin to affect providers.\nTrump on Friday touted data that showed the US manufacturing sector added 10,000 jobs in February. He delivered remarks from the Oval Office, flanked by a bar chart displaying the estimated 10,000-job gain in comparison to 111,000 manufacturing jobs lost in the past 12 months of the Biden administration.\nTrump attributed the February gains to his administration\u2019s policies around trade, tariffs and plans to expand factory and manufacturing jobs in the US.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been gearing up, they\u2019ve had a little time,\u201d he said of manufacturing employers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just five weeks, it\u2019s five weeks plus a few months. They put it into effect pretty quickly.\u201d\nEconomists on Friday noted that the pickup in manufacturing and sectors such as construction were welcome signs for labor market stability and overall economic activity. However, the tick up in manufacturing jobs could also be a reflection of \u201csome front-loading ahead of expected tariffs,\u201d Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JP Morgan, noted Friday.\nThe February jobs report painted a picture of a pretty solid and stable labor market, but one that also is exhibiting some softness:\nThe jobless rate ticked up, the labor force participation rate dipped; the employment-to-population ratio fell; average workweek hours dropped; the number of part-time workers for economic reasons increased; and the number of multiple jobholders was on the rise.\n\u201cIt does suggest to me that some employers are cutting back on hours rather than cutting jobs outright, that that the demand for workers is fairly soft,\u201d Julia Pollak, chief economist for employment site ZipRecruiter, told CNN in an interview.\nRelated articleTrump visited their local grocery store during the campaign. They\u2019re holding on to hope that prices fall\nHowever, that\u2019s not the case in all industries. Leisure and hospitality businesses lost jobs for the second consecutive month, driven by cuts at restaurants and bars.\nRestaurants lost 27,500 jobs in February, piling onto the 29,500 jobs lost in January (which was the biggest monthly hit since Covid times), BLS data shows.\nSmall businesses, especially those in food service, have struggled with the lingering effects of high inflation and especially high interest rates, she said.\n\u201cRestaurant jobs often serve as an entry point into the labor market, giving people a leg up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe struggles of restaurants, it\u2019s not a coincidence that they are accompanied by a decline in the participation rate. I think there are people on the sidelines who would be coming into work if that first rung of the ladder were strong.\u201d\nConsumer spending fell in Januaryfor the first time in nearly two years and saw the biggest monthly drop-off since February 2021, according to Commerce Department data released last week.\nThe continued softness in the labor market leaves the economy with \u201clittle room for error as it braces for impact from an exodus of federal workers as well as potential trade-related job losses,\u201d Noah Yosif, chief economist at the American Staffing Association, said in commentary Friday.\n\u201cThe modest uptick in new opportunities in the labor market, coupled with significant downside risks for separations from is a flashing yellow light for the Fed as it refocuses on inflation, affirming that interest rates cannot stay higher for too long without consequences,\u201d he said.\nThe churn that\u2019s needed for a healthy labor market has slowed significantly in recent months. Businesses aren\u2019t hiring as much, folks aren\u2019t eager to quit, and those without jobs are staying on the sidelines for longer.\nBut even for businesses seeing strong revenue growth, the current political and economic climate is too volatile to allow for hiring.\nThat\u2019s the case for Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Astropad, which sells hardware and software productivity tools for reading, writing and drawing, such as Rock Paper Pencil, a textured iPad screen protector coupled with a custom ballpoint Apple Pencil tip that replicates the sensation of writing and drawing on paper.\nThe company, founded in 2013 and boostrapped from the outset, has grown to about a dozen employees and notched a 40% sales gain last year. However, Astropad has had to hold off on adding more workers, because it is heavily exposed to the effects from higher tariffs.\nIt manufactures most of its hardware products in China, in part because the US supply chain for the products needed are limited or non-existent.\n\u201cOne day, it\u2019s tariffs on China; the next day, it\u2019s tariffs on Canada and Mexico; and they\u2019re off, and then they\u2019re on again,\u201d Matt Ronge, Astropad\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer, told CNN. \u201cSo, that really puts us in a holding pattern where we want to see what happens.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Bryan Mena contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/07\/economy\/us-jobs-report-february-final","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Jobless claims spike, in worrisome sign for the US labor market","date":"2025-02-27","body":"First-time applications for unemployment benefits rose much more than expected last week, a likely indication of some \u201cnoisy\u201d data, but also a potential worrisome hint that cracks may be forming inAmerica\u2019s long-solid labor market.\nThere were an estimated 242,000 jobless claims filed last week, according to seasonally adjusted data released Thursday by the Department of Labor. That\u2019s an increase of 22,000 from the prior week\u2019s tally and a figure that landed well above economists\u2019 expectations for 220,000 claims.\nIt\u2019s the largest weekly spike in claims in more than four months and the weekly claims \u2014 a proxy for layoffs \u2014 are at their highest level since early December, Labor Department data shows.\nInitial claims data, while one of the timeliest indicators of labor market health, also can be quite volatile and fluctuate from week to week due to factors such as weather, temporary layoffs, other state-level factors, and holidays.\nIn addition to last week being a holiday week, adeadly winter stormandfrigid coldhit many states.\nHowever, considering that the Trump administration is taking a figurativechainsaw through the employment ranks of the US government, the weekly claims data has risen in importance.\nBased on Thursday\u2019s data, it\u2019s not yet known to what extentthe widespread layoffs occurring within the US governmentare pushing up claims.\nIn Thursday\u2019s report, Washington, DC, reported an increasing number of first-time claims; however, nearby Maryland and Virginia showed the opposite for the week ended February 22.\nAlso, it\u2019s important to note that initial state-level data has quirks and caveats of its own, and proper comparisons can\u2019t be made until additional time has passed.\nFederal worker-specific unemployment data is lagged by a week, and Thursday\u2019s report did not indicate a meaningful jump from the week before.\nRelated articleDOGE\u2019s heavy-handed approach is not likely to make the government more efficient\n\u201cWe will have to wait another week for the detail on precisely how many initial claims were filed nationwide by former Federal civilian employees, but the number totaled 614 in the week ending February 15, up just one \u2014 that\u2019s not a misprint \u2014 on the previous week,\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief US economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to investors on Thursday. \u201cIt will take another week or two for the job cuts implemented mid-month to come through fully in the claims data.\u201d\nAlso, it\u2019s possible that hundreds of thousands of government workers could be laid off as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency slash roles; however, the impact on US labor market data might not happen in one fell swoop, economists say.\n\u201cDo not expect a bursting of the pipes in initial claims and unemployment yet,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US, said Thursday. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s more likely to be a steady drip, drip, drip in the pace of firings.\u201d\nWhile some federal employees have been laid off in recent weeks, others are serving out a paid notice period where they essentially quit but won\u2019t be unemployed weeks or even months from now.\n\u201cThere\u2019s likely to be some upward pressure in terms of the claims data, but I\u2019m not expecting a 200,000 surge in the numbers,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN in an interview.\nAlso, these layoffs aren\u2019t expected to drag down February\u2019s jobs report, Daco said.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be more in the March jobs report just because of the timing of these layoffs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, let\u2019s not forget, even if we\u2019re talking about \u2019200,000 jobs lost\u2019 at the federal level, that\u2019s only a month of job growth that we would lose. It\u2019s significant, but it\u2019s a one-time hit in terms of the impact on the broader economy.\u201d\nThe direct consequences are \u201cmaybe a tenth\u201d of a percentage point of economic growth over the course of a year, Daco said.\nHowever, he cautioned, that\u2019s not where the biggest concern lies.\n\u201cThe risk here is thatyou get a knock-on effectof individuals that lose their job and don\u2019t find a new occupation in a different sector, and for those jobs, those individuals, they suddenly have to rely on unemployment payments, and they\u2019re likely to scale back on their outlays, and that will then, in turn, affect broader economic activity,\u201d he said.\nRelated articleMass layoffs of federal workers could hurt families and local economies \u2014 but may not dent the overall economy\n\u201cThat can have a consequence for sectors that are also dependent on federal spending, so contractors and those individuals might also be putting back on their spending. That\u2019s the indirect effect that can be more significant there,\u201d he added.\nThe February jobs report is scheduled to be released on March 7; and, for now, economists are expecting employment growth to pick up from January, which was likely weighed down by seasonality as well as wildfires and weather, economists say.\nEconomists expect the US to have added 160,000 jobs in February, an increase from January\u2019s initial estimate of 143,000 jobs gained, according to FactSet consensus estimates.\nStill, while job growth has eased and returned to pre-pandemic levels, the natural churn within the labor market (hirings and quits) have slowed dramatically, making it harder for unemployed people to find work.\nThursday\u2019s report showed that continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received at least one week of unemployment benefits, dropped slightly by 5,000 to 1.862 million for the week ended February 15.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/02\/27\/economy\/us-jobless-claims-layoffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Takeaways: Powell says the Fed has delivered enough rate cuts for now","date":"2025-12-10","body":"The Federal Reserve on Wednesdaylowered interest ratesagain in a continued effort to keep the labor market intact, despite objections from several key Fed officials who believe the central bank should be prioritizing the higher cost of living instead.\nHowever, it may be the last rate cut for a while.\nIn a post-meeting news conference, Chair Jerome Powell said additional rate cuts will be tougher to justify, frequently stressing that central bankers have now lowered rates three times this year.\n\u201cWe are well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves,\u201d Powell said.\nA majority of policymakers voted to lower the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point for the third consecutive time, to a range of between 3.5% to 3.75%, the lowest in more than three years.\nWednesday\u2019s decision drew three dissents \u2014 from Fed Governor Stephen Miran, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee \u2014 the highest number of dissents since September 2019.\nIt\u2019s also the fourth consecutive meeting that a Fed decision wasn\u2019t unanimous, the longest stretch since 2019.\nIn their latest economic projections, Fed officials penciled in just one rate cut next year, unchanged from their estimate in September. However, their latest policy statement suggests they\u2019re leaning toward staying on hold in the near term, stating they will \u201ccarefully assess\u201d the \u201cextent and timing\u201d of any additional cuts.\nPowell confirmed that interpretation of the statement when speaking with reporters.\nThis year\u2019s rate cuts have been in response to mounting signs of a weakening labor market, including unusually slow job growth and higher unemployment among young people and minorities.\nBut those decisions haven\u2019t been easy, with the Fed\u2019s powerful rate-setting committee starkly divided on how to proceed with interest rates. While job growth has been stagnant, inflation remains well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target and is widely expected to creep higher next year as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs pack a bigger punch.\nFed officials are in disagreement in Powell\u2019s final few meetings at the helm of the central bank, clashing over which side of their dual mandate to prioritize: full employment or stable prices.\nWhen asked whether the heated Fed debate can be counterproductive or even negative, Powell said policymakers have had \u201cthoughtful, respectful discussions.\u201d\nMiran cast a dissenting vote, just he did in the prior two meetings, backing a larger, half-point cut instead. Schmid, who also dissented at the prior meeting, again preferred to keep rates unchanged, this time joined by Goolsbee.\nBut the unusual division among Fed officials isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as Powell noted during his news conference. Several experts have told CNN that some level of disagreement moderates the Fed\u2019s behavior and shows there isn\u2019t groupthink.\n\u201cYou have one tool. You can\u2019t do two things at once,\u201d Powell said of the Fed\u2019s tough task of managing interest rates with both sides of its dual mandate under stress.\nStill, it makes it more difficult for Wall Street to assess the path of monetary policy.\nIn the weeks after the Fed\u2019s October decision when officials lowered rates for the second time this year, investors were split over whether there would be another rate cut in December \u2014 until New York Fed President John Williams weighed in.\nWilliams serves in a role that\u2019s historically closely aligned with the Fed chair, and in a November 21 speech, Williams said the bigger risk is around the labor market\u2019s health. Wall Street\u2019s expectations for a December flipped to around 70% from 40% after Williams spoke, according to futures.\nPowell said the outlook for interest rates is murky, but the release of economic data that had been delayed by the government shutdown should at least help inform officials for their January meeting.\nThe Labor Department next week releases inflation and employment data for October and November, which could easily shift the economic narrative in either direction.\nThis year\u2019s string of rate cuts shows the central bank has been prioritizing the labor market, and Powell said a big reason is that conditions might be weaker under the surface.\n\u201cThere is an overcount in the payroll job numbers, we think,\u201d Powell said, adding that job growth might even be negative. \u201cI think a world where job creation is negative, I think we need to watch that situation very carefully, and be in a position where we are not pushing down on job creation with our policy.\u201d\nPowell said the Fed\u2019s actions to take pressure off the labor market doesn\u2019t indicate the central bank is not concerned with inflation remaining elevated.\n\u201cEveryone should understand, and the surveys show that they do, that we are committed to 2% inflation, and we will deliver 2% inflation,\u201d Powell said. \u201cBut it is a complicated and usual difficult situation, where the labor market is also under pressure.\u201d\nOn inflation, Powell blamed the gradual increase in inflation over the past year on Trump\u2019s sweeping patchwork of tariffs, but said officials broadly expect it to result in a one-time increase in the price level.\n\u201cIt is really tariffs that are causing most of the inflation overshoot,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe do think of those as likely\u2026 to be a one-time price increase.\u201d\nFed officials\u2019 expectations for just one cut in the coming year is in stark contrast with Trump\u2019s persistent demands for massive rate cuts.\nThe president has said he\u2019s close to naming the next Fed chair, to succeed Powell once his term ends in May. Trump said Tuesday in an interview with Politico that Powell\u2019s successor will be expected to cut rates, which wouldn\u2019t be easy for that person to accomplish because of the Fed\u2019s structure.\nThe Fed chair has only one vote and cannot unilaterally veto the majority\u2019s policy decisions, meaning Trump\u2019s pick for Fed chair will have to persuade their colleagues to go along with several more rate cuts.\nTwo Fed officials who become voters next year \u2013 Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan and Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack \u2013 have already expressed in recent public speeches reservations with lowering rates further. Among the Fed\u2019s 12 regional bank presidents, only four get voting power each year on a rotating basis, in addition to the New York Fed president, who has a permanent vote.\nWhen asked by CNN\u2019s Matt Egan on what he would want his legacy as chair to be, Powell said: \u201cI really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape.\u201d\n\u201cI want inflation to be under control, coming back down to 2%, and I want the labor market to be strong. That is what I want,\u201d he added.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/10\/economy\/fed-december-rate-decision","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"With Fed rate cuts behind us, AI and bonds are now on Wall Street\u2019s mind","date":"2025-12-11","body":"Wall Street got therate cutit wanted. But with the Federal Reserve set to take a more cautious approach to trimming interest rates in 2026, investors are now left to wrestle with other concerns that had been put on the back burner while Fed rate cuts were top of mind.\nThe Fed\u2019s three consecutive cuts inSeptember,OctoberandDecemberhelped markets climb higher and look past nerves about artificial intelligence and uncertainty abouttariffs.\nWith Fed Chair Jerome Powell telegraphing that rate cuts might be on pause for a while, Wall Street\u2019s focus is turning elsewhere. And uncertainty that had been bubbling under the surface becomes harder to ignore when there isn\u2019tFed rate-cut optimism to help boost stocks.\nLingering concerns about AI are resurfacing, while recent moves in the bond market are giving some investors pause.\nTakeaways: Powell says the Fed has delivered enough rate cuts for now\nOne concern: While AImight not be in a bubblethat\u2019s about to burst, there is genuine uncertainty about just how profitable every company with enormous aspirations is going to be \u2014 and whether the spending taking place will be justified.\nWall Street is taking a more scrupulous look at AI companies\u2019 earnings results. Oracle shares (ORCL) slumped 10.83% on Thursday after the company reported third-quarter results that just missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\nOracle shares are down 39% since hitting a record high in September.\n\u201cOracle is entering into the heaviest phase of its AI infrastructure buildout, and [the third quarter] highlighted the timing mismatch of buildout spend to revenue conversion,\u201d analysts at Bank of America said in a note.\nAI and tech stocks have helped carry the market higher in recent years. So when investors sell shares, it can weigh on the broader market.\nTech shares came under pressure on Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA) fell 1.53%, while Alphabet (GOOG) fell 2.27%, weighing on the Nasdaq, which closed lower by 0.25%.\nInvestors rotated into other sectors, pushing the Dow higher by 646 points, or 1.34%, to close at a record high. The S&P 500 gained 0.21% and also closed at a record high.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised to see near-term optimism in the markets, given that the Fed continues to cut rates even though the economy is growing,\u201d Chris Zaccarelli, CIO at Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.\n\u201cHowever, we think the rose colored glasses may come off once investors realize that the path to lower interest rates may take longer \u2014 or may not materialize at all \u2014 to the extent that they believe it will,\u201d Zaccarelli said.\nAffordability\u2014 and the cost of living \u2014 are front and center in discussions about the economy. President Donald Trump continues to lambast the Fed for not lowering rates as fast as he\u2019d like.\nThe Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate influencesborrowing costslike credit card rates. But it\u2019s long-term bond yields \u2014 like the 10-year Treasury \u2014 that influence borrowing costs like mortgage rates.\nWhen the Fed cuts rates, bonds tend to rally, pushing down yields \u2014 and resulting in lower borrowing costs.\nBut the opposite recently happened: The 10-year yield just hit its highest level in three months before falling on Wednesday.\nThe Fed just cut interest rates for the sixth time. Here\u2019s why you\u2019re not seeing much of a difference in your loans\nIt\u2019s a sign that investors could be nervous that inflation might be a more persistent issue. (So they demand a higher yield to compensate for that potential inflation eating into their return).\nAnd it\u2019s also a stark reminder that while Trump wants lower rates, the bond market will have the final say in determining key borrowing costs.\nOther items on bond investors\u2019 minds:\n\u201cBond investors aren\u2019t following the Fed\u2019s easing script,\u201d Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a note. \u201cThey remain concerned about large US federal budget deficits and mounting US debt. They can see that inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s 2.0% target. They are also seeing soaring bond yields in Japan.\u201d\nTo Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, AI and bond yields present two potential \u201cheadwinds\u201d for markets as investors look ahead to 2026.\n\u201cAs it becomes more and more evident (obvious) that the AI industry is not going to be as broadly profitable\u2026or as quickly profitable\u2026as the market is pricing in, it\u2019s going to create some serious headwinds in our opinion,\u201d Maley said.\nMeanwhile, \u201cjust as important\u201d for markets is the prospect that bond yields continue to rise, Maley said.\nHigher bond yields broadly correspond to higher borrowing costs, which can constrain the spending and business activity that can help juice stocks. Meanwhile, higher bond yields can also pull investors away from stocks.\n\u201cThis pattern of rising long-term interest rates is highly unusual when we look at the historical reaction during Fed cutting cycles,\u201d Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo, said in a note. \u201cThe bottom line is that \u2026 investors across all asset classes need to think about why\u201d this is happening.\nAnd it\u2019s occurring at a time when tech companies \u2014 like Oracle \u2014 are raising debt to help finance their aspiration for building infrastructure to support the AI boom. Those borrowing costs could rise if bond yields rise.\n\u201cWe believe that 2026 is going to face some real problems,\u201d Maley said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/11\/investing\/bond-market-yields-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"The Fed just cut interest rates for the sixth time. Here\u2019s why you\u2019re not seeing much of a difference in your loans","date":"2025-12-10","body":"Thanks to its latest decision on Wednesday \u2013 its final one for 2025 \u2013 the Federal Reserve has now reduced its key overnight lending rate by 1.75 percentage points since it began its rate-cutting cycle in September 2024.\nSince the fed funds rate affects a ton of consumer lending and savings rates throughout the economy \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 it\u2019s worth assessing whether the full magnitude of the Fed\u2019s cuts (or at least the 150-basis-points drop prior toWednesday\u2019s decision)has filtered through to consumers over the past 15 months.\nThe answer in several instances \u2013 at least when you look at averages \u2013 is no.\nThere was a time not so long ago when you could find savings rates of 5% with your eyes closed. That\u2019s over, of course. But you can still find some low-risk ways to earn solid,inflation-beating returns on your cash.\nOnline high-yield savings accounts:While traditional savings account rates at large banks barely cross the 0% mark regardless of what the Fed does, online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks have not fallen nearly as much as the 150-basis-points drop in the fed funds rate prior to today\u2019s move. Many still offer inflation-beating returns in the 3.4% to 4.2% range, according to Bankrate.com.\nFed lowers interest rates for the third time in a row\nKen Tumin, founder of DepositQuest.com, said the five big online high-yield savings accounts he tracks (at Ally, Amex, Discover, Marcus and Synchrony) have only fallen on average by 83 basis points. One reason why, he suggested, may be because financial institutions had started to lower rates ahead of the Fed\u2019s first cut in 2024. But also, he added, the online banks can\u2019t afford to lower their rates too much because they need to compete for deposits with the biggest banks.\nCertificates of deposit:The story is similar with CDs.The average online 1-year CD annual percentage yield has only fallen by 55 basis points, Tumin said.\nAt Schwab.com on Wednesday, CDs of varying maturities, from three months to 10 years, offered rates between 3.62% to 4.19%.\nShould the Fed decide to keep cutting rates next year, a no-penalty CD can be a good way to lock in a reasonable rate now and avoid the normal penalty you\u2019d pay if you take money out of your CD before it matures, Tumin suggested. At Marcus, for instance, there is a 13-month no-penalty CD on offer at 3.95%.\nThat penalty is also a moot point when you a buy a CD through your brokerage, where you can choose from a wide array of bank CDs to find the best rate and term for your needs. The risk you face with a so-called brokered CD is an investment risk if you want to cash out before it matures. That is, you have to sell it and you may not get back as much as you paid for it.\nTreasuries and municipal bonds:Treasury bills and notes, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States,are one of the lowest risk ways to earn a return while preserving your principal. And the interest you earn is typically exempt from state and local income taxes.\nTreasury yields are influenced by the fed funds rate, but they also can move on economic and geopolitical concerns. As of Wednesday on Schwab.com, average rates for Treasury bills with maturities from three months to one year ranged between 3.64% and 3.71%. The rate on the two-year note was 3.62%. The average 10-year Treasury had a yield of 4.19%.\nWith an eye toward more Fed rate cuts next year, \u201creturns on cash will continue to decline, making high-quality bonds with intermediate-term maturities more attractive for long-term investors,\u201d analysts at LPL Financial said in their 2026 outlook.\nHigh-quality municipal bonds also offer a tax break \u2013 interest earned is typically exempt from federal taxes, and if you buy a muni issued by the state or city where you live, it may be exempt from state and local taxes too.\nAverage yields on AAA-rated municipal bonds with durations of between three months and 10 years ranged from 2.15% to 4.15% on Wednesday at Schwab.com.\nMoney market funds:One area where rates have taken a hit in the past 15 months is money market funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments.\nAs of December 9, the average annualized 7-day yield was 3.73%, according to Crane Data. That\u2019s well below the roughly 5% average yield on offer in the summer of 2024.\nBut a low-cost money market fund can still provide a solid inflation-beating return for your cash.\nThe fact that many consumer rates haven\u2019t fallen as much as the fed funds rate since September 2024 isn\u2019t great news if you\u2019re taking on debt.\nBut remember, when it comes to borrowing, Fed cuts aren\u2019t the only way to lower your payments. The rate you get will also depend on your credit score, how much you\u2019re borrowing and how much you shop around.\nCredit cards:The average rate on credit cards has fallen to 19.83% as of last week, down about a percentage point from the 20.78% average in mid-September 2024, according to Bankrate.\nAny cut in rates can save you money, but with rates so high already, the cuts won\u2019t be enough to make your debt truly affordable.\nRather than waiting on the Fed, you would be better off applying for a low-fee 0% balance transfer card that can buy you up to 21 months to pay off your balance interest-free. If you don\u2019t qualify for one, call your lender and just ask for a lower rate. Even if they knock it down by a few points that will still save you more than incremental cuts from the Fed.\nHome loans:While mortgage rates have moved up and down in the past 15 months, as of last week, the average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.19%, nearly identical to the 6.20% registered in mid-September 2024.\nThat\u2019s because mortgage rates are only indirectly affected by Fed rate decisions.\nMore Americans are taking out riskier adjustable-rate home loans\n\u201cMortgage rates are primarily influenced by long-term interest rate dynamics, which are shaped by the fiscal outlook, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rather than just the Fed\u2019s short-term policy rate,\u201d LPL analysts noted in their 2026 outlook. \u201c(They) are also influenced by the inflation outlook and growth projections.\u201d\nGiven expectations for a weakening job market and possibly slower economic growth, LPL analysts expects those factors \u201cto push investors toward safer assets like U.S. Treasuries, reducing long-term yields \u2014 the primary benchmark for mortgage pricing.\u201d Their prediction: The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate could fall to the upper-5% range by the end of next year.\nOne area of home debt where rates have dropped noticeably is on variable-rate home equity lines of credit. As of last week, the average rate was 7.81%, according to Bankrate \u2013 well below the 9% to 11% registered 15 months ago. Home equity loan rates have also fallen \u2013 albeit more modestly. The average rate on a five-year HEL last week was 7.99%, below the 8.46% registered in mid-September 2024.\nAuto loans:Average auto loan rates for new and used cars have only come down about half a percentage point since September 2024, far less than the drop in the fed funds rate, according to November 2025 data from Edmunds.com.\nTwo primary reasons may explain why, according to Joseph Yoon, Edmunds\u2019 consumer insights analyst.\nFirst, there traditionally has not been a one-to-one correlation between the Fed\u2019s moves and car loans.\nSecond, the best promotional rates are typically offered for loans that don\u2019t exceed 60 months. But the average length of a loan is now around 70 months. And, Yoon said, \u201cConsumers are strained. They\u2019re putting less money down, so have to borrow more,\u201d Yoon said.\nNot to mention that average new car prices have been going up,topping $50,000for the first time in September.\nEnd result: Average monthly payments have actually gone up a little, too, although perhaps less than they would have, had the Fed not cut at all.\nTo get the best and most affordable deal if you\u2019re shopping for a new car, Yoon suggests looking at those that have been sitting on a dealer\u2019s lot for more than 60 days. \u201cThat\u2019s somewhere you may find a little value,\u201d he said.\nFor new EVs, you might seek out dealers or manufacturers offering a discount equivalent to the EV tax credit you would have received, had it not expired in September.\nAnd for used cars, \u201cthe best values right now are for used EVs coming off lease from 2022 and 2023,\u201d Yoon said. \u201cThe technology for EVs is moving very quickly, so they\u2019re depreciating very quickly. And that depreciation has already hit for those models.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/10\/business\/consumer-interest-rates-savings-debts-fed","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Mortgage rates fall to lowest level of 2025","date":"2025-10-23","body":"Americans frustrated by high home borrowing rates may have gotten some welcome news this week.\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped to 6.19% for the week ending October 23, down from 6.27% last week, according to Freddie Mac data released Thursday.\nAfter years of sluggish activity, sidelined homebuyers may finally be ready to jump back in, with mortgage rates now at their lowest level in more than a year and home prices softening across many major metro areas.\n\u201cAt the start of 2025, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage surpassed 7%, while today it hovers nearly a full percentage point lower,\u201d Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement.\nWith the government shutdown halting most economic data, the sharp one-week drop in mortgage rates stands out as one of the few indicators still being released. Freddie Mac, despite being under federal conservatorship, isn\u2019t affected by the shutdown and continues to publish its weekly survey.\nHome borrowing rates are falling as markets see an October rate cut by the Federal Reserve as a \u201cnear certainty,\u201d said Kara Ng, a senior economist at Zillow Home Loans.\n\u201cWith signs of softer economic momentum and a deteriorating labor market, mortgage rates may drift slightly lower through 2026,\u201d Ng said. \u201cStill, Zillow expects the 30-year fixed rate to remain confined within the 6%\u20137% range observed in recent years.\u201d\nWhile the Fed doesn\u2019t control mortgage rates, its actions can influence them by affecting the 10-year Treasury yield.\nLower mortgage rates and softer home prices might be improving the housing affordability picture for many Americans still looking to break in to homeownership.\nIn September, the typical home sold for 1.4% below asking, according to a report released last week from Redfin. That is the biggest September discount since 2019, before thepandemic-era surge in demandcaused home prices to spike.\nWould-be homebuyers might finally be regaining some leverage \u2014 and many are starting to notice. September sales of existing homes rose by the fastest pace in seven months, according to a separate report released by the National Association of Realtors on Thursday.\n\u201cAs anticipated, falling mortgage rates are lifting home sales,\u201d Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement. \u201cImproving housing affordability is also contributing to the increase in sales.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/23\/economy\/us-mortgage-rates","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Takeaways: Fed Chair Powell says don\u2019t count on a December rate cut","date":"2025-10-29","body":"The Federal Reserve on Wednesdaylowered interest ratesfor the second time this year in a continued bid to prevent unemployment from surging.\nBut another rate cut at the next meeting in December \u201cis not a forgone conclusion,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference, adding there were \u201cstrongly differing views\u201d among policymakers on how to move forward.\nFed officials voted for another quarter-point rate cut, lowering their benchmark lending rate to a range between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest in three years.\nWednesday\u2019s decision drew two dissents; one from Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who backed a larger, half-point cut; and another from Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who preferred to hold borrowing costs steady.\nIt is the first time since 2019 that there were dueling dissents \u2014 both calling for easier and tighter policy \u2014 underscoring the heated debate among officials over how President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping policies on trade, immigration and spending are affecting the US economy.\nTo make matters more complicated, it was also the first time officials have set monetary policy while lacking an entire month of crucial government employment figures in the modern era.\nCentral bankers began to lower rates last month after data through August showed employers were adding jobs at the weakest pace since 2010. Major companies such as Amazon and Target have recently announced tens of thousands of layoffs.\nThe problem: A prolonged government shutdown could stand in the way of further rate cuts, especially with some officials such as Schmid concerned about persistent inflation pressures in the economy.\n\u201cWhat do you do if you\u2019re driving in the fog? You slow down,\u201d Powell said.\nPowell made it clear that the Fed doesn\u2019t have the full picture of the economy\u2019s health without government data.\nThe Fed\u2019s latest policy statement noted that \u201cmore recent indicators\u201d were \u201cconsistent\u201d with earlier data, before the shutdown, that showed weak hiring and slightly higher unemployment.  Powell said as much when taking reporters\u2019 questions.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no story over the last four weeks, it\u2019s kind of stable,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see anything that says that the job market, or really any part of the economy, is making a significant deterioration.\u201d\nData from payroll software provider ADP released this week showed that hiring picked up in September, but remained weak. And while there have been prominent layoff announcements in recent weeks, that doesn\u2019t immediately translate to higher unemployment. Workers who\u2019ve been laid off sometimes receive generous severance packages.\nPowell mentioned that private data cannot replace government figures, which are widely known as the \u201cgold standard\u201d of measuring the world\u2019s largest economy. And the persistent absence of those figures could put future rate cuts at risk.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious,\u201d Powell said.\nThe inflation situation also remains murky, Powell said.\nSo far, inflation hasn\u2019t surged due to new tariffs that have gone into effect, according to the latest Consumer Price Index, largely thanks to businesses managing higher costs without passing the buck to consumers.\nThe Fed chief said that officials expect \u201cthat there will be some additional increased inflation because it takes a while for tariffs to work their way through the production chain and, finally, get to consumers.\u201d\nEconomists widely expect tariff inflation to pick up as well, especially if Trump makes good on his recent tariff threats.\nThe September CPI, which was released last week despite the shutdown, for Social Security\u2019s cost-of-living adjustment, was cooler than economists had predicted, but it showed persistent price pressures that could worsen because of Trump\u2019s tariffs. Trump is meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jingping late Wednesday US time for a wide-ranging discussion in South Korea, which will likely include a potential US-China trade deal.\nPowell reiterated that there\u2019s a \u201creasonable\u201d expectation that tariff inflation may be short lived, which helped pave the way for September\u2019s rate cut. But that would also remain unclear if the October CPI, which is scheduled for November 13, isn\u2019t released because the shutdown persisted. Fed officials normally look to the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, widely known as their preferred inflation measure, but that figure also hasn\u2019t been released due to the shutdown.\nPowell said once the tariffs have kicked in, the hope is that \u201cthey stop generating inflation,\u201d reflecting a one-off effect.\n\u201cThis is how we believe and hope that it will work out,\u201d Powell said.\nIn a separate decision, policymakers announced the end of a three-year process to shrink the size of their enormous portfolio by December 1.\nThe Fed\u2019s portfolio, or balance sheet, reached about $9 trillion in mid-2022, but is now around $6.6 trillion after a careful effort to reverse the stimulus it introduced into the economy during the Great Recession and the Covid-19 pandemic. It\u2019s a tool that works in the background while the Fed\u2019s key interest rate does much of the heavy lifting to achieve its macroeconomic goals. Officials have judged that the balance sheet is close to a more normal state.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/29\/economy\/fed-october-rate-decision","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Americans haven\u2019t been this worried about rising unemployment since 2009, survey shows","date":"2025-03-28","body":"Americans are not only increasingly fearful of higher inflation \u2014 with President Donald Trump set to announce a sweeping spate of tariffs in just a few days \u2014 but many more are now dreading rising unemployment.\nConsumer sentiment tanked 12% this month, the University of Michigan said in its latest survey released Friday. That was a slightly steeper decline than the one reportedin a preliminary readingearlier this month. Respondents blamed Trump\u2019s erratic trade war for their jitters, the survey said.\n\u201cConsumers continue to worry about the potential for pain amid ongoing economic policy developments,\u201d Joanne Hsu, the survey\u2019s director, said in a release. \u201cNotably, two-thirds of consumers expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead, the highest reading since 2009.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Trump is set to announce duties that match the ones foreign countries impose on the United States, so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he has referred to as \u201cthe big one.\u201d Trump this week already escalated his trade war by announcing25% tariffs on all car imports, taking effect on April 3. So far, Trump has slapped tariffs on metals and doubled duties on China to 20%.\nRelated articleTrump\u2019s tariffs could push up costs even if you\u2019re not buying a new car\nThe Michigan survey\u2019s \u201cexpectations\u201d index, which captures respondents\u2019 outlook for the economy, plummeted 18% \u201cand has now lost more than 30% since November 2024,\u201d according to a release. And this time, it wasn\u2019t just Democrats and Independents feeling dour; Republicans also grew gloomier, \u201cexpressing worsening expectations since February for their personal finances, business conditions, unemployment, and inflation.\u201d\nAmericans\u2019 expectations for inflation in the year ahead climbed to 5% this month, up from 4.3% last month, reaching its highest level since November 2022. Meanwhile inflation expectations in the next 5 to 10 years also surged, rising to 4.1%, which was the highest level since February 1993, when it was also 4.1%.\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural for people to expect higher prices because we haven\u2019t seen a trade war like this since McKinley,\u201d Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial, told CNN\u2019s Matt Egan.\n\u201cSentiment is soft data. We\u2019re used to soft data being abysmal. It doesn\u2019t usually line up with what they do,\u201d Hogan added. \u201cThe ongoing battle between soft and hard data has yet to be resolved.\u201d\nSo far, Federal Reserve officials have maintained that long-run inflation expectations mostly remain in check. That could quickly change if expectations continue to trend in the wrong direction. And if consumers\u2019 prediction of rising unemployment bears out, that stands to make the Fed\u2019s job even more complicated.\nThe Fed pays close attention to people\u2019s perception prices because they can be self-fulfilling; if people expect inflation to climb and remain elevated in the coming years, then they\u2019ll likely adjust their spending accordingly. Officials have said they\u2019ll recalibrate their plans if it\u2019s clear that expectations have indeed taken a turn for the worse.\n\u201cIf inflation expectations are threatening to become unanchored or becoming unanchored in the long term, then the balanced approach may not work,\u201d St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said Wednesday at an event in Paducah, Kentucky. That would mean the Fed will \u201cprobably lean in to the inflation side\u201d of its so-called dual mandate, which is to promote full employment and stabilize prices.\nIn that case, any further rate cuts would be off the table for the foreseeable future.\nBut now, there\u2019s also the possibility of the US economy weakening as shoppers curb their spending. When the economy weakens more than expected, pushing up unemployment, the Fed usually responds by lowering borrowing costs. Fresh data out Friday showed that consumer spending rebounded in February, advancing 0.4% for the month, after declining 0.3% in January, though people cut back notably on dining out and hotel stays.\nConsumer spending accounts for about 70% of economic output, so if that key economic engine begins to sputter, it wouldn\u2019t bode well for the broader US economy.\n\u201cThe latest consumer health check revealed consumers are increasingly apprehensive about spending amid sticky inflation trends and pre-emptive inflation anxiety from tariffs, flagging consumer sentiment and rising job insecurity,\u201d Lydia Boussour, senior economist at Ernst & Young, said in commentary issued Friday.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/28\/economy\/us-consumer-sentiment-march","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

There\u2019s a couple of labor market concerns growing,\u2019 but they\u2019re not overly worried.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s some comfort and confidence that they can arrest the (labor market) slowdown before it gets away from them,\u201d Shah added. \u201cAnd the Fed cuts give a little bit of extra juice to the (stock) market.\u201d\nSince 1980, when the Fed has cut rates while the S&P 500 is trading near all-time highs, the index has risen across the next 12 months about 90% of the time, according to research from Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.\n\u201cCorporate profits continue to be the north star for the market and will be critical to monitor,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cFor now, the bull market continues to earn the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\nWhile stocks grind higher, uncertainty always lingers.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday upheld the image of a united and data-dependent Fed, which helped give a boost of confidence to investors.

Thank the Fed \u2014 but not entirely","date":"2025-09-18","body":"The Federal Reserve\u2019srate cut this weekis rippling through the housing market, sending mortgage rates lower and spurring a jump in refinancing.\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.26% for the week ending September 18, down from 6.35% last week, according to data released Thursday by Freddie Mac.\nThis is the fourth-straight week of declines as mortgage rates fell in anticipation of the Fed\u2019squarter-point rate cuton Wednesday.\nA growing number of homeowners who locked in mortgages at higher rates over the past few years are jumping in to take advantage of savings.\nRefinance application volume jumped nearly 60% last week, compared to the week before, according to a separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association.\nAlthough the Fed has signaled that more rate cuts will come, it is unclear whether mortgage rates will continue dropping on a steady path. Mortgage rates don\u2019t directly track the Fed\u2019s moves. Instead, they follow the 10-year Treasury yield, which measures investor expectations for future inflation and economic growth.\nThe Fed is currently battling bothstubborn inflationand a weakening labor market, making its future monetary policy moves murky.\nThe 10-year has reflected that uncertainty, briefly dropping lower after the Fed announced a rate cut on Wednesday, only to climb even higher in the hours afterward. Those volatile moves may directly impact mortgage rates.\nSome mortgage lenders warn that borrowing costs may not fall much further.\n\u201cMortgage rates are forward-looking, and by the time the Fed announces a cut, markets have usually already priced it in,\u201d said Bill Banfield, Rocket Mortgage\u2019s chief business officer. \u201cRates may stay relatively flat in the short term since markets had already priced in this cut.\u201d\nStill, more buyers are turning to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), betting that rates will decline further in the coming years. The share of borrowers choosing ARMs has climbed to its highest level since 2008, according to the MBA report.\nUnlike fixed-rate loans, ARMs can provide temporary relief by offering lower initial rates. But they carry risk: after the introductory period \u2014 typically five, seven, or ten years \u2014 the rate resets and adjusts with the market. If rates rise in the future, borrowers could see their monthly payments climb as well.\nOrphe Divounguy, a senior economist with Zillow\u2019s Economic Research team, said a weakening economic outlook may tamp down demand for housing, even as mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year.\n\u201cIn times of economic uncertainty, residential mobility stalls; buyers, sellers and renters stay put,\u201d he said. \u201cHeading into the slower season of the housing cycle \u2014 when school, holidays and cooler weather dampen housing activity \u2014 the impact of any small changes to mortgage rates up or down is likely to be muted.\u201d\nAt his press conference on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said some of the housing market\u2019s affordability issues may be too big for the central bank to tackle, given its limited mandate. Powell highlighted the steep shortage of homes for sale, which has driven home prices higher.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deeper problem here; that\u2019s not a cyclical problem that the Fed can address, and that is just a pretty much nationwide housing shortage,\u201d Powell said.\n\u201cA lot of places in the country just don\u2019t have enough housing for people,\u201d he added.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/18\/economy\/mortgage-rates-september-18","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"A key market data point is signaling fear about America\u2019s economy","date":"2025-09-14","body":"While the stock market hovers nearrecord highs, a shift in the bond market is signaling mounting concerns about the economy\u2019s health.\nA bevy of data this month showed the labor market is onshakier groundthan previously thought. That spurred a rally in bonds as investors sought safe havens and ramped up bets thatthe Federal Reserve will cut interest ratesthis week.\nAs bonds rallied, it pushed yields lower: The two-year Treasury yield this month hit its lowest level since 2022, and the 10-year yield hit its lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump announced an unprecedentedtariff campaignthat sparked fears of an economic slowdown.\nThe decline in Treasury yields shows markets are adjusting to the reality of a weaker-than-expected job market and expectations for potentially subdued economic growth.\nThe Fed, which has held its benchmark interest rate steady since December, is widely expected to lower rates at its policy meeting this week amid a slowing labor market. Investors are flocking to Treasuries to lock in the current relatively high rates ahead of expected Fed rate cuts.\nLabor Department data released on Thursday showed one of the biggest weekly increases injobless claimsin more than a year. That came after separate data earlier this month showed the unemployment rate in August ticked up to 4.3%, its highest level since 2021. The US economy also added911,000 fewer jobsfor the year ending in March than previously thought, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data this month.\nTreasuries are seen as relatively risk-free assets because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. When investors expect a slowdown, they often move cash into Treasuries as a sure bet to ride out the uncertainty.\n\u201cThe bond market is acknowledging that job creation, a powerful engine of the US economy, is decelerating,\u201d said Chip Hughey, managing director for fixed income at Truist Advisory Services.\nUS job growth through March was significantly weaker than previously thought\nThe two-year Treasury yield tracks expectations for the Fed\u2019s rate policy, and has swiftly dropped as markets have adjusted to the prospect of rate cuts. The 10-year yield, meanwhile, tracks expectations for economic growth.\n\u201cThe yield declines we are seeing right now can be viewed as a recalibration for an expected step-down in economic activity \u2014 not recessionary \u2014 but softer in comparison to the past few years,\u201d Hughey said.\nThe 10-year yield \u2014 a key benchmark for borrowing costs across the economy \u2014 fell from 4.27% at the start of the month to briefly dip below 4% on Thursday.\nA decline in the 10-year yield can lead to lowermortgage ratesand more affordable loans. But a swift decline in the 10-year yield is not always a good sign: It could signal investors think the economy is weakening.\n\u201cYields are coming down because the market is expecting slower growth ahead,\u201d said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. \u201cThat\u2019s the assumption behind why the Fed will cut rates, because the job market is deteriorating.\u201d\nMatthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, on Friday said he raised his expectations for interest rate cuts this year. Luzzetti now expects three quarter-point cuts across September, October and December.\n\u201cWith recent data showing further weakness in the labor market and somewhat more modest inflationary pressures than anticipated, we have brought forward one rate cut from next year,\u201d Luzzetti said in a Friday note.\nDouble whammy for Americans: Inflation continues to rise as jobs outlook grows weaker\nBank of America earlier this month also revised its expectations for the Fed to cut interest rates. The bank now expects a quarter-point cut in September and December, after previously forecasting zero cuts this year.\n\u201cThe August jobs report is likely to amplify the Fed\u2019s concerns about labor market weakness,\u201d Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at Bank of America, said in a September 5 note.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much interest rates will be slashed. Traders are pricing in a 96% chance the Fed will cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point this week, with a 4% chance of a jumbo half-point cut.\nWhile investors are adjusting to the reality of a weaker labor market, consumer spending this year has remained relatively robust, supporting outlooks for economic growth, according to Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at US Bank Asset Management Group.\nConsumer spending rose 0.5% from June to July, according to Commerce Department data. Economic growth in the second quarter, as measured bygross domestic product, also came in stronger than expected.\n\u201cConsumer spending continues to be the engine for growth,\u201d Merz said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing signs of that cracking yet, but we\u2019re watching that carefully, because there\u2019s obvious weakening in the labor market at this point.\u201d\nAmericans kept spending last month despite elevated inflation\nAnd while nerves about a labor market slowdown are at the forefront of investors\u2019 focus, concerns about inflation still linger.\nThe Fed is in a tricky spot, balancing a weakening labor market while inflation remains relatively elevated. A core measure ofConsumer Price Indexthat excludes volatile food and energy prices rose 3.1% year-over-year in August, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s well above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\u201cShort-term (borrowing) rates are coming down faster than long-term rates, and that is also a bit of a signal of concerns about long-term rates and how much they can decline in this environment of a great deal of uncertainty aboutfiscal deficits, inflation remaining high and not turning lower,\u201d said Jones of Charles Schwab.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/14\/markets\/us-treasury-bond-market-fed-rate-cuts","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The Fed may cut rates later this year. Here\u2019s how to get the most from your cash savings now","date":"2025-07-30","body":"Despite unprecedented public needling from President Donald Trump to lower interest rates, the Federal Reserve boardstood paton Wednesday.\nBut the US central bank is still widely expected to cut its key overnight lending rate at least once if not twice this year, possibly as soon as its next meeting in mid-September.\nAny Fed move (or inaction) on its key rate has a direct effect on many savings and borrowing rates throughout the economy \u2014 and an indirect one in the case of mortgages, which are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield.\nBut if this is truly the last meeting before the Fed starts cutting rates again \u2014 and ifconcerns that the economyand especially the job market may weaken in the coming months \u2014 it\u2019s more important than ever to maximize the return on your cash savings and minimize your debt payments on a sustained basis.\nThe Fed holds interest rates steady for the fifth-straight time\n\u201cConsumers should continue to aggressively pay downhigh-cost debtand pad theiremergency savings,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cLess debt and more savings equates to additional breathing room and financial flexibility, regardless of the path the economy takes.\u201d\nYou\u2019ll need money close at hand to pay for any upcoming big expenses like a down payment or tuition; emergencies; and, if you\u2019re in or near retirement, living expenses for a year or more so you\u2019re not forced to tap investments when markets are down.\nFor these kinds of cash savings, there are several attractive options that offerinflation-beating returns.\nHigh-yield online savings accounts:The average FDIC-insured high-yield savings accounts at online banks will likely pay you much more than brick-and-mortar bank savings accounts.\nRates this month have been as high as 4.44%, well above the 0.56% national average, according to Bankrate.\nWhen the Fed cuts rates, the yields on these accounts will also move down. But if the Fed cuts in total no more than half a percentage point this year, as traders expect, you\u2019re still likely to see at least some online high-yield savings accounts offer rates around 4% for the rest of the year, said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com, which is now owned by Lending Tree.\nMoney market accounts:The same expectation applies to money market accounts, Tumin said.\nThough they typically require higher minimum deposits, many FDIC-insured MMAs have been offering rates of between 3.8% and 4.3%, Bankrate found.\nMoney market funds:These funds are not FDIC-insured. But they nevertheless are considered a very low-risk way to get better yields because they invest primarily in shorter-term government securities.\nThe average 7-day yield among the top 100 money market funds was 4.12% as of July 29, according to Crane Data.\nNo-penalty CDs:If you want a good return on money you can easily access, consider a no-penalty certificate of deposit from an online FDIC-insured bank.\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, top rates on no-penalty CDs with terms of six months to a year ranged between 4.30% and 4.45%, per Bankrate.\nNormally, if you take money out of a CD before its term ends you pay a financial penalty. But with a no-penalty CD, that deterrent is removed so long as you keep the money in there for at least a week, Tumin said.\nUnlike with an online high yield savings account \u2014 the rate on which will fall when the Fed starts cutting rates \u2014 a no-penalty CD lets you lock in today\u2019s yield for up to a year while still giving you flexibility to access your money when needed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best of both worlds,\u201d Tumin said.\nFor money you\u2019ll need within a year or two, or within three to five years,you might consider some select investments in Treasuries and municipal bonds, a bond mutual fund or a bond exchange-traded fund.\nTreasuries:Backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, Treasury bills and notes are considered very low risk. And you may get a tax break for investing in them.\nAs of Wednesday midday, short-term Treasury bills with varying durations from three to 18 months had average yields ranging from 4% to 4.33%, according to data on Schwab.com.\nTreasury notes, with durations from two to 10 years, had average yields of between 3.86% and 4.36%.\nThe interest you\u2019re paid on your Treasury investment is typically exempt from state and local taxes. That\u2019s especially beneficial if you live in a high-tax area. Assuming fairly comparable yields, that may make a Treasury more appealing than a CD, since interest on the latter is subject to federal, state and local tax, Tumin noted.\nBut if you live in a state with no income tax and you\u2019re in a relatively low federal income tax bracket, a CD might be a better bet if it offers a more attractive yield.\nAAA-rated municipal bonds:Another tax-advantaged fixed-income offering is a top-quality muni bond. The interest you\u2019re paid is exempt from federal income tax \u2014 and in some cases, state and local taxes too, if the muni is issued by your home state or city.\nBased on a $25,000 investment, AAA-rated munis with durations of between three months and three years on Wednesday had average rates of between 2.31% and 3.39% on Schwab.com.\nIntermediate-term bonds:Generally speaking, it\u2019s a good time to invest in investment-grade, intermediate-term bonds for money you might not need for two or more years, said Craig Pernick, head of fixed income at Chevy Chase Trust, a wealth management firm.\nTheir valuations are at some of the best levels in 20 years, especially relative to equities, he said.\nIf you\u2019re not working with an investment adviser who can create and monitor a diversified bond portfolio for you, you might invest in a low-cost intermediate-term bond fund or ETF.\n\u201cETFs are a good way to get a piece of that strategy with the least amount of effort,\u201d saidRhode Island-based certified financial planner Sue Gardiner.\nTreasury inflation protected securities (TIPS):If you want to protect your purchasing power in the future, you might consider putting some money in TIPS, which are issued for terms of five, 10 and 30 years.\nThe value of the principal on a TIPS is tied to the Consumer Price Index. So if it rises during the time you hold the security, you will get back more than you paid when the bond matures. If it falls, you still will get back your original amount, according toTreasuryDirect.gov.\nTIPS also pay a fixed rate of interest every six months that is based on the current principal value.\n\u201cFor time frames of five-plus years, a TIPS can be a good alternative to a CD,\u201d Tumin said. \u201cThey will likely do better than CDs if high inflation becomes a problem.\u201d\nGardiner said a TIPS fund might be good for a portion of money you might not need for 10 or more years \u2014 whether for your heirs or yourself. \u201cThe clients I have in TIPS are more conservative investors who want inflation protection on conservative investments.\u201d\nHigh interest rates prevail on various types of consumer loans. And even if the Fed cuts rates several times from September through the end of next year, that still might not do much to make your debts manageable. So take steps to reduce your own burden.\n\u201cThose with debt should look at ways to knock down interest rates themselves,\u201d said Matt Schulz, LendingTree\u2019s chief consumer finance analyst.\nCredit cards:The average card rate is still north of 20%, according to Bankrate. That may come down when the Fed cuts rates, but not nearly enough to make carrying a balance from month to month a good idea.\nYou\u2019ll save a lot of money if you get a zero-rate balance transfer card, which will let you pay off your principal interest free for up to 21 months.\n\u201cA 0% balance transfer credit card is hard to beat, if you qualify,\u201d Schulz said.\nIf you have cash on hand \u2014 say from a home sale or family gift \u2014 you might take advantage of current savings yields to earn passive income that will help you pay down your principal during the zero-rate period, Gardiner suggested. For instance, she said, you might put a third of your cash in a high-yield savings account, another third in a six-month CD or Treasury and the last third in a one-year CD or Treasury.\nIf you can\u2019t get a zero-rate card, Schulz said, you might try to secure a lower interest rate on a personal loan, the average rate on which is now 12.64%, according to Bankrate.\nAnother option: \u201cConsider asking your lender for a lower rate, either by yourself or with the help of an accredited nonprofit credit counselor,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThat works far more often than you\u2019d imagine and the rate reductions can be far larger than any you\u2019re likely to see from the Fed.\u201d\nHome loans:For the week ending July 24, the average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.74%, according to Freddie Mac. That is about the same as it was a week earlier and just a little above its 52-week average of 6.68%.\nWhere mortgage rates go next will be driven by the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which moves on economic factors such as inflation andgrowthand expectations of what the Fed will do next. However, even if the Fed lowers rates in the coming months, some analysts note that some Treasuryyields could go higherif investors demand more of a premium to buy all the additional debt the United States now has to issue to pay for the$3.4 trillion costof the mega tax-and-spending-cuts package signed into law on July 4.\nMeanwhile rates on home equity loans and home equity revolving lines of credit, which are more directly tied to the Fed\u2019s moves, are still high, although not as high as they were. As of July 23, the average was 8.25% for HELs and 8.26% for HELOCs, according to Bankrate.\nWhatever type of home loan you\u2019re seeking, you can improve your chances of getting the lowest rate possible by making sure your credit score is the best it can be, according to Bankrate. And it always helps to  shop around for the best loan terms available.\nCar loans:When it comes to buying new vehicles, the average amount financed in June was $42,861 over 70 months, about $2,000 more than a year earlier, according to data from Edmunds.com. The average APR was 7.3%, the same as it was in June 2024.\nFor used cars, the average financed was $29,315 over 69.8 months \u2014 or roughly $1,200 more than a year earlier. The average APR was 10.9%, below the 11.5% registered in June 2024.\nThat\u2019s why the best bet for reducing your loan burden is to borrow the least amount possible, said Joseph Yoon, Edmunds\u2019 consumer insights analyst.\nWhile you may be eligible for a newauto loan interest deductionfor vehicles purchased in 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, don\u2019t let that push you into signing up for a loan that will strain your budget.\n\u201cTariffs have yet to significantly shift vehicle pricing, and consumers are already testing their budgeting limits, as evidenced by trends like longer loans and record-setting monthly payments,\u201d Yoon said.\nRegardless of what the Fed does in the coming few months, \u201cthe affordability challenges plaguing the car market will remain unchanged,\u201d he added. \u201cFor most car shoppers, any potential tax deduction is likely to be negligible, especially given how interest costs aren\u2019t top of mind when a buyer is signing on the dotted line.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/30\/investing\/maximize-returns-july-interest-rates","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

But Fed watchers took his comments to mean the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee may decide to lower them at its next meeting, in mid-September.\n\u201cWhile a September rate cut is highly probable, it is not a done deal,\u201d cautionedGreg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.\nInvestors nonetheless welcomed the prospect of a rate cut, sendingthe Dow soaring 800 pointson Friday to close at a record high.\nWhenever the Fed does cut interest rates,here\u2019s how it could affect your financial life.\nWhen the Fed cuts its key overnight lending rate, lower rates on bank savings and loans tend to follow. But they may even start slipping a little in advance of any decision on your savings.\n\u201cSavings rates and CD rates will start to slide, and that will pick up speed as we get closer to the actual resumption of rate cuts,\u201d McBride said.\nWhatever happens with rates, one thing likely won\u2019t change: You\u2019re still likely to get the highest interest rates on your savings if you put your money in a high-yield savings account from an FDIC-insured online bank, which has to compete for deposits more fiercely than behemoths like Chase or Bank of America.\nJerome Powell hints long-awaited rate cuts are coming soon \u2014 the first during Trump\u2019s term\nIf you already have money in a CD at a good rate, that rate won\u2019t change, and you\u2019ll get the interest you signed up for. If you locked in a really high rate already and the CD is \u201ccallable,\u201d it\u2019s possible the bank may decide to recall it. If so, it will return your principal to you and whatever interest you\u2019re owed to date.\nAny loan you\u2019ve already taken out with a fixed rate won\u2019t change. Any new loan you\u2019re seeking will likely have a lower rate than you would have seen if the Fed hadn\u2019t cut.\nHowever, unlike the anticipatory rate declines on the interest a bank has to payyouon savings, you\u2019re not likely to see banks drop the interest rates you have to paythembefore they have to.\nWhen it is to the advantage of the lender, rates may be slower to move lower than consumers would like,\u201d said Bobbi Rebell, a certified financial planner atCardRates.com.\nTake new personal loans. \u201cThey tend to lag Fed rate cut changes to the downside,\u201d Rebell noted. But, she added, as in any rate environment, \u201cthe stronger your credit, the more you are likely to see a better loan rate, because you are a more desirable consumer for the lender.\u201d\nYour credit card issuerwill lower your variable rate, mimicking whatever rate cut the Fed makes, thoughthere could be up to a three-month lag, McBride said.\nBut don\u2019t expect to save a ton of money if and when it happens.\nWhy? Credit card rates are crazy high \u2013 the average is still 20.13%, per Bankrate. So a quarter to a half a percentage point cut won\u2019t do too much for you if you carry a balance from month to month.\nMake your money work for you by \u2018laddering\u2019 bonds or CDs\n\u201cThe Fed has to cut rates a lot before it has a measurable impact on households. Remember, the Fed cut rates a full percentage point last year \u2014 and the average credit card rate is still over 20%,\u201d McBride said.\nIn fact, you might have better luck just asking your card issuer for a lower rate.A Lending Tree reportlast year found that about three-quarters of card holders who asked for a lower rate were successful \u2014 by an average of 6.5 percentage points.\nYour best bet, as always, is to keep trying to pay your principal down.\nIf you\u2019re shopping for a home or looking to refinance your mortgage, it\u2019s not clear how influential a Fed rate cut will be on its own.\nMortgage rates are not tied directly to Fed moves, but rather to moves in the yield of the 10-year US Treasury note. And that yield is influenced by a host of economic expectations.\n\u201cInflation, debt and deficits have kept mortgage rates elevated and will likely limit the extent that mortgage rates come down,\u201d McBride said. \u201cUnless the economy starts to keel over, we probably won\u2019t see mortgage rates moving sustainably below 6%.

{"title":"Trump calls for the equivalent of 10 Fed rate cuts","date":"2025-06-19","body":"President Donald Trump on Thursday continued his extraordinary and targeted verbal attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling for a massive 2.5-point reduction in interest rates.\nDespite appointing Powell to the role in 2017, Trump has frequently chastised the Fed chair for keeping rates higher than the president would like. On Wednesday, after a monetary policymaking meeting, the Fed said it would be maintaining rates between 4.25% and 4.5%, noting that the economy remains strong but the path of inflation is uncertain in part because of the enormous tariffs that Trump has placed on foreign goods.\n\u201c\u2018Too Late\u2019 Jerome Powell is costing our Country Hundreds of Billions of Dollars,\u201d Trumpposted on Truth SocialThursday. \u201cHe is truly one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government, and the Fed Board is complicit.\u201d\n\u201cTOO LATE\u2019s an American Disgrace!\u201d Trump continued.\nAn immediate cut of two and a half points would be unprecedented. The Fed generally adjusts its benchmark lending rate up or down by a quarter point, but the size of each rate adjustment is congruent with the economic reality at that moment. For example, when inflation was running at 40-year highs in 2022, the Fed was hiking by as much as three-quarters of a point at a time. Equally, when the economy was ailing during the onset of the pandemic, the Fed cut rates aggressively.\nPowell has refused to respond to Trump\u2019s barbs, instead saying he is focused on the Fed\u2019s mandate to keep inflation low and job growth high. When asked about Trump\u2019s stated desire to nominate a new Fed chair next year when his term expires, Powell said he\u2019s focused exclusively on the present.\nRelated articleTakeaways from the Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold as officials watch Trump\u2019s tariffs and Israel-Iran conflict\n\u201cFrom my standpoint, it\u2019s not complicated,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWhat everyone on the [Federal Open Market Committee] wants is a good, solid American economy with strong labor market and price stability. That\u2019s what we want. Our policy is well positioned right now to deliver that.\u201d\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s economy has been resilient,\u201d Powell said. \u201cPart of that is our stance. We think we\u2019re in a good place on that, to respond to significant economic developments. That\u2019s what matters. That is what matters to us. Pretty much that\u2019s all that matters to us.\u201d\nFed members in their economic projections said they expect two quarter-point rate cuts this year, which would bring rates to around 3.75% to 4%. But Trump has remained unsatisfied.\n\u201cEurope has had 10 cuts, we have had none. We should be 2.5 Points lower, and save $BILLIONS on all of Biden\u2019s Short Term Debt,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have LOW inflation!\u201d (The Fed\u2019s euro zone counterpart, the European Central Bank, has lowered rateseight timesin the past year, not 10.)\nAlthough US inflation has remained low, Powell noted prices may increase in coming months as companies sell off goods that had been in their warehouses, brought in before tariffs, and begin selling items that have a tariff attached to them.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had goods inflation just moving up a bit,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cWe do expect to see more of that over the course of the summer. It takes some time for tariffs to work their way through the chain of distribution to the end consumer. A good example of that would be goods being sold at retailers today may have been imported several months ago before tariffs were imposed.\u201d\nPowell noted that many companies expect to pass tariff costs to consumers. But too much remains uncertain to lower rates at the moment.\n\u201cToday, the amount of the tariff effects \u2014 the size of the tariff effects, their duration and the time it will take are all highly uncertain,\u201d Powell said Wednesday. \u201cSo that is why we think the appropriate thing to do is to hold where we are as we learn more.

But Fed officials have stood pat, waiting to see how his administration\u2019s sweeping policy changes affect the economy first.\nNow there\u2019s another factor that could delay a rate cut: the conflict between Israel and Iran.\nOn Friday, Israel struck at Iran\u2019s nuclear and military sites inan unprecedented attackthat sentglobal oil prices surging. Investors and analysts fretted that a spiraling conflict could send inflation rising across the world, including in the United States. And that could give the Fed further pause at a two-day policy meeting next week.\n\u201cIf this situation were to deepen further and oil prices were to stay durably higher, it would just add to the challenges that the Fed is already facing with the potential for tariffs to push up inflation,\u201d Robert Sockin, senior global economist at Citigroup, told CNN.\n\u201cFed officials have emphasized that they\u2019re not in a rush to cut rates because they don\u2019t know how the tariffs will exactly play through into the economy, but if you have even more upside risks to inflation, you\u2019re probably looking at an end-of-year rate cut only,\u201d he added.\nTrump\u2019s policy shifts on everything from trade to immigration could all raise unemployment and jack up prices. And his frenetic back-and-forth on tariffs has made it complicated for forecasters to estimate with any confidence what the economy could look like in the future.\nFed rate-setters have already said they want to see how Trump\u2019s changes pan out in the economy. With renewed Middle East tensions, that makes even more sense, experts told CNN.\n\u201cMonetary policy is not well-suited to deal with geopolitical shocks, but all this does mean that the Fed will be even more cautious,\u201d said John Velis, Americas macro strategist at BNY Mellon.\nThe Fed, for now, has time to wait before cutting rates again for one key reason: the resilience of the US labor market.\nIn May, employers addeda better-than-expected 139,000 jobsas the unemployment rate held steady at a low 4.2%, according to the Labor Department. First-time claims for unemployment benefits remain relatively low and job openings unexpectedly increased at the end of April, government figures show.\nIn other words, Americans still have jobs \u2014 and the Fed can afford to wait.\nInstead, the Fed could cut if it sees the economy crumbling, even if oil prices are still high \u2014 what investors call a \u201cbad news\u201d rate cut.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how long oil prices remain elevated, which could lead to inflation at the headline level moving up if the conflict widens across the Middle East,\u201d Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo, said in an interview with CNN.\n\u201cBut by the end of the summer, you\u2019ll likely see weaker job growth, and we know that there\u2019s going to be a number of federal employees who took a buyout rolling off payrolls by November, so you could even get a negative number by then,\u201d he said.\nInvestors are betting on a rate cut in October, according to futures. They\u2019ll get the Fed\u2019s own view soon enough: Officials will release a new set of projections next week.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/14\/business\/fed-oil-prices-israel-iran","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Takeaways from the Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold as officials watch Trump\u2019s tariffs and Israel-Iran conflict","date":"2025-06-18","body":"The Federal Reserveheld interest rates steady againWednesday as officials continue to wait for the fallout of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping policy changes and tensions in the Middle East.\nThe central bank left its benchmark lending rate unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it has been since January. Economists widely expect Trump\u2019s erratic trade war to push up prices and eventually cause unemployment to climb.\nSo far, Trump\u2019s tariffs have resulted in a surge of imports into the US, which has taken a toll on economic growth. However, inflation has been tame and the labor market remains in decent shape. Still, Fed officials don\u2019t expect that to last: New economic projections show that officials expect unemployment to rise this year more than estimated in March \u2014 and for prices to pick up more than they previously thought.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference that he expects Trump\u2019s tariffs to eventually translate into higher inflation, but said the extent remains unclear. That will need to become apparent in order for the Fed to lower borrowing costs again, Powell said.\n\u201cWe have to learn more about tariffs. I don\u2019t know what the right way for us to react will be,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard to know with any confidence how we should react until we see the size of the effects.\u201d\nUS stocks took a dive after Powell said it\u2019s difficult for the Fed to forecast with any confidence what the precise impact of tariffs will be on prices.\nFed policymakers overall continue to expect two rate cuts this year, according to the median projection, though seven of them expect no rate cut at all, up from four back in March.\nWhenever the Fed deems it appropriate to deliver a rate cut, it\u2019ll likely be because of rising unemployment \u2014 what investors refer to as a \u201cbad news rate cut.\u201d That\u2019s because American consumers and businesses are expected to soon feel the sting of Trump\u2019s tariffs, economists say, and there are already some potential signs of consumers becoming cautious with their spending.\nRetail sales, which comprise a sizable chunk of overall spending, dropped sharply last month as car purchases plummeted. That\u2019s key because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the US economy.\nPowell stressed that there are still many knowns when it comes to tariffs, including what the impact on prices will be.\nThe Fed leader said that it\u2019s possible that any inflation that comes about from tariffs proves to be just \u201ctemporary,\u201d but that it could also be more persistent. He said the tariffs have already began to reverberate throughout the economy.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re beginning to see some effects. We expect to see more,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had goods inflation just moving up a bit, and, of course, we do expect to see more of that over the course of the summer.\u201d\nHe added that \u201cmany, many companies do expect to put all or some of the effect of tariffs through to the next person in the chain, and, ultimately, to the consumer.\u201d\nThe economy\u2019s future overall, including for prices, largely depends on what happens with trade policy. The Fed in its policy statement said that uncertainty \u201chas diminished\u201d and Powell said that mostly reflects trade tensions easing from a fever pitch early in the spring, when Trump unveiled the sharpest escalation in US tariffs on data going back 200 years.\nThe Trump administration has so far brokered two trade agreements \u2014 with the United Kingdom and China \u2014 but the administration still has more than a hundred to go. Bilateral trade agreements typically take years of detailed discussions between countries, but Trump identified July 8 as his deadline to hash out deals with every US trading partner, before the massive tariff hikes he unveiled in early April go back into effect.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said Trump will likely delay his tariffs even more for countries that are actively negotiating with the administration.\nFor now, Fed officials are inclined to wait longer for some clarity, not just on tariffs, but also to see whether a brewing conflict in the Middle East spirals out of control.\nRelated live storyFed holds interest rate steady for fourth time in a row\nThe Israel-Iran conflict that erupted last week has escalated in recent days, with the United States mulling military involvement. The conflict has already resulted in surging global oil prices, which could translate into higher prices in the US if there continue to be disruptions to global energy supply. And even if energy prices in the US climb, it\u2019s a high bar for the Fed to go back to hiking interest rates.\nIn response to a question posed by CNN\u2019s Matt Egan, Powell said it\u2019s \u201cpossible that we\u2019ll see higher energy prices\u201d because of Israel-Iran conflict, but that \u201cthose things don\u2019t generally tend to have lasting effects on inflation.\u201d\n\u201cIn the 1970s\u2026 you got a series of very, very large shocks, but we haven\u2019t seen anything like that,\u201d Powell said. \u201cNow the US economy is far less dependent on foreign oil.\u201d\nFed officials are also keeping tabs on the president\u2019s tax and spending bill, currently being reviewed by the Senate. The provisions in the version of Trump\u2019s megabill that passed the House would would boost the economy 0.8% over about three decades \u2014 compared to its estimate of 1.7% for the 2017 bill, the right-leaning Tax Foundation estimates.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/18\/economy\/fed-rate-decision-june","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"How American consumers are feeling the squeeze, in 4 charts","date":"2025-06-01","body":"The lingering effects of high inflation coupled with high interest rates have made it harder in recent years for many Americans to get aheadfinancially.\nThehits just keep coming.\nAraft of policy movesfrom the Trump administration, including particularly steep tariffs that could cause prices to rise, and the whipsaw approach being taken, have stoked uncertainty and driven down sentiment to some of the lowest levels on record.\nThat combination of higher prices, uncertainty and pessimism can be outright noxious as pullbacks in consumer and business spending can have cascading negative effects on the labor market and the broader economy.\nThe consumers who power the US economywith their spendinghave been resilient to date \u2014 but they\u2019re being increasingly spread thin.\nDebt loads are climbing, as are defaults, and indicators of consumer strain are flashing red: For example, an increasing number of people are paying for their groceries in installments.\nAmong those feeling the biggest squeezeare student loan borrowerswho have been mired in confusion since the pandemic and amid two presidential administrations\u2019 opposing desires for those outstanding balances. The prospects of sharply reduced monthly payments and, especially, debt forgiveness have faded; instead, those who have fallen behind on payments not only are seeing their credit scores tank as a result, but they also risk having their wages garnished by the government.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at how household finances are becoming increasingly frayed:\nThe Covid-19 pandemic upended the US economy \u2014 but in the process, some Americans were able to swiftlypay down their debt and sock away money in savings.\nStimulus checks, payment pauses (on student loans and rents, in some cases), cutbacks in travel and other discretionary spending, as well asa $430 billion \u201crefinancing boom\u201dhelped give Americans plenty of dry powder and a leg up on their debts.\nThe shored-up savings helped to power a post-pandemic recovery, and credit card balances shot up accordingly.\nThe record-setting balances, on their own, weren\u2019t necessarily a troublesome indicator. Credit card use rises as the population grows, as more people shop online, and as the economy and wage gains remain strong.\nHowever, the post-pandemic recovery included a bout ofdecades-high inflationthat the Federal Reserve tried to combat withdecades-high interest rates.\nWhere the rubber meets the road is how people were managing those rising and costly debts.\nBy the end of last year, Americans were having greater difficulty in managing rising debt and, in some cases, hadn\u2019t been that overextended since the aftermath of the Great Recession.\nThe share of households becoming seriously delinquent on their auto loans and credit cardshit 14-year highs.\nMoreover, at the start of this year, it was highly expected that student loan delinquencies would worsen.\nThe 3.5-year payment pauseended in September 2023; however, an additional provision under the Biden administration provided a one-year \u201con-ramp\u201d where borrowers were shielded from the negative effects of a missed payment. That grace period ended September 30, 2024, and missed payments started hitting credit reports.\nStudent loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1% following the ending of a pandemic-era pause of reporting past-due loans on credit reports, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s first-quarter Household Debt and Credit Report.\n\u201cAdding student loans back into the mix certainly looks like it was a bridge too far for a lot of people, when it comes to their ability to pay the bills down,\u201d Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, said in a recent interview with CNN.\nAnd when the loans land into the serious delinquency territory (when they\u2019re late by 90 days or more), that\u2019s a major knock on people\u2019s ability to achieve other goals: Defaulted borrowers with credit scores above 620 saw average negative score changes north of 140 points, and those with scores north of 720 saw drops of 177 points on average, New York Fed research showed.\nIn addition to the credit score impacts, those who have defaulted on their federal student loans will likely see their wages garnished by the Department of Education.\n\u201cThe money that has to go to student loan payments now is money that can\u2019t go to paying off credit card debt or building an emergency fund or working toward other financial goals that build a stable foundation,\u201d Schulz said.\nBuy Now, Pay Later installment plans have become more widely available and adoption rates have increased as people of all ages \u2014 but especially younger adults \u2014 have grown more comfortable incorporating them into their shopping habits.\nAt their best, Buy Now, Pay Later loans can serve as an alternative to credit cards and are used by consumers who are seeking more flexible payment options, who want to overcome a tight financial spot, or who are looking to smooth out some bigger transactions to better meet their budgets.\nBut it\u2019s the\u201cat their worst\u201d partwhere there\u2019s greater cause for concern.\nBuy Now, Pay Later comes with such ease that people can quickly spend well beyond their means \u2014 especially if they start stacking multiple installment loans at the same time. A Bankrate survey conducted in May found that nearly half of all BNPL users experienced at least one problem, and overspending topped the list.\nThe assignment with audie cornishKlarna\u2019s CEO on why you should buy now, pay later\nIn recent months, however, it\u2019s what people have been buying with BNPL loans that have raised red flags among economists and analysts.\nOne in four BNPL users say the installment loans to buy groceries, according to surveys conducted in April and May by LendingTree. That\u2019s up from 14% from a year before.\nThere was aspike in these types of purchaseswhen inflation hit 40-year highs back in 2022.\n\u201cThose loans have traditionally been thought of for clothing andgaming consoles and furnitureand things like that,\u201d Schulz said. \u201cBut when people are using them for something as basic and fundamental as groceries, it is certainly concerning.\u201d\n\u201cThat hints that people are looking for whatever way they can to extend their budgets in the face of higher interest rates, higher prices at the grocery store and elsewhere, student loan repayments and just other economic headwinds people are facing,\u201d he added.\nThebuilding economic headwindsare weighing more heavily on Americans.\nConsumer sentimenthas been freefalling in recent months, and in Mayremained at a near-record low, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched indicator of how people are feeling about the economy.\nSince 1952, when the university started tracking how Americans felt about the economy, there have been nearly a dozen recessions, several oil price shocks, a few wars, a couple of inflationary episodes, a major financial crisis and a global pandemic.\nTurns out, a massive trade war nearly trumps all.\nTrump\u2019s sweeping and steep tariffs and other policy shifts have stoked recession fears and sent sentiment readings south every month this year. The university\u2019s index of consumer sentiment is down almost 30% since January.\nThe biggest concern for the economy is how people and businesses manage those sour feelings and to what extent they change behaviors.\nA pullback in spending and business investment could ultimately lead to a contraction in the economy and rising unemployment.\n\u201cIf [consumers are] watching the headlines to shape their sentiment, they\u2019re most likely feeling like deer in headlights \u2014 unable to move for fear the car may swerve at the last minute,\u201d Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet\u2019s senior economist, wrote in commentary on Friday. \u201cEconomic policy is in a state of near-constant flux, and with that, so too are consumer feelings about the economy.\u201d\nThe latest Commerce Department data, however, indicated that Americans\u2019 income growth wasstronger than expected in Apriland that people bolstered their savings accounts. That could ultimately help people guard against negative effects of the tariffs yet to come, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\u201cSolid income growth and a more elevated saving rate should help cushion households from the brunt of inflation\u2019s tariff-related increases in coming months, resulting in a second-half \u2018soft patch\u2019 for the economy rather than a bona fide recession,\u201d he wrote last week.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/01\/economy\/consumer-student-loans-debt-squeeze-dg","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The only problem: America\u2019s rate-setters don\u2019t report to him.\nTrump over the past week hasripped into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powellfor not lowering borrowing costs, threatening to fire him from what is an independent government agency. On Monday, Trump renewed his public pressure campaign against Powell, calling him a \u201cmajor loser.\u201d\nBut Trump\u2019s demands stand in stark contrast with the Fed\u2019s data-driven approach. Not only is inflation still higher than Fed officials want, but Trump\u2019s massive policy shifts threaten to send prices even higher.\n\u201cThe risks to inflation are more elevated than they were a year ago, so the consequence of that is we might have to hold policy tighter for longer than we had thought,\u201d San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Friday at an event hosted by the University of California, Berkeley.\nThe Fed, under Powell\u2019s leadership, has so far succeeded in tamping down the fastest inflation in more than 40 years without a recession, an exceptionally rare feat known as a \u201csoft landing.\u201d Even Republicans such as Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana have praised the Fed\u2019s staunch commitment to data.\nIn recent public speeches, several Fed officials have agreed that they can be patient before introducing a rate cut. Inflation is still above the Fed\u2019s 2% target and the job market remains in good shape, so there isn\u2019t a convincing case for the Fed to cut rates.\nTrump\u2019s broad and high tariffs have also injected uncertainty into the economy. Forecasters say America could be on a path toward significantly weaker growth and faster inflation \u2014 a toxic combination known as \u201cstagflation.\u201d\nBoston Fed President Susan Collins also echoed that sentiment recently, saying that \u201cI see monetary policy as well positioned to address a wide range of potential economic outcomes in this highly uncertain environment.\u201d\nTranslation: Interest rates can easily change in either direction, so it\u2019s best to stand pat, especially at such an uncertain moment, until the economic data says otherwise.\nWhen the economy is in trouble and unemployment starts to ratchet higher, the Fed typically steps in to stop the bleeding by cutting rates. But there isn\u2019t data showing economic instability or high unemployment.\nThe Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 has come down substantially since reaching a four-decade peak in June 2022. But it was still at an annual rate of 2.5% in February. The Fed\u2019s target is 2%.\nThe economy also remains on solid footing:Unemployment remains low, employers continue to add jobs at a solid pace, and consumer spending, which powers two-thirds of the US economy, has slowedbut it hasn\u2019t fallen off a cliff just yet.\n\u201cThe US economy is continuing to expand, but the pace of growth appears to have moderated,\u201d St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said on April 11 at an event in Hot Springs, Arkansas. \u201cThere is still more work to do to bring inflation back down to our 2% target.\u201d\nThe Fed operates independently from the White House, which means Powell and other Fed officials can set interest rates based on what they think is best rather than on short-term political considerations. That independence can be deeply reassuring to investors at times of heightened uncertainty \u2014 like now.\n\u201cFed independence is more important than ever at a time when there is risk to underlying inflation and inflation expectations from Trump tariff inflation,\u201d analysts at Evercore ISI wrote in an April 17 analyst note.\nAnd while Trump wants interest rate cuts, Fed officials have signaled they are fine at their current rate.\n\u201cThe stance of monetary policy is well positioned,\u201d Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said at an event in Dallas earlier this month.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/22\/economy\/federal-reserve-trump-interest-rates","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"European Central Bank cuts interest rates as tariffs threaten the economy","date":"2025-04-17","body":"The European Central Bank cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point Thursday, citing growing trade tensions after US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs sparked a global trade war.\nWhile the 20 countries that use the euro have built up \u201cresilience against global shocks,\u201d the \u201coutlook for (economic) growth has deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions,\u201d the ECB said in a statement.\nThe central bank is one of a number of global economic and financial players to warn that tariffs could weigh on economies and hurt everyone from major corporations to regular people. Similar warnings have been issued by theInternational Monetary Fund, theWorld Trade Organization,US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powellandothers.\nSpeaking to reporters, ECB President Christine Lagarde said: \u201cDisruptions to international commerce, financial market tensions and geopolitical uncertainty are weighing on business investment. As consumers become more cautious about the future, they may pull back on spending.\u201d\nThe ECB\u2019s rate cut to 2.25%, which was widely expected, is the seventh in the past year.\nYael\u202fSelfin, chief economist at consultancy KPMG, said the trade war \u2013 which has featured a flurry of tariffs, pauses, new tariffs and more delays \u2013 could lead to a pile-up of products as trade flows get snarled.\n\u201cThe outfall of the trade disruptions could create a global glut of manufactured goods, which could see goods prices fall into deflationary territory this year,\u201d Selfin added.\nIn contrast to the ECB, the US Federal Reserve held rates steady at its most recent policy meeting in March, and officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have hinted that trade uncertainty will keep rates on hold awhile longer.\nOn Wednesday, Powell told a Chicago audience that Trump\u2019s moves represent \u201cvery fundamental policy changes\u201d and gave his starkest warning to date on the effect of tariffs on the US economy, the world\u2019s largest.\nTrump contrasted the approach of the two central banks on social media Thursday, ripping into Powell for holding rates.\n\u201cJerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete \u2018mess!\u2019\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cPowell\u2019s termination cannot come fast enough!\u201d\nBut Lagarde, in her press conference Thursday, rallied behind Powell: \u201cI have a lot of respect for my esteemed colleague and friend Jay Powell.\u201d\nShe added that it is imperative that central banks stay independent of government influence or intervention, noting that any country that wants to join the eurozone must demonstrate that it can uphold that independence in law and in practice.\n\u201cFor us, here, the independence of central banks is fundamental,\u201d she said.\nThis story has been updated with additional information and context.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/17\/economy\/ecb-cuts-interest-rates-tariffs-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Key takeaways from the Fed\u2019s decision to pause interest rate cuts","date":"2025-01-29","body":"The Federal Reserve on Wednesdayhit pause on interest rate cutsin its first key decision ofPresident Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\nIt\u2019s a move that\u2019s likely to stoke tensions between the central bank and the new president, who has argued that he should have some say in Fed policy.\nCentral bank officials opted to keep borrowing costs at a range of between 4.25% and 4.5% as they await further progress on inflation, which showed signs of stalling out late last year. Fed officials reached that conclusion in their latest policy statement, omitting a phrase included in the previous statement that said inflation has \u201cmade progress.\u201d\nOfficials have said recently that they\u2019re still confident inflation will eventually reach their 2% target, but the central bank won\u2019t be able to declare victory anytime soon. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference that an unexpectedly weakening labor market or inflation slowing \u201cmore quickly than anticipated\u201d would put rate cuts back on the table.\n\u201cWe feel like we don\u2019t need to be in a hurry to make any adjustments,\u201d Powell said.\nRelated live storyFed hits pause on interest rate cuts amid Trump\u2019s flurry of economic plans\nEven though the Fed is mulling a holding pattern that would delay further rate cuts, the central bank\u2019s thinking on borrowing costs could shift if Trump keeps his promise of slapping25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, two of America\u2019s biggest trading partners, on February 1.\nEconomists are warning that Trump\u2019s stiff tariffs, if enacted, plus mass deportation policies and the focus on boosting domestic oil production, could end up further stoking inflation, undoing some of the progress the Fed has seen in recent years.\nFed officials have already begun to consider potential changes in trade policy when determining their outlook for the economy: \u201cWhat we can do is what we have done, which is study up on this and look at historical experience, read the literature,\u201d Powell said of tariffs. \u201cAnd we will have to see how it goes.\u201d\nMany investors still expect the Fed to continue cutting interest rates this year, with a few estimating no rate cuts at all in 2025. But every possibility remains on the table, including additional rate hikes.\nHere are key takeaways from the Fed\u2019s latest decision.\nPowell said he has no \u201cresponse or comment whatsoever\u201d on Trump\u2019s remarks last week during his speech at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.\nThe president said \u201cwith oil prices going down, I\u2019ll demand that interest rates drop immediately,\u201d then later that same day, he said \u201cI think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know it certainly much better than the one who\u2019s primarily in charge of making that decision,\u201d referencing Powell.\nOn whether Powell has had any communication with Trump since his inauguration, the Fed leader said he\u2019s had \u201cno contact.\u201d Trump last week said he\u2019ll speak with Powell \u201cat the right time.\u201d\nIn response to a reporter\u2019s question asking how the Fed will operate under political pressure, Powell said the Fed will remain committed to being independent and continue to base its interest rate decisions on economic data.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look for us to do anything else,\u201d he said.\nShortly after Powell finished taking questions from reporters, Trump blasted the Fed and its leader in a post on his platform Truth Social, claiming they \u201cfailed to stop the problem they created with inflation\u201d and that the central bank \u201chas done a terrible job on bank regulation.\u201d He added that his policies will come to the rescue, which include shoring up energy production and changing US trade relationships.\nPowell made it clear that fears over the job market have faded recently, echoing officials\u2019 statement which said that conditions are \u201csolid.\u201d The latest economic figures show that to be the case with unemployment at a low 4.1% and employers continuing to hire at a brisk pace.\nYet, the Fed chief agreed that it has become difficult for workers to find a job these days, saying that \u201cit\u2019s a low-hiring environment.\u201d\nPowell said the Fed has adopted a wait-and-see approach on the possible changes for trade policy, stressing that there are still many key unknowns.\n\u201cThe range of possibilities is very, very wide,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what is going to be a tariff; we don\u2019t know for how long, how much, what countries, and we don\u2019t know about retaliation or how it will transmit through the economy to consumers.\u201d\nTrump has promised big changes in economic policy: In addition to the massive tariffs he\u2019s floated, Trump has also called for deregulation and extending his 2017 tax cuts \u2014 policies that economists describe as \u201cexpansionary.\u201d That means they would likely boost economic growth, increasing the risk of a spike in inflation.\nRelated articleTrump just gave his clearest picture yet of what new tariffs could look like\nTrump\u2019s ongoing crackdown on immigration could also have a massive impact on the labor market and the broader economy. Powell said it\u2019s clear that would have an effect on employers that rely on migrant workers.\nPut together, the new administration\u2019s policies introduce some uncertainty because it\u2019s not clear how the economy will ultimately respond to Trump\u2019s shock therapy. Powell in his presser said uncertainty is simply a fact of life.\nThe Fed is tasked with making sense of this new economic landscape. Central bank officials frequently stress that their decisions are data dependent, and avoid commenting on fiscal policy. Powell has said the Fed considers fiscal policy as as given, adjusting monetary policy accordingly.\nIn late 2018 after the first Trump administration went on a tariff spree, the Fed devised multiple simulations to determine the best path for policy under different tariff scenarios, according to a declassified documents detailing policy alternatives known as the \u201ctealbook.\u201d In most scenarios, the Fed saw it appropriate to \u201csee through\u201d any tariff increases, considering that one-time tariff hikes usually translate to one-time price adjustments.\nBut in a scenario in which foreign countries enacted retaliatory tariffs and inflation expectations climbed, the Fed judged it appropriate to hike rates.\nRecent consumer surveys have shown an uptick in year-ahead inflation expectations, though Powell told reporters that expectations remain in check. He added that the recent increase was likely due to the speculation over the policies of the Trump administration, which could jack up prices.\nFor now, investors are betting that the Fed will also hold borrowing costs steady in March, though that expectation could change if future figures show that inflation slowed sharply in January and February.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/29\/economy\/fed-rate-decision-january","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Japan raises interest rates to highest level in 17 years","date":"2025-01-24","body":"The Bank of Japan raised interest rates on Friday to their highest since the 2008 global financial crisis, underscoring its confidence that rising wages will keep inflation stable around its 2% target.\nThe decision marks its first rate hike since July last year and comes days after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, who is likely to keep global policymakers vigilant ahead of potential repercussions from threatened higher tariffs.\nAt its two-day meeting concluding on Friday, the BOJ raised its short-term policy rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, a level Japan has not seen in 17 years. It was made in a 8 to 1 vote with board member Toyoaki Nakamura dissenting.\nThe widely expected move underscores the central bank\u2019s resolve to steadily push up interest rates to around 1%, a level analysts see as neither cooling nor overheating Japan\u2019s economy.\n\u201cThe likelihood of achieving the BOJ\u2019s outlook has been rising,\u201d with many firms saying they will continue to raise wages steadily in this year\u2019s annual wage negotiations, the central bank said in a statement announcing the decision.\n\u201cUnderlying inflation is heightening towards the BOJ\u2019s 2% target,\u201d the central bank said, adding that financial markets remain stable as a whole.\nThe BOJ made no change to its guidance on future policy, saying that it will continue to raise interest rates if its economic and price forecasts are realized. But it removed a phrase stressing the need to scrutinize risks surrounding overseas economies and markets.\n\u201cTheir logic remains the same. They are still far away from neutral, so it\u2019s natural to make an adjustment,\u201d said Naka Matsuzawa, chief macro strategist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo.\n\u201cUnless the BOJ either changes the logic of rate hikes, or even raises the neutral point, which they have been mulling \u2013 about 1% \u2013 there\u2019s not going to much room for the market to price in further hikes in the future.\u201d\nThe yen rose around 0.5% to 155.32 per dollar after the decision, while the two-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield rose to 0.705%, the highest since October 2008.\nAttention now shifts to any clues from BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda in his post-meeting briefing at 0630 GMT on the pace and timing of further increases.\nIn a quarterly outlook report, the board raised its price forecasts to project core inflation moving at or above its 2% target for three straight years.\nIt also said risks to the inflation outlook were skewed to the upside amid intensifying labor shortages, rising prices of rice and the boost to import costs from a weak yen.\n\u201cWith regards to this year\u2019s annual wage negotiations, there have been many views expressed by firms that they will continue to raise wages steadily,\u201d the report said.\nThe head of Japan\u2019s union umbrella group told Reuters on Friday that Japanese annual pay increases must exceed the 5.1% secured last year as real wages continue to fall.\nThe board now projects core consumer inflation to hit 2.4% in fiscal 2025 before slowing to 2.0% in 2026. In the previous projection made in October, it expected inflation to hit 1.9% in both fiscal 2025 and 2026.\nIt made no change to its forecasts that Japan\u2019s economy will grow 1.1% in fiscal 2025 and 1.0% in 2026.\nWhile the US economy has been solid and financial markets stable as a whole, the BOJ must be vigilant to uncertainties surrounding US policy conduct, the report said.\n\u201cThe hike may have been expected but in what feels like the first time in a very long time, there were no major downgrades to their economic outlook,\u201d said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index in Brisbane. \u201cThis keeps the door open to another 25 (basis points) hike by the year-end, and rates to sit at a whopping 0.75%.\u201d\nJapan\u2019s core consumer inflation accelerated to 3.0% in December, the fastest annual pace in 16 months, data showed earlier on Friday, in a sign rising fuel and food prices continue to push up living costs for households.\nAfter taking the helm in April 2023, Ueda dismantled his predecessor\u2019s radical stimulus program in March last year and pushed up short-term interest rates to 0.25% in July.\nBOJ policymakers have repeatedly said the central bank will keep raising rates, if Japan makes progress in achieving a cycle in which rising inflation boosts wages and lifts consumption, thereby allowing firms to continue passing on higher costs.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/24\/business\/japan-interest-rates-hike-hnk-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"We\u2019re in a \u2018windchill\u2019 economy, where things feel worse than they are","date":"2025-12-09","body":"Most Americans agree: Thiseconomy stinks.\nPractically every consumer sentiment survey and political poll points to that theme. People feel like their dollars aren\u2019t stretching as far as before, and the cost of living is rising beyond their means.\nThere\u2019s just one problem: That part is not true.\nMost Americans are getting raises that outpace overall inflation. It\u2019s not even a new trend. It\u2019s been happening each month since June 2023.\nSo, why do people feel so lousy about their finances if they\u2019re getting wealthier?\nA number of key factors are at play, and most of them are messing with our minds more than our wallets.\nSo this is the windchill economy: It feelsworse than it actually is. For many Americans, it\u2019s deeply unpleasant.\nThe inflation crisis took a substantial toll on Americans\u2019 wallets. Between March 2021 and June 2023, inflation outpaced paycheck growth \u2013 at times by a historic margin.\nBut the trend started to reverse in mid-2023, and folks have been making out better since then. Their raises started to outpace price hikes, and paychecks have fattened across all income groups \u2013 not just top earners.\nThat gap started to widen substantially toward the end of former President Joe Biden\u2019s term and reached its most recent peak in April 2025, when paychecks grew 4.1% over the course of the previous 12 months, while prices rose just 2.3% over the same period.\nBut the gap has shrunk considerably over the past several months. Inflation stood at 3% in September, while wage gains came in at 3.8%. Median income for working-age Americans slowed near decade-long lows this year when adjusting for inflation,JPMorgan reported.\nEven though American workers are still ahead, they can see inflation creeping ever closer in the rearview mirror. The overall feeling that dollars aren\u2019t stretching quite as far as they used to isn\u2019t quite backed up in the data, but it\u2019s starting to feel that way as prices are on the rise again.\nDuring the pandemic, millions of Americans got their first taste of financial security. They weren\u2019t spending on travel, gas, restaurants and a number of other items. Their savings were padded by what they weren\u2019t spending \u2013 and Americans got an additional boost through historic government stimulus.\nPay exceeded inflation by record margins: In May 2020, average wages grew 7.5% over the previous 12 months, when inflation stood at just 0.1%. For a year, Americans gained substantial purchasing power. \u201cRevenge spending\u201d became a social media trend, and consumer confidence surged.\nWith ample savings and hefty raises, folks expected that they would make enough money to achieve the American Dream. But when the pandemic shifted into an inflation crisis, Americans discovered that the game had changed.\nThe housing market locked up, and the last bastions of cheap housing in America are gone: Boomers weren\u2019t downsizing, starter homes were going for hundreds of thousands of dollars over asking price, million-dollar homes in middle-class towns became commonplace, and mortgage rates started to rise.\nThe wage-inflation calculus flipped, and during inflation\u2019s peak in June 2022, prices rose 9.1% over the course of the previous 12 months \u2013 a four-decade high \u2013 wages grew only 4.8%.\nThe good vibes wore off \u2013 quickly. Robust spending growth that had carried into 2023 fell off a cliff and is now just treading water.\n\u201cPeople across the income spectrum were spending; they were living a pretty good life,\u201d said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \u201cAnd then you can see the straight decline for the bottom 80% for the vast majority of America.\u201d\nThe financial security many Americans thought they could achieve feels even more distant than before they got their raises several years ago.\nEven though pay gains are exceeding overall inflation, the particular prices that are gaining fastest are among the most painful for Americans to absorb.\nFood, electricity, child care, home prices and rent have all outpaced wage gains over the course of the \u201920s. Those items all have a common theme: They\u2019re regular expenses that you can\u2019t avoid.\nAmericans\u2019 wages have gained 29% this decade. But grocery prices and child care both rose 30% over the past five years. Electricity is up 38%. Rent is up 30% and home prices have surged 55%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nYou can decide not to buy a new TV or go on a trip. You can rein in your holiday spending \u2013 andmany Americans have. But if the necessities are getting more expensive, that stings even more.\nJust as prices are not all created equal, financial situations are wildly different, too. For wealthier Americans who have money in the booming stock market and equity in their home, they\u2019ve gained significant financial security over the past few years. That\u2019s not true for lower-income Americans, a rapidly growing share of whom are living paycheck to paycheck.\nBank of America\u2019s deposit data illustrates that divide: Higher-income households\u2019 paychecks grew 4% year-over-year in November \u2014 the highest since October 2021 and well above the 3% inflation rate. But middle-income households\u2019 paychecks gained just 2.3% and lower-income households\u2019 wages were up only 1.4% \u2013 half the pace of inflation.\nAlthough Bank of America\u2019s data hasn\u2019t yet shown up in broader economic data, there\u2019s ample evidence that lower-income Americans are struggling. Multiple prominent retailers that cater to middle-class and low-income Americans have said customers are visiting less and spending fewer dollars when they shop. That trend continued during the beginning of the holiday shopping season.\nBut Walmart and Costco, which appeal to middle-class Americans looking for value, are surging.\n\u201cThis is the Costco economy,\u201d said Long. \u201cPeople need to save.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/09\/economy\/affordability-economy-windchill","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Mortgage rates climb above 7% to highest level since May","date":"2025-01-16","body":"Mortgage rates topped 7% this week, a key psychological threshold, in a sign of the US housing market\u2019s unrelenting affordability challenges.\nThe average rate on a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage was 7.04% in the week ending January 16, according to a survey of lenders released Thursday by Freddie Mac. It\u2019s the fifth consecutive weekly increase and the highest level since May.\nMortgage rates this week were nearly a full percentage point higher than in late September, when the Federal Reservebegan to cut interest rates. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which influences mortgage rates, ratcheted higher over the past several weeks on signs of stubborn inflation, but tumbled Wednesday after the latest Consumer Price Index showed progress isback on track.\nThe Fed has signaled only two rate cuts this year, which may not come until later in the year, according to Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\nIn addition to elevated borrowing costs, homebuyers are also contending with home prices that are hovering around all-time highs; and in some regions, surging home insurance premiums.\nBuyers could be stuck waiting a while for any meaningful relief: Economists do not expect the housing marketto improve much this yearas mortgage rates will likely remainabove 6% through 2026.That dashes any hopes of homeownership for first-time buyers and low-income households living in metropolitan areas seeing rapid home-price growth such as New York and San Diego.\n\u201cThe underlying strength of the economy is contributing to this increase in rates. Despite rising rates, Freddie Mac research highlights that consumers can save money if they shop for several different lender quotes,\u201d said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, in a release.\nFor decades, demand for housing has outstripped supply nationwide. Freddie Mac estimates there is a housing shortage of 3.7 million units.\n\u201cWe have an affordability crisis, a housing shortage and for the first time in my lifetime, parents feel the American dream is slipping away from their children,\u201d Scott Bessent, whom President-elect Donald Trump nominated to be his Treasury secretary, said during his confirmation hearing Thursday on Capitol Hill.\nRelated live storySenators hold confirmation hearings for Trump Cabinet picks\nHowever, there weresome welcome improvements on that frontlast year. Total housing inventory increased throughout most of 2024, according to data from the National Association of Realtors, registering at 1.33 million units in the end of November, up 17.7% from a year earlier.\nSome homeowners who had locked in a low mortgage rate before the Fed began to hike interest rates in 2022 have finally thrown in the towel and decided to sell, despite the fact that their new mortgage rate will be higher. That has contributed to the uptick in housing inventory. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun has said life events such as marriage, divorce and new children eventually force homeowners to sell.\nBut that phenomenon \u2014 known as the lock-in effect \u2014 might not come undone a whole lot this year, according to economists. That means persistent housing shortages could continue to push up prices. To make matters worse, persistently elevated borrowing costs could also pump the brakes on the pace of home construction.\nOwning a home has become a pipe dream for Jeff Howard, a 35-year-old renter living in Atlanta. Not only has Howard struggled to find a job after obtaining a master\u2019s degree in health care administration in 2019, but he has also maxed out all his credit cards, making homeownership a far-fetched financial goal.\nWaiting on the sidelines has proven to be Howard\u2019s best option.\n\u201cI\u2019m just watching the news on what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates and just waiting for the housing market to burst open,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee owning a house anywhere in the near or medium term.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/16\/economy\/mortgage-rates-7-percent","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"A first look at November hiring shows the private sector lost 32,000 jobs","date":"2025-12-03","body":"Small businesses are starting to crack amid a weakening economy, rising costs and fickle consumers; and they drove job losses in the US private sector in November, payroll giant ADP reported Wednesday.\nADP\u2019s latest monthly look at private-sector employment showed that about 32,000 jobs were lost last month, marking a drop-off from the upwardly revised 47,000 jobs gained in October.\nADP\u2019s reports have gained in prominence in recent weeks as the longest shutdown in US historystifled statistical agencies\u2019 abilities to collect, analyze and release economic data.\nThe November jobs report, originally slated for release on Friday, isdelayed until December 16. It also will include partial data from October, a month where a full jobs report was nixed.\nAs such, Wednesday ADP data is likely the next-best estimate on the labor market Federal Reserve officials will get before their policymaking meeting next week.\nStill, while ADP\u2019s tabulations don\u2019t often correlate with theofficial jobs numbers, they\u2019re looked to as an indicator of hiring and wage growth activity.\nAnd in recent months, that trajectory hasn\u2019t been great.\nConsumer confidence falls to lowest in seven months as concerns grow about the economy\nPrivate employers have shed jobs in four of the past six months, ADP data shows. The net loss of 32,000 reported for November is the largest monthly drop in two and a half years.\n\u201cThe (ADP) report shows the job market is losing more momentum at year-end and skews risks toward modestly higher unemployment early next year,\u201d Oren Klachkin, Nationwide\u2019s financial markets economist, wrote in a note Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a high level of disagreement among Fed policymakers right now, but we maintain our call the doves will prevail over the hawks and the FOMC to vote for another [quarter-point] interest rate reduction at next week\u2019s meeting.\u201d\nThe estimated job losses reported for November were overwhelmingly at small establishments (classified as having between one and 49 employees), which shed an estimated 120,000 jobs last month. Medium and large businesses added 51,000 jobs and 39,000 jobs, respectively.\n\u201cWhen you look historically, the labor market is not weak, but it is weakening \u2014 and the first to crack are small establishments,\u201d Nela Richardson, ADP\u2019s chief economist, said Wednesday in a call with reporters. \u201cI see them as a canary in the coal mine. Things could shift, but small firms are the leading indicator.\u201d\nIt\u2019s possible that the steep losses at small businesses could be tied to spillover effects from theUS government shutdown, which lasted from October 1 to November 12, she said.\nHowever, the estimated labor force cutbacks are likely more a reflection of small businesses trying to weather an uncertain economic environment and an increasingly cautious consumer, she said.\n\u201cYou can see that there are a lot of different angles of concern for the smallest firms: It\u2019s about supply, it\u2019s about high price levels,\u201d she said Wednesday. \u201cEven if you think that inflation is declining or moderate or any tariff impact is transitory, if you look at cumulative price increases over the last five years, it\u2019s up around 25%.\u201d\nAnd when small businesses don\u2019t have the wiggle room to navigate higher prices \u2013 notably the ability toabsorb cost increasesfromfrequently shifting tariffs\u2013 they often shift their hiring patterns to help offset rising costs, she added.\nBusinesses are likely staying lean \u2013 delaying hiring, not replacing workers \u2013 versus making outright layoffs, so that they can weather an uncertain economic environment, she said.\n\u201cAnd all of that is adding up to job losses on a national level,\u201d she said.\nThat low-hire, low-fire activity has been heavily supported by other economic data, specifically claims for unemployment benefits. First-time claims have remained fairly stable while continuing claims (those filed by people who have received a week or more in jobless benefits) have been butting up against four-year highs.\nBy industry, the losses were more broad-based, with some of the deeper drops in industries such as professional and business services, information and manufacturing.\nEconomists were expecting that 40,000 jobs would be added, according to FactSet.\nADP\u2019s estimates are drawn from anonymized and aggregated payroll data from its clients.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/03\/economy\/us-adp-private-jobs-report-november","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Layoff announcements surged last month: The worst October in 22 years","date":"2025-11-06","body":"Company announcements of layoffs in the United States surged in October as AI continued to disrupt the labor market.\nAnnounced job cuts last month climbed by more than 153,000, according to a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday, up 175% from the same month a year earlier and the highest October increase since 2003. Layoff announcements surpassed more than a million in first 10 months of this year, an increase of 65% compared to the same period last year.\n\u201cThis is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008. Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,\u201d the report said.\nThe outplacement and executive coaching firm said America\u2019s labor market continued to normalize after a pandemic-era boom, but also cited \u201cAI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs\u201d as key factors putting companies under pressure.\nIndeed, major companies such as Amazon and Targethave announced major layoffsin recent months, with several of them citing AI. However, announcements of layoffs don\u2019t immediately translate to higher unemployment.\nThe government shutdown is now the longest - and likely the most damaging in US history\nIt\u2019s also been complicated to assess the labor market\u2019s health because of the government shutdown, which has now become the longest on record: Official economic statistics have been suspended since the beginning of October, including the Labor Department\u2019s closely watched employment report, which includes the unemployment rate and monthly payroll growth numbers.\nThe September jobs report, which was scheduled for October 3, hasn\u2019t been released and there will not be an October jobs report this month; it was originally scheduled for Friday. That has made it difficult for economic policymakers, such as Federal Reserve officials, to make important decisions.\nInvestors and policymakers now look to alternative data, such as Wednesday\u2019s private-sectorpayroll data from ADP, along with the Challenger report, to understand the state of the US economy.\nBut, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference last month, private data cannot replace government figures, which are widely known as the \u201cgold standard\u201d of measuring the world\u2019s largest economy. And the persistent absence of those figures could derail monetary policymaking and put future rate cuts at risk.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious,\u201d Powell said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/06\/economy\/job-layoff-announcements-challenger","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The government shutdown is now the longest - and likely the most damaging in US history","date":"2025-11-05","body":"The ongoing government shutdown isn\u2019t just the longest in American history. It\u2019s likely the most damaging, too.\nHistorically, the economic damage from shutdowns is fleeting, quickly reversing when the government reopens. However, the 36-day lapse in funding that began on October 1 is already dealing a significant \u2013 albeit temporary \u2013 blow to the world\u2019s largest economy.\nMillions of Americans arenot getting food stamp benefitsneeded to feed their families. Roughly 1.4 million federal employeeshaven\u2019t been paid\u2013 even though many are still working. And investors and policymakers arein the dark about what\u2019s happeningin the US economy because the release of government data has stalled.\n\u201cThe current shutdown looks likely to have the greatest economic impact of any shutdown on record,\u201d Alec Phillips, chief political economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.\nAs the shutdown drags on, here\u2019s how it can drag down the economy\nEven if the shutdown ends by next week, it will likely slow down the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 the broadest measure of economic output, without considering inflation \u2014 by 1.15 percentage points during the fourth quarter, according to Goldman Sachs.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the shutdown will reduce GDP by one to two percentage points.\n\u201cThose effects will intensify the longer the shutdown lasts,\u201d the CBO wrote in aletterlast week.\nAlthough \u201cmost of that decline\u201d will eventually be recovered, CBO estimates between $7 billion and $14 billion will be permanently lost during the shutdown.\nGoldman Sachs is now penciling in weaker fourth-quarter GDP growth of just 1%. That would represent a significant slowdown from the 3%or even 4% growththat was projected for the third quarter.\nPhillips wrote that the current shutdown is expected to result in a \u201cmuch greater hit to growth than any prior shutdown\u201d because it\u2019s the longest on record and is much broader than previous shutdowns.\nThe 2018-2019 shutdown, previously the longest on record at 35 days, was only a partial shutdown, impacting just 10% of government spending, according to Goldman Sachs. The 2025 shutdown, by comparison, has derailed 100% of appropriations.\nThe current shutdown also comes at a bad time, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management: \u201cThe economy was already going to slow down, and this just made it worse.\u201d\nKelly cited a range of factors slowing the economy in the fourth quarter, including historically high tariffs, low immigration and the return of student debt payments.\nHe added that it\u2019s \u201cshocking\u201d to see \u201chow much public pain (Democrats and Republicans) are willing to inflict just to get a political gain.\u201d\nThe precise economic damage from the shutdown is difficult to measure, in part because of the information blackout caused by the shutdown itself.\n\u201cWe are flying blind in this economy,\u201d Kelly said.\nOnly one major economic report has been released by the federal government during the shutdown: the Septemberconsumer price index(CPI), thefinal piece of data requiredto determine annual cost of living adjustments for Social Security benefits.\nOther data releases, including the all-important monthly jobs report and the Fed\u2019s go-to inflation metric as well as key insights on consumer spending, have been sidelined.\nThat\u2019s a major shift from the 2018-2019 shutdown, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics still received funding. That allowed the agency to continue collecting and releasing key economic data.\nPolicymakers have been forced to make decisions with limited information. Last week, for the first time ever, the Federal Reservedecided on interest rates without the monthly jobs report.\nThe shutdown is complicating the Fed\u2019s ability to help the economy\nIf the government shutdown continues to limit Fed officials\u2019 visibility, it could persuade the central bank to forgo cutting rates at the December policy meeting.\n\u201cWhat do you do if you\u2019re driving in the fog? You slow down,\u201d Fed ChairJerome Powell saidduring a press conference last week. \u201cI\u2019m not committing to that, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s certainly a possible that you would say, \u2018We really can\u2019t see, so let\u2019s slow down.\u2019\u201d\nEven after the government reopens, the quality of economic data could be eroded by the fact the BLS was unable to conduct critical surveys of businesses and consumers during the shutdown period.\nThe shutdown will also likely inflate the unemployment rate for the month of October because the BLS typically counts furloughed workers as unemployed unless they find work elsewhere.\nHow to help SNAP recipients as the shutdown drags on\nThe good news is most of the shutdown-induced damage to the economy is expected to quickly unwind after the government reopens.\nGoldman Sachs expects the shutdown effect to \u201cmore than reverse\u201d in the first quarter, boosting GDP by 1.3 percentage points as furloughed workers return and delayed federal spending recovers. The bank expects that reversal to lift first-quarter GDP growth to a solid pace of 3.1%.\nThe CBO estimated that some of the output lost due to employee furloughs would be permanently lost, costing the economy up to 14 billion in an eight-week shutdown.\nOf course, those forecasts for a rebound hinge on a key element of shutdowns: Federal workers are repaid once the government reopens.\nHowever, President Donald Trump has questioned the policy of paying furloughed workers \u2013 despite signing a law during his first term that has been widely interpreted as guaranteeing back pay for furloughed workers.\nThe White House on Tuesdaywould not commit to paying furloughed workersat the end of the shutdown, raising the risk of lasting economic damage.\nCNN\u2019s Tami Luhby contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/05\/economy\/government-shutdown-economy-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Big Tech keeps splurging on AI. The pressure is ramping up to show why","date":"2025-10-31","body":"Silicon Valley\u2019s mega AI spending spree isn\u2019t slowing down anytime soon. But Wall Street\u2019s patience to see a return might be wearing a little thin.\nThat message rang clear when Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet all said this week that they\u2019re forking over moreon capital expenditures, likeleases and equipment for data centers and infrastructure.\nBased on the way analysts grilled executives from companies like Meta, Alphabet and Google on earnings calls this week, they\u2019re eager for signs that these massive investments will pay off in a big way.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all grew their overall revenue year-over-year and surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Microsoft and Google saw their cloud businesses expand by 40% and 34% respectively, while Amazon Web Services sales grew 20% year-over-year \u2013 a sign that companies are indeed relying on their services in the age of AI.\nAnd they\u2019re continuing to pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and data centers, an investment they call necessary for the internet\u2019s next era.\nThe dollar amounts involved are staggering.\nGoogle expects tospend $91 to $93 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, up from the $85 billion it previously forecast. Microsoft sees that spendingup 74%, to $34.9 billion this year, largely lining up with the more than $30 billion it predicted for the quarter. Meta spent $19.37 billion, up from $9.2 billion a year ago and more than the $18.4 billion analysts expected.\nAnd Amazon estimates the 2025 bill will hit $125 billion \u2013 andexpects to increase that in 2026.\nEven Apple, which is not a major cloud provider, expects to increase its capital expenditure spending related to AI investments, Apple Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh said on the company\u2019s Thursday earnings call.\nExisting data centers need to be upgraded to handle AI workloads, leading to the giant outlays, said Melissa Otto, head of research for investment research service S&P Global Visible Alpha.\nTech giants justify that spending by saying demand is outstripping supply. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that \u201cas fast as we\u2019re adding capacity right now, we\u2019re monetizing it.\u201d\nBut Wall Street wants more than just promises of future returns. Meta shares fell as much as 13.5% on Thursday, while Microsoft\u2019s were down more than 3%.\nNearly every question on Meta\u2019s earnings call focused on how the company views its AI investments translating into income, the timeline for new products and models coming out of its Superintelligence Lab and its general approach to AI.\nZuckerberg called AI useful for powering virtual assistants and helping advertisers plan their campaigns. More than a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis, he said, adding that AI can lead to \u201call kinds of new products around different content formats.\u201d\n\u201cWe expect to build novel models and novel products, and I\u2019m excited to share more when we have it,\u201d he said about the Superintelligence Lab\u2019s efforts.\nOn the Microsoft call, analysts wanted to know if clients will make good on promised purchasing commitments and whether the tech industry can really make money from global AI investments. Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, said its investments reflect business that\u2019s already been booked, saying that demand is increasing.\nGoogle investors wanted to know how AI summaries and agents are changing how the company makes money from search. Google\u2019s chief business officer said the company makes about the same money from adsbelow and within the AI responses as with traditional search.\nThe answers satisfied some analysts; UBS said it maintains its \u201cconviction that AI-related stocks should drive further equity performance,\u201d while CFRA Research said it came away from the quarter \u201cmore optimistic\u201d about Google\u2019s core business and that Meta \u201cremains committed to becoming the leading AI lab.\u201d Wedbush Securities\u2019 Dan Ives said Microsoft is \u201chitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s as long as they keep growing the products that catapulted them to become the world\u2019s largest tech companies in the first place. Investors are more likely to raise their eyebrows at all this spending if customers start shying away from Meta\u2019s social media apps or Google\u2019s search engine, according to Otto.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a pressure to accelerate innovation,\u201d said SuRo Capital\u2019s Evan Schlossman. \u201cYou have new space in AI that people believe will be extremely valuable, and so there is a rush to sort of fill that void.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/31\/tech\/microsoft-amazon-meta-google-earnings-ai","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Why Jamie Dimon is warning of \u2018cockroaches\u2019 in the US economy","date":"2025-10-16","body":"Many Americans shrugged off the implosion of a pair of overleveraged Bear Stearns hedge funds in 2007. Stocks were at record highs, after all. But later it became apparent that those bankruptcies were among the first shoes to drop in an epic financial meltdown that would impact virtually all Americans.\nWall Street CEO Jamie Dimon rescuedBear Stearns when it nearly collapsed in 2008. Today, he cautions that trouble could be lurking again beneath the red-hot markets.\nFirst, a subprimeauto lender and dealer went bustlast month in a crash fueled by plenty of risky loans and,allegedly, \u201cpervasive fraud\u201d of \u201cextraordinary proportion,\u201d a lawyer said in court.\nThen First Brands, an auto-parts supplier built on complex and hidden loans,blinded Wall Streetwith a bankruptcy that financial firms are highly exposed to.\n\u201cMy antenna goes up when things like that happen,\u201d Dimon told analysts during a call on Tuesday. \u201cAnd I probably shouldn\u2019t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more\u2026 Everyone should be forewarned on this.\u201d\nIt\u2019s entirely possible the recent bankruptcies were fueled by company-specific problems, not systemic issues. And yet, as the 2008 financial crisis showed, trouble on Main Street can start in obscure corners of Wall Street.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s going on now.\nSubprime loans were at the heart of Bear Stearns\u2019 demise. The focus today is not on toxic mortgages but on subprime auto loans.\nTricolor Holdings, a Dallas-based auto lender specializing in loans to borrowers with weak credit scores, went bankrupt in September.\nThe bankruptcy shines a spotlight on how millions of Americans are hurting from the high cost of living and sluggish job market. Cars aremore expensive than ever, and more and more people arefalling behind on their car loans.\nEven JPMorgan, which prides itself on what Dimon has dubbed a \u201cfortress balance sheet,\u201d suffered $170 million in losses linked to the Tricolor bankruptcy, according to the company\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday.\nJust a few weeks later, First Brands, a privately owned auto-parts supplier, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The heart of its demise appears to be an opaque borrowing scheme, which the Department of Justice has reportedly opened acriminal investigationinto.\nFirst Brands turned to the private credit market for help acquiring competitors. In a recent court filing, newly appointed directors of First Brands revealed as much as $2.3 billion in unpaid loans. They refer to this as \u201coff-balance sheet financing\u201d because the company borrowed money without officially disclosing it on the books.\nCreditors allege First Brands got access to the funds by promising repayments when one of its customers paid their outstanding balance. This so-called third-party factoring is quite common. But creditors allege that First Brands essentially used the same invoice multiple times to access funds from private lenders unaware of the double dipping.\nEventually, lenders believed they were overleveraged and started asking questions.\nThe situation shares many similarities with investment bankLehman Brothers, which went under during the Great Recession after it used an accounting scheme to conceal how debt-reliant it was.\nFirst Brands declined to comment, instead referring CNN to a late Septembermotionfiled by Charles Moore, who became the company\u2019s chief restructuring officer when it filed for bankruptcy. This week, Moore became interim CEO after Patrick James resigned from the position.\nFor the past few years, the economy has been on solid footing. Hiring has been strong, unemployment has stayed low, and consumers have kept on spending. But thetide is starting to turn, in part because President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have put increasing stress has on American businesses.\nDimon warned analysts on Tuesday\u2019s call that risky portfolios such as those as Tricolor and First Brands will only become more apparent at similarly structured companies in a downturn.\nIt could be coincidence that First Brands and Tricolor\u2019s underlying financial issues are coming to light at almost the same time.\nBut as Warren Buffett famously said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know who\u2019s been swimming naked until the tide goes out.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/16\/business\/jamie-dimon-us-economy-cockroaches","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s China trade breakthrough might be enough to avoid self-inflicted recession","date":"2025-05-12","body":"President Donald Trump marched the US economy to the brink of a self-inflicted recession and a potential supply chain meltdown.\nBut at the last moment, Trump decided to pull back.\nTheUS-China breakthroughunveiled Monday calls for a90-day thaw in the trade warby slashing tariffs from suffocatinglyhigh levels as trade was paralyzed between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.\nThe dramatic drop in US-China tariffs is an undeniable positive compared to just a few days ago. The breakthrough has already set off anepic party on Wall Streetand is raising hopes that a tariff-driven nightmare can be avoided.\nYet economists say it\u2019s still too early to declare the US economy is out of danger altogether. Recession risks remain, even if the odds of a downturn have been dialed back a notch.\nTariffs are still very high \u2014 much higher than at any point in decades. Uncertainty is even higher. Damage to confidence and trade flows won\u2019t be undone overnight.\nMoreover, there is no playbook for what happens next. There is no precedent for how a modern economy responds after going through this many shocks in this short a time.\n\u201cWe are far from out of the woods,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and a former economic adviser to Republicans. \u201cThere is a narrative that Trump did a U-turn. He didn\u2019t. We still have tariffs at levels we haven\u2019t seen in a century. That\u2019s a substantial tax increase.\u201d\nAt 145%, US tariffs on China were unsustainably high, amounting to an effective embargo on trade. Supply chain experts warned of imminent trouble,including empty store shelves.\n\u201cThis staves off the really disastrous consequences that were about to hit the US economy,\u201d Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, told CNN.\nYork added that Trump\u2019s economic team backtracking from the 145% tariff rates \u201cshows the administration realizes what a disaster it would have been.\u201d\nEven though Trump has repeatedly offered a dose of tough medicine in recent weeks, including questioninghow many dolls kids needto own, he has been sensitive to the image of barren store shelves as well as financial market reaction to a deepening trade war, a senior administration official told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny.\n\u201cBoth sides luckily decided to save Christmas,\u201d Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in a report on Monday. \u201cThe US side listened to the existential crisis of many small businesses.\u201d\nStill, despite Trump\u2019s decision to slash tariffs on China to 30% for at least 90 days, import taxes remain sharply higher than at the start of the year.\nBased on the trade framework agreements reached with Chinaand the UK, Moody\u2019s Analytics calculates the US effective tariff rate has dropped from 21.3% to 13.7%. That\u2019s still the highest level since 1910.\nAt that level, tariffs are set to add more than one percentage point to US inflation through this time next year and erase the same amount from gross domestic product (GDP), Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told CNN.\nAs a result of the US-China trade war thaw, Zandi is cutting his recession forecast \u2014 but not dramatically. He now sees a 45% chance of a US recession this year, down from a peak of 60%.\n\u201cThe economy will have a tough year but should avoid a recession,\u201d Zandi said in an email. \u201cOf course, the economy will be highly vulnerable to anything else that might go wrong.\u201d\nIn other words, the trade war has eroded the margin for error in this economy.\nJustin Wolfers, aneconomics professor at the University of Michigan, noted on X that it\u2019s true that US trade policy and the prospects for the economy are \u201cmuch better today than they were yesterday.\u201d But it\u2019s also true, Wolfers said, to say that the situation is \u201cmuch worse today than on Inauguration Day.\u201d\nSuch is the speed and turbulence of the Trump 2.0 agenda.\nAfter Trump spiked tariffs at his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d event, Wolfers warned the odds of a recession would reach 75% if all the tariffs kicked in and stayed in place.\nNow Wolfers tells CNN that the risk of a recession has fallen sharply but still remains a coin-flip at roughly 50\/50.\n\u201cThere has been a wholly unnecessary supply chain disruption. You can\u2019t undo that. It will take some time to work itself out,\u201d Wolfers said in a phone interview.\nNationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic now sees the US economy eking out slightly positive growth this year, up from her prior call for no growth at all. Nationwide still sees inflation accelerating to 3.4% this year, but that\u2019s an improvement from 4% before the US-China breakthrough.\nTrump himself acknowledged on Monday that tariffs could still slingshot higher on China.\nAsked if tariffs would go back to 145% if no deal is reached at the end of the 90 days, Trump said: \u201cNo, but they\u2019d go substantially higher.\u201d He added: \u201cI think you will have a deal, however.\u201d\nIn other words, the US-China trade war is not over, even if it got dramatically less bad.\nAnd tariffs are not being suddenly removed from the president\u2019s tool chest.\nSector-specific tariffs still loom, including potentially on lumber, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper, critical minerals and trucks.\nJust last week the Commerce Department set the stage for potential aerospace tariffs bylaunching a national security probeinto imports of airplanes, jet engines and parts.\nThe risk of further tariffs ahead is one reason RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas is sticking to his forecast of a 55% chance of a recession over the next 12 months.\n\u201cWhile the agreement prevented an economic decoupling, and that is significant, there are still too many details to be determined, especially those sector tariffs, to remove a recession risk from the table,\u201d Brusuelas said.\nDeutsche Bank economists expressed relief on Monday about the easing trade war.\n\u201cThe global growth outlook is improving,\u201d Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a report. \u201cAmerican trade policy has turned more conciliatory and there is now a better defined range of tariff outcomes. The peak of the trade war uncertainty is in.\u201d\nOf course, uncertainty had almost nowhere to go but down.\nTrade policy uncertainty, asmeasured by an indexthat mentions the topic in major US newspapers, had skyrocketed in recent months to off-the-chart levels unseen since tracking began in the 1960s.\nThe sudden reduction in US and China tariffs will ease financial pressure on the business community but only adds to the sense of whiplash. And it remains to be seen exactly how businesses will respond to levels of uncertainty that Wolfers described as \u201cparalyzingly high.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a manufactured crisis,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin, who served as an economic adviser to Sen. John McCain during the 2008 presidential campaign.\nWolfers said investors and the business world are still bracing for the next shoe to drop when it comes to tariff policy out of the Trump White House.\n\u201cWhat are the chances that we have 90 days of calm ahead of us?\u201d Wolfers said. \u201cToday we have good news, but what would really be good news is if someone just took the button away from him.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/12\/business\/trump-recession-trade-war-china","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Some of the underlying figures were more encouraging than the GDP dip. Such reports are often amended upward as more data is processed. And although the US economy has been extraordinarily resilient, it\u2019s normal to see cycles of growth and decline in a capitalist nation.\nThe report is more important for its political and symbolic effect than for its snapshot of a slowing economy. Trump cannot afford for its flashing red lights to become conventional wisdom.\nTo start with, the data rained on a White House flattery offensive billingTrump\u2019s first 100 daysas the greatest-ever burst of presidential action. And it pointed to a growing political vulnerability. While much of Trump\u2019s support derives from his tough border policies, the idea that he\u2019s a master businessman who knows how to steer the economy is key to his mystique. If that is stripped away, his political foundation becomes weaker.\nSecond, the GDP report played into a growing sense that bleak economic days are ahead and that this is just the start. Trump cannot allow such an impression to take hold. Apart from its impact on his personal standing, panic among GOP lawmakers could rock the fragile unity of the fragile GOP majority in the House \u2014 which Trump needs to pass his \u201cbig, beautiful\u201dtax and budget plans.\nMore importantly, amid signs that consumers are already pulling back, evidence that rough times are ahead could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. History shows that a country can talk itself into a recession.\nThe world is watching, too. If Trump\u2019ssliding approval ratingscreate any impression of political weakness, it could undermine his negotiating position as heseeks to close trade dealswith dozens of countries seeking to avoid his tariffs. If foreign leaders think he\u2019s desperate, why would they put good offers on the table?\nAs usual, Trump\u2019s reaction tells the story.\nAfter the release of the GDP report, Trump published a panicky Truth Social post saying, \u201cThis is Biden\u2019s Stock Market not Trump\u2019s.\u201d He added, \u201cThis will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS.\u201d All day, the president slammed his predecessor to offset blame for the economic numbers. Later, he looked to future data. \u201cThis is Biden, and you could even say the next quarter is sort of Biden because it doesn\u2019t just happen on a daily or an hourly basis,\u201dTrump said.\nEvery administration blames its predecessor for grisly economic news \u2014 it\u2019s fair game in politics. And it\u2019s true that it takes time for an administration to establish its own economic policies and see the results. Trump is undoubtably responding to a real economic problem \u2014 the gutting of many communities in industrialized parts of America as the result of globalization.\nBut his claim that disappointing economic indicators are the fault of his predecessor would have more credibility had he not initiated the most disruptive assault on the global economic and trading system since World War II with little planning, questionable metrics and trademark chaos.\nThe day that Trump stood up in the White House Rose Garden with his scoreboard showing each nation\u2019s tariff rate, he took ownership of the economy. Many of the shocks and uncertainties that are weighing on investors and consumers can be traced directly back to \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d\nMillions of Americans, meanwhile, have seen the impact on their 401 (k) pension plans. These have been especially scary months for those who have just retired or plan to do so soon.\nAnd one important reason why Trump won the 2024 election is that voters judged him to have more credible answers on reducing the costs of living, such as groceries. Despite the president\u2019s attempts to obscure the truth, he\u2019s done little to mitigate those prices, which have a huge impact on the lives of those who \u2014 unlike most of his Cabinet members \u2014 are notmillionaires or billionaires.\nPublic perceptions have also been shaped by an avalanche of evidence that the economy is headed south.\n\u201cThis has probably been the least successful first 100 days of a presidency on the economy in history, in the last century,\u201d former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the stock market go down by as much as ever. We\u2019ve seen the dollar go down more than ever. We\u2019ve seen forecasts of unemployment go up. Forecasts of inflation go up. Forecasts of the odds of recession go up. We\u2019ve seen consumer confidence collapse. We\u2019ve seen businesses take back all their previous earnings projection.\u201d\nTop administration figures dismissed such a downbeat prognosis.\n\u201cThis was the best negative print, as they say in the trade, for GDP I have ever seen in my life. It really should be very positive news for America,\u201d Trump\u2019s trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters. Trump, meanwhile, claimed credit for a spike in investment in the report \u2014 raising the question of why that indicator was down to him while more negative figures were attributable to Biden.\nOther officials argued the Commerce Department numbers were influenced by a sudden tsunami of imports that suppressed the growth calculation. This, they said, gave a false reading of the economy\u2019s health. But the import surge came as companies stockpiled products in the expectation that Trump\u2019s tariffs would shut down trade. It is therefore more an indicator of coming economic problems than a marker of current strength.\nThe dueling mix of rhetoric and data coming out of the administration on Wednesday suggests the White House has a growing problem that will go a long way to dictating the shape of Trump\u2019s second term.\nHaving launched the US and the world into the economic unknown \u2014 on his own gut calls \u2014 Trump\u2019s path to a successful outcome is looking opaque.\nThat\u2019s why his comment on the cost of toys was so revealing.\nThe president was referring to the potential impact of his showdown with China \u2014 the most important front in the trade war. With Chinese President Xi Jinping still refusing to bend to the president\u2019s 145% tariff, the president has been insisting for days that he and his administration have been involved in intense talks with Beijing, despite no public evidence this is the case. US-based observers don\u2019t usually believe China\u2019s communist government over statements from Washington. But this administration\u2019s record of propaganda and falsehoods means that it\u2019s not getting much benefit of the doubt these days.\nThe president, describing China as the \u201cchief ripper-offer\u201d of US factories and workers, boasted that his action had caused cargo ships laden with goods for the US market to turn around and head back to port. He curiously painted all this as a good thing.\n\u201cYou know, somebody said, \u2018Oh, the shelves are going to be open,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cWell, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\u201d\nThe remark may have been flippant, but it was revealing nonetheless, and pointed to a looming trap for the president.\nThere is a solid argument that the United States has let itself become too reliant on cheap consumer goods from China and that, for the overall health of the nation, it would be better to have a more balanced economy.\nBut it\u2019s a discordant political argument for a billionaire president who moves in an orbit of wealthy CEOs and members of his Mar-a-Lago club to tell working parents that they will be able to afford fewer toys for their children.\nAnd this goes far beyond dolls.\nWhile the trans-Pacific pipeline of goods from China has hurt US domestic manufacturing, it has raised living standards for millions of Americans. Almost everyone has benefited from cheaper school supplies, clothes and consumer electronics like flat-screen TVs. Every parent knows how quickly kids grow out of their shoes. Most of that footwear comes from China.\nIf that suddenly goes away, there\u2019s going to be real pain.\nThis was one of the only times he\u2019s leveled with the Americans about the probable cost of his trade clash with Beijing.\nBut the White House is still trying to keep reality at bay. On Tuesday, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Amazon of a \u201chostile and political\u201d act followinga since-denied reportit planned to itemize the true cost of tariffs to shoppers on its websites.\nAnd much of Trump\u2019s day Wednesday was taken up by events featuring Cabinet members and friendly business figures lavishing him with praise.\n\u201cPresident, your first 100 days has far exceeded that of any other presidency in this country ever, ever. Never seen anything like it. Thank you,\u201d said Attorney General Pam Bondi during the pageant of sycophancy at the Cabinet meeting. It was not the first time recently that the White House communications effort has seemed more geared to boosting the president\u2019s morale than that of the country.\nSome of this is comical. But it suggests that a president who has set the economy and the world on a perilous course is not getting genuine advice about the consequences.\nSo the gap between reality and Trump\u2019s world will only grow, and will undermine statements like the one he madein Michigan on Tuesday night.\n\u201cOur Golden Age has only just begun.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/01\/politics\/trump-gdp-economy-golden-age-recession-perception","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Why don\u2019t you talk about them? Because some people on Wall Street say this is the greatest thing to ever happen,\u201d Trump said in an interview clip from \u201cMeet the Press with Kristen Welker\u201d released on Friday.\nPressed on whether he would be okay with a recession in the short term to achieve his long-term goals, the president said, \u201cLook yes, everything\u2019s OK. What we are \u2014 I said, this is a transition period. I think we\u2019re going to do fantastically.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s economic policies \u2014 and particularly the trade war he has ignited with his whipsaw, abrupt tariffs \u2014 have already sentthe world\u2019s largest economy into reverse: Gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered at an annualized rate of -0.3% in the first quarter, as businesses hoarded goods and consumer spending decelerated, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.\nThat was far worse than economists had expected, and it marked the worst quarter since 2022.\nTrump has warned previously that Americans would see some economic \u201cdisturbance\u201d throughout a transition period as his policiesreset the global economic orderfor friend and foe alike. He has imposed sweeping global tariffs (and paused some of them), and he has levied especially high import taxes against China, a major US trading partner.\nEarlier this week, for example, he acknowledged that tariffscould lead to shortages and higher pricesfor everyday Americans.\n\u201cYou know, somebody said, \u2018Oh, the shelves are going to be open,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cWell, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know?

And throwing sand into that growth engine can cause major disruptions.\nThe economy is weakening, certainly. But it\u2019s too early yet to tell if the US is in a recession; the official definition of a recession in the United States is \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\u201d\nThe clip is part of a larger interview expected to air on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.\nCNN\u2019s Allison Morrow contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/02\/business\/trump-recession-nbc-meet-the-press","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Americans fear an imminent recession. That may be enough to put us in one","date":"2025-04-29","body":"A powerful force is dominating the Trump economy: fear.\nAbout two-thirds (66%) of adults say they are pessimistic or afraid about the economy, according to new findings from a CNN\/SSRS poll released Monday. Just 34% say they feel enthusiastic or optimistic.\nThe overwhelming majority \u2013 69% \u2013 consider an economic recession in the next year to be at least somewhat likely, including 32% who say it\u2019s very likely.\nThis sense of dread in the first 100 days of the second Trump presidency isn\u2019t just a political problem for the White House. It\u2019s also a psychological problem for an economy that requires consumer spending to stay afloat.\nThis raises the risk of a recession becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Fear of a recession causes Americans toshop less and save more. Vacations aren\u2019t booked. Cars aren\u2019t purchased. Restaurants aren\u2019t full.\nCEOs, worried about consumers hunkering down, do the same. They hire fewer and fire more. And that causes consumers to pull back even further, prompting even more layoffs.\nIt can become a negative feedback loop that is hard to break.\nThe economy and financial markets are a confidence game \u2013 one that has been shaken by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and sweepingApril 2 tariff announcement, attacks on Federal Reserve independence and chaotic policymaking.\n\u201cApril 2nd was a turning point. It\u2019s been four weeks of chaos, and the chaos has been disruptive. We are beginning to pay the price for it,\u201d said David Kotok, co-founder of \ufeffinvestment management firm Cumberland Advisors.\nIt\u2019s clear that consumer sentiment has beendropping. The CNN poll found that seven in 10 of those under the age of 45 express pessimism or fear about the economy. So do 76% of Americans of color.\nAnd it\u2019s true that Democrats are more pessimistic than Republicans about the state of affairs. But the CNN poll found bipartisan economic concerns, with 39% of those who voted for Trump in 2024 saying a recession is very or somewhat likely in the next year.\nStill, it\u2019s far too early to know if the turbulence in financial markets will short-circuit the economic expansion that began after the Covid-19 pandemic crash.\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that weak consumer confidence does not cause a drop in consumer spending. That\u2019s exactly what happened in 2022, a time when many consumers and economists were similarly sounding the recession alarm \u2013 only to be proven wrong.\nThe US economy has proven very resilient. It shook off multiple Covid variants, the supply chain mess, the inflation crisis and the regional bank failures of 2023. And so far this year, there isn\u2019t much evidence that Americans have stopped spending.\nRetail sales jumpedandcar sales surged in Marchas consumers tried to beat the clock on tariffs.Restaurant reservationson OpenTable are higher than a year ago.\nAnd it\u2019s possible that the massive rebound in US stocks after Trump delayed country-specific tariffs for 90 days could improve the mood on main street as it did on Wall Street.\nWeak confidence among consumers could interrupt the business cycle.\n\u201cA lot of businesses are getting nervous. They could pause spending or cut back on travel and hiring. And that\u2019s what could make this a self-fulfilling prophecy,\u201d David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNN in a phone interview.\nConsider that 81% of small toy companies and 87% of mid-sized toy companies are delaying orders due to tariffs, according to an Aprilsurveyby the Toy Association, a trade group.\nThat same survey found that almost half of all small- and mid-sized toy makers say they will go out of business within weeks or months.\n\u201cWe are starting to see the first signs of the supply chain breakdown from tariffs. My expectation is that it will worsen,\u201d said Kotok, who pointed to a surge of container ships sitting offshore and canceled sailings.\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently said many business leaders fear the US economy is already in a recession, and JPMorgan\u2019s Kelly said he is most concerned about how CEOs will respond to economic worries.\nJust last week, Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan highlighted most severe drop in domestic leisure travel outside of the pandemic, tellingBloomberg News: \u201cI don\u2019t care if you call it a recession or not, in this industry, that\u2019s a recession.\u201d\nKelly said it may be a \u201cshallow\u201d recession but \u201cthe odds still favor us slipping into recession unless we see a sharp about-face on tariffs.\u201d\nTorsten Slok, chief economist at investment firm Apollo Global Management, goes a step further, saying there is a 90% chance of a \u201cvoluntary trade reset recession.\u201d\n\u201cExpect ships to sit offshore, orders to be canceled, and well-run generational retailers to file for bankruptcy,\u201d Slok wrote earlier this month in a report.\nJared Bernstein, a top economist for President Joe Biden during the last recession scare in 2022, cautioned against assuming a recession is inevitable.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through years of bad vibes and good data. We have to be careful not to over-torque on this,\u201d Bernstein told CNN in a phone interview.\nStill, Bernstein sees a roughly 50\/50 chance of a US recession because of thestagflationaryshock from tariffs, which are expected to simultaneously slow the economy and increase prices.\nThe policy whiplash is also a problem.\n\u201cEven if we believe (Trump) will dial back the trade war,\u201d Bernstein said, \u201chow confident can we be that he won\u2019t dial back his dial-back the next day?\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/29\/business\/recession-trump-tariffs-trade-war-cnn-poll","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Are we in a recession? Let\u2019s do a vibe check","date":"2025-04-30","body":"The US economy is contracting faster than expected. Is it a recession?\nMaybe. For a variety of reasons, we can\u2019t start bandying the R-word around just yet. But what we can do is step back, look at the data, and \u2014 in my very technical analysis \u2014 run a vibe check.\nThe upshot: It feels like we\u2019ve got a lot of recession energy.\nOn Wednesday, government data showedeconomic growth contractingfor the first time in three years. Gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, fell in the first three months of the year at an annualized rate of 0.3% \u2014 a much sharper decline than most economists predicted. It\u2019s also a stark decline from the quarter before, when the economyexpandedby 2.4%.\nLet\u2019s look at it in terms of purple bars (good) and yellow bars (bad).\nAfter the past couple of years with roughly 3% annualized GDP growth (look at all those purple bars above), the first-quarter contraction is a big red flag \u2014 or in this case, a yellow bar \u2014 in avastfieldofredflagsthat have been cropping up from sea to shining sea under President Donald Trump.\nWhile Trump was quick to shrug offWall Street\u2019s negative reactionto the GDP contraction \u2014 he called it, nonsensically, Joe Biden\u2019s \u201coverhang\u201d \u2014 it is impossible to separate the data from his radical tariff plans and the supply chain upheaval they\u2019ve created.\nThe data captures activity between January 1 and March 31, which includes the president\u2019s initial tariffs against America\u2019s two closest trading partners, Mexico and Canada, as well as the deep anxiety that was building in anticipation of his April 2 slate of \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs.\nWithin that time, consumer spending growth \u2014 the primary engine of the US economy \u2014 fell to a rate of 1.8%, down considerably from 4% in the prior three-month period.\nBy that measure, it was a \u201cmoderate quarter,\u201d wrote Justin Wolfers, economics professor at the University of Michigan, on social media Wednesday. \u201cNot recessionary; not great.\u201d\nAnd then there was the DOGE effect: Federal government spending went from 4% growth at the end of the Biden administration to a 5.1% contraction under Trump. That might be a good thing from a certain ideological perspective, but definitely hits the economy no matter what your politics are.\nMeanwhile, inflation rose at an estimated pace of 3.6% for the quarter, up from 2.4% during the fourth quarter, as measured by the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred gauge of price increases, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index. (Themonthly PCE report, also released Wednesday, showed prices rose 2.3% in March from a year earlier, and were mostly flat from February to March.)\nAll of those numbers, like Trump\u2019s 100-day polling figures, signal that Americans aren\u2019t loving the vibe. And the vibes matter: As my colleagueMatt Egan wrote this week, recessions tend to come to life when enough people expect them to.\nThe economy is weakening, certainly. But the official definition of a recession in the United States (yes, other countries have different definitions, because economics is a squishy field) is \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\u201d\nRule of thumb: You need to have at leasttwoquarters of back-to-back contractions in GDP to meet the standard set by the National Bureau of Economic Research, aprivate nonprofit organizationthat is the official arbiter of American recession-ology.\nAnd even with two negative quarters, there are some other factors that go into the calculation, such as how sharp the decline is, how long it lasts, and how widespread it\u2019s felt across the economy. (My colleague Alicia Wallace has more on all thathere.)\nBack in 2022, we actually had two consecutive quarters of contraction, but no recession. The second quarter was later revised (as they often are) when more data came in.\nAt that time, the momentary contraction reflected an economy lurching from one crisis (Covid) to another (inflation). Consumer demand was shifting from goods \u2014 like treadmills, TVs, cookware, all the tools of our various lockdown projects \u2014 to experiences (beach vacays, overseas flights, the Eras Tour). The contraction in GDP had more to do with lagging trade data than a true slowdown in economic activity.\nSo it\u2019s possible the first quarter of 2025 is a blip, like the one we saw in 2022. But there are some key differences that make today a bit more worrying.\nThe economy was so hot in 2022 that it was\u2026 too hot. GDP growth at the end of 2021 was near 7%. Unemployment was the lowest it had been in a generation and companies were expanding rapidly, adding hundreds of thousands of jobs every single month. Consumers couldn\u2019t stop spending money, even as inflation soared as high as 9.1% in June of 2022.\nWhile the current labor market remains strong, it\u2019s not expanding at the same feverish pace as it was then. Consumers have long blown through their pandemic savings and are beginning to pull back on expenditures like summer vacations and dinners out. And when they\u2019re buying more appliances and electronic goods, it looks like they\u2019re trying to get ahead of Trump\u2019s trade war \u2014 like people stocking up on eggs, bread and milk before a hurricane, rather than stocking up for a party.\nThe biggest difference between then and now comes down to who\u2019s in the White House.\nIt is difficult to overstate thereal economic damagethat\u2019s already playing out in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs and the haphazard way the White House has instituted them.\nThat kind of volatility, which has rattled financial markets and paralyzed businesses, simply wasn\u2019t present under any other administration in history. But we\u2019ll have to wait to find out exactly how much economic damage Trump has caused.\nThe second quarter\u2019s data, from April to June, will capture the full impact of Trump\u2019s extreme 145% tariff on China and 10% baseline tariff on the rest of the world.\nBottom line: The vibes are off. And the data is getting ugly, making a recession much more likely. There will be pain that Trump can\u2019t undo, even if he were to remove all the new tariffs he\u2019s put in place. But how long the pain lasts depends entirely on how long the tariffs, especially on China, remain in place.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/30\/business\/are-we-in-a-recession-nightcap","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

It comes during an already unprecedented string of events for young people \u2014 people in their early 20s areearning less and have more debt, already battered by theCovid-19 pandemicandan onslaught of inflation.\nSo, the United States might not be in a recession right now, but its youngest working adults are still anxious \u2014 and seeking advice from their older peers.\nWhen scrolling through TikTok,Sasha Whitney, 37, noticed Gen Z users shared the same feelings over an impending recession: \u201cdowntrodden, frustrated, very bleak and hopeless about the future.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a stark difference from when Whitney graduated from college in 2009 during the Great Recession, before social media became as pervasive and when Barack Obama, who ran his campaign on the concept of hope, just took office.\n\u201cWhen I talked to some of my millennial friends, they were like, \u2018Yeah, we were broke. We were struggling,\u2019\u201d said Whitney, whose primary audience on TikTok is aged 18 to 25 years old. \u201cHowever, we weren\u2019t trying to keep up with the Joneses. You weren\u2019t trying to portray a lifestyle for social media.\u201d\nOther millennials joked on social media about the sense of community they had during the recession, sounding nostalgic for the days of cheaper liquor, wearing business casual andendless replays of feel-good recession pop. \u201cIf you want to know how we survived, yeah we blacked out,\u201d one millennial user quipped onTikTok.\nRelated article10 years later, America\u2019s booming economy still bears scars of the Great Recession\nBut millennials did share their real financial struggles. After graduating, Whitney lived at home for a bit, then moved out, paying rent and student loans and leaving $20 a week for groceries. She worked in retail immediately out of college and figured out how to handle her finances through trial and error.\n\u201cI\u2019m buying packs of tuna, frozen vegetables, bread, putting it in the freezer. That\u2019s when it really hit me that something\u2019s going on,\u201d she said.\nWhitney\u2019sTikTok videowalked viewers through some recession tips, including: taking whatever job you can get, living below your means, and deleting payment platforms like Klarna and After Pay. Other videos from millennials on TikTok offer recession preparation guides, such has having anemergency savings fundand updated resumes.\n\u201cIf I can give somebody advice, especially younger folks, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Whitney said.\nMany TikTokers are vowing to do one thing: limit their spending.\nFor Imani Smith, a 29-year-old in Dallas,that meanspassword-sharing subscriptions with her friends and cutting back on going out to eat.\nBeauty maintenance is also a high cost, so she buys press-on nails from Amazon instead of going to the salon. Salon owners are reporting more requests for \u201crecession blonde,\u201d cheaper, more low-maintenance hairstyles.\nAnd despite thefamous lipstick index\u2014 the theory that small \u201ctreat yourself\u201d purchases uptick during economic downturns \u2014 social media users have promised to cut out small purchases like expensive lip balms and candles.\n\u201cI want to (save) and build a practice of doing it before I have to do it out of basic necessity,\u201d Smith, who described herself as in between a Gen Z and millennial, told CNN. She added that she uses TikTok, like many young people, as a search engine. In a video on TikTok, she asked viewers who were adults in 2008 whether her recession plan was good enough.\nWhen people sense their budgets contracting, they have to decide what they\u2019re going to spend on, Simon Blanchard, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business, said to CNN. He added it may be a good time to self-reflect if you have enough emergency savings, whether we\u2019re in a recession or not.\nPeople tend to cut an entire category of spending rather than a little bit of everything, so it doesn\u2019t seem like they have to downgrade on every part of their life, Blanchard said.\n\u201cAnd maybe those small indulgences like lipstick are the things that might be first to go because they\u2019re just non-essential,\u201d Blanchard said.\nDespite the advice from millennials to let go and live,as all the great music of the mid-2000s encouraged, anxiety still persists among many young people.\nAfter talking to people who lived through 2008, Smith said that \u201cthey might\u2019ve lost their jobs, but thecost of livingwas so low back then that they could have picked up something retail and held themselves afloat for a while,\u201d emphasizing her worries for the job market right now.\nFor many young people, their anxiety goes back to the Covid-19 pandemic. Smith had just started working her first corporate job when the pandemic hit,triggering the shortest recession in US historythat ended after two months in April 2020.\n\u201cIt put me in the mindset that I need to be prepared for anything,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBecause none of us could have anticipated Covid-19 and the lasting effects that had.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Lacey Russell contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/27\/business\/millennials-gen-z-recession-advice","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Recession odds are rising as Trump\u2019s trade war escalates, Goldman Sachs says","date":"2025-03-31","body":"The US economy faces a growing risk of a recession as surging tariffs threaten to stunt growth, reignite inflation and lift unemployment, according to Goldman Sachs.\nThe Wall Street bank warned clients Sunday night that it now sees a 35% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, up from 20% previously.\nGoldman Sachs also increased its inflation estimate, slashed its 2025 GDP forecast to just 1% and bumped up its year-end unemployment rate outlook by 0.3 percentage points to 4.5%.\nWhile Goldman Sachs still expects the US economy to avoid a downturn,other forecasters think it\u2019s more of a 50\/50 call.This is Goldman\u2019s highest recession probability since the regional banking crisis two years ago. The catalyst now is the shock from President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, which is set to intensify this week.\nGoldman Sachs blamed the \u201csharp recent deterioration in household and business confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of these policies,\u201d the bank\u2019s economists wrote in the report.\nConsumer confidence has plunged in recent months. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment survey, released Friday, showed the highest percentage of Americansexpecting unemployment to rise since the Great Recessionas inflation expectations hit 32-year highs.\n\u201cWhile sentiment has been a poor predictor over activity over the last few years, we are less dismissive of the recent decline because economic fundamentals are not as strong as in prior years,\u201d Goldman Sachs said.\nDuring the campaign, Trump promised to aggressively use tariffs. Yet investors, CEOs and economists have been caught off guard by just how aggressively he\u2019s kept that promise.\nTrump on Air Force One Sunday dismissed last week\u2019s reports from Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal that his administration would match tariffs dollar-for-dollar on just a handful of countries to start \u2013 perhaps the \u201cDirty 15\u201d countries with the largest trade imbalances with the United States as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had suggested a week ago.\n\u201cYou\u2019d start with all countries, so let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d Trump said Sunday. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a rumor about 15 countries, 10 or 15.\u201d\nUnderscoring that point, Goldman Sachs on Sunday increased its tariff assumptions for the second time in less than a month. The bank now expects the average US tariff rate to rise 15 percentage points in 2025, up from 10 points earlier this month and a level that was previously its \u201crisk case.\u201d\nThe change was driven almost entirely by the likelihood of more aggressive reciprocal tariffs that average 15% across all US trading partners. Goldman Sachs expects that the reciprocal tariff impact will get lowered to 9 percentage points after accounting for exclusions for certain countries and products.\n\u201cHigher tariffs are likely to boost consumer crisis,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists wrote, noting that higher prices will eat into inflation-adjusted income.\nTrump had said last week that his reciprocal tariffs, set to be announced Wednesday, would be \u201clenient.\u201d But Peter Navarro, White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing,told Fox News Sundaythat he expected Trump\u2019s tariffs to raise as much as $600 billion a year \u2013 an historic tax increase that could raise costs for millions of Americans.\nGoldman Sachs now sees core inflation at 3.5% at the end of the year, up from its prior estimate of 3%.Core inflation accelerated to 2.8% in February, according to the Fed\u2019s go-to inflation measure.\nGoldman Sachs now expects the Fed to aid the economy by cutting rates three times this year, up from two cuts in its previous call.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/31\/business\/recession-tariffs-goldman-sachs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Job growth seems shaky. Consumer confidence has dropped. And there are renewed concerns about inflation. Whether all of thatsparks a recession\u2013 a downturn that is spread across the economy and protracted in length \u2013 remains to be seen, although most economists still place the likelihood of a recession at less than 50%.\nThe attitude of Trump and his economic advisers is full steam ahead with tariffs and Trump\u2019s nationalist, bullying attitude toward foreign countries, even if it triggers a downturn. The pain a recession would impose on Americans and the economy might be a fair trade, they believe, for imposing their vision of an economy less dependent on taxpayer money and more robust in domestic manufacturing.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the economy has an addiction that needs kicking.\n\u201cThe market and the economy have just become hooked,\u201dBessent told CNBCthis month. \u201cWe\u2019ve become addicted to this government spending, and there\u2019s going to be a detox period.\u201d\nRelated articleRecession fears are being blown out of proportion.

It was mitigated by massive amounts of government spending.\nBut this recession coincided with Trump\u2019s election loss.\nGreat Recession from 2007 to 2009: Sparked by the housing bubble and the subprime mortgage crisis, among other things, the Great Recession saw a protracted spike in the unemployment rate. This recession is associated with the beginning of the Obama era.\nThe Dotcom Bust: The recession is pegged to 2001, although the bursting of the dotcom bubble that precipitated that recession may have soured the national mood heading into the 2000 presidential election that saw Al Gore narrowly lose to George W. Bush.\nIf you\u2019re seeing a theme there, it\u2019s that recessions lead to political frustration, although the US has arguably been in a period of turmoil for the entire Trump era.\nTrump is constitutionally ineligible to seek reelection in 2028, but that does not mean a recession, even a short one, wouldn\u2019thurt him or Republicans. More importantly, higher unemployment and the economic pain resulting from a recession would hurt most Americans.\nRecessions from further back in history bear out the idea that voters punish presidents in power during a recession. A recession in 1990 sparked by the savings and loan crisis in 1990 probably hurt President George H.W. Bush, who lost to Bill Clinton in 1992.\nA recession in 1980 clearly helped cost President Jimmy Carter his bid for reelection.\n(For more on the private, nonprofit organization that determines when a recession occurs, and how that doesn\u2019t usually happen until after the recession,read thisfrom CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace.)\n\u201cI worked for two administrations that inherited recessions and tried to get out of them,\u201d said Rahm Emanuel, the CNN political commentator and former Chicago mayor who served as a top aide to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an administration try to drive toward a recession.\u201d\nMark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, told CNN Wednesday that Trump\u2019s policies, particularly raising taxes on imports through tariffs, are actively courting a downturn.\n\u201cWe can talk ourselves into recession, but this one feels like we\u2019re being pushed into recession,\u201d Zandi told CNN\u2019s Rahel Solomon this week.\nEconomists of all stripes still say the likelihood of a recession is low, but rising.\nUCLA\u2019s Anderson School of Business has placed the country on a \u201crecession watch,\u201d arguing that \u201cif fully or nearly fully enacted,\u201d Trump\u2019s vision for a new economy could cause a downturn in the next year or two.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, the recession could end up being stagflationary,\u201d according to UCLA, suggesting the economy could stagnate at the same time prices rise through inflation.\nRelated articleSo, what is stagflation, anyway, and why is it so scary?\nLarry Summers, the treasury secretary during the Bill Clinton administration who also served in the Obama administration, told CNN this week that he hopes Trump can be convinced \u2013 by courts, Congress or public frustration \u2013 to moderate his policies on tariffs and government cuts.\n\u201cBut if that doesn\u2019t happen, we are headed back towards stagflation with both recession and rising prices that will be much more serious than what we are seeing today,\u201d Summers said.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, referring to these and other assessments, admitted at a press conference this week that likelihood of a recession \u201chas moved up, but is not high.\u201d\nRecession concerns don\u2019t always turn into recessions.

{"title":"A significant group of Americans are falling behind on their car payments - an economic warning sign","date":"2025-10-22","body":"A key group of American borrowers is falling significantly behind on their car loans. It\u2019s yet another sign that the US economy is forming some serious cracks, leaving the most vulnerable in financial distress.\nThe percentage of subprime borrowers \u2013 those with credit scores below 670 \u2013 who are at least 60 days late on their car loans has doubled since 2021 to 6.43%, according to Fitch Ratings. That\u2019s worse than during the past three recessions \u2013 during the Covid pandemic, the Great Recession or the dot-com bust.\nAmerica\u2019s current subprime delinquency rate is at the second-highest level since the early 1990s. The only time it was higher: this past January. Cars are being repossessed at the highest rate since the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009.\nIt\u2019s a disturbing trend to economists: Car loans are typically the last payments that Americans are willing to miss. They\u2019re too important to their lives: Cars are essential tools to get to work, drive families and access food.\nRecord car pricesandhigh interest rates, combined with otherinflationary pressures, have sent average auto payments to record levels and have put significant stress on car owners.\nAlthough the financial stress on subprime car borrowers has stabilized in 2025 after large increases in late payments and repossessions over the past two years, economists fear what might happen if thelabor marketgrows considerably weaker and layoffs become more common.\nFor subprime borrowers, the default rate \u2013 those whose cars have been or are about to be repossessed \u2013 which stood at nearly 10% in September, according to Cox Automotive data. That\u2019s down from a year ago but above the long-term average.\nThose borrowers often have no choice but to default. They can\u2019t sell their cars because they owe so much more than it is worth. They often have already missed payments on other obligations, such as mortgage payments or rent, as well as payments due on credit cards and student loans.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room for error,\u201d said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.\nJust over half of new car leases and more than three-quarters of new car loans made in the second quarter had monthly payments of $500 or more, and 46% of used car loans have payments of $500 or above, according to Experian. For new car loans, more than 17% have payments of more than $1,000.\nRepair costs have also surged \u2013 at a time when many are holding onto their cars for longer to avoid splurging on a new one. Motor vehiclerepair costs surged 15%year-over-year in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s the most in nearly two years. And repair costs increased 5% between July and August, the biggest monthly increase on record.\nMeanwhile, car insurance rates have increased significantly since the pandemic. In August, car insurance rose by the smallest annual rate in three years \u2013 but that still amounted to a hefty near-5% jump, well above the overall inflation rate.\nThe increased costs of owning and maintaining a car aren\u2019t happening in a vacuum: They\u2019re taking place after years of rising prices at the supermarket and across the economy. And two years ago, manystudent loan paymentsthat were paused during the pandemic became due again. A year ago, delinquent student loan payments started counting against credit scores again, pushing some borrowers into lower credit ratings that could raise the rates they were charged on other loans, including car loans.\nElevated subprime delinquency rates demonstrate how beneath the surface of blockbuster stock market returns and strong overall economic growth, many consumers are hurting.\nTellingly, Americans with stronger credit scores don\u2019t appear to be struggling to make car payments. The delinquency rate among prime borrowers has increased significantly but remains very low at less than 0.5%.\n\u201cThere are no alarm bells going off for prime borrowers,\u201d said Rod Chadehumbe, chief asset backed securities strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.\nThe wide gap between delinquency rates of prime and subprime borrowers is another reminder of the so called K-shaped economy: Many Americans who have money in the stock market and own increasingly valuable homes are doing well and spending aggressively, but many others, especially lower-income consumers, are struggling to stay afloat.\nA number of lenders who specialize in subprime car loans expect a growing percentage of their clients to default and have their car repossessed, said Pamela Foohey, a law professor at the University of Georgia and an expert in both auto finance and bankruptcies.\nThe repo business has been quite active lately. Subprime lenders build GPS features into cars to make it easier for teams repossessing the vehicles to find them, she said. The lenders can even disable the ignition of the cars to prevent owners from driving them once they\u2019ve defaulted on the loan.\n\u201cThe (repo) numbers indicate it\u2019s probably close to the Great Recession in volume,\u201d said George Badeen, who runs Midwest Recovery and Adjustment in Detroit, and is also president of one of his industry\u2019s trade groups. \u201cIt\u2019s a target-rich environment at the moment.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/22\/business\/car-payments-late-default-subprime","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

GDP forecasts are getting slashed. President Donald Trump and his economic team are facing questions about apossible recession\u2014and failing toease mounting jittersabout the economy.\nUS stocks retreated again on Tuesday, failing to rebound from Monday\u2019s steep losses. The Dow dropped about 400 points (around 1%) and the Nasdaq dropped again after its worst day in two and a half years.\nSelling accelerated after Trumpannouncedplans to lob a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada \u2013 and warned more tariffs could be on the way.\nIt\u2019s stunning how fast the mood has flipped. Investors who just a few months ago wondered if the economy was perhaps too strong are now bracing for real trouble ahead.\nThe reality is that the US economydoesn\u2019t appear to be near an imminent recession. It wasgrowing at a steady clipat the end of last year. The first quarter isn\u2019t even over yet. And the jobs market was still in growth mode in January and February.\nIt\u2019s way too early to say the economy is destined for a recession, a deep downturn typically marked by mass job loss, bankruptcies and foreclosures.\nPrevious recession scares were, with the benefit of hindsight, way overdone. Recall the 2022 recession freakout that featured someflashing a 99% chance of a recession.\nThe bad news is economists say the risk of a recession has in fact gone up, albeit from relatively low levels.\nAnd uncertainty about Trump\u2019s economic agenda \u2014especially confusion about his tariff plans\u2014 is a big part of the problem.\n\u201cThis is a very resilient economy. It can take a licking and keep on ticking. But it doesn\u2019t like this uncertainty,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\nOn Monday, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told CNN there\u2019s a \u201creal possibility\u201d of a recession.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a real possibility of a vicious cycle where a weakening economy leads to weaker markets, and then weaker markets lead to a weakening economy,\u201d he said in an on-air interview.\nKelly said the economy and market are suffering from an \u201cuncertainty tax\u201d caused by questions about Trump\u2019s tariffs, federal spending cuts and mass layoffs of federal workers.\n\u201cRight now, a lot of businesspeople are like deer in headlights. That\u2019s a very dangerous place to be,\u201d he said.\nBill Dudley, former president of the New York Federal Reserve, told CNN on Monday that it\u2019s \u201cpremature\u201d to forecast a recession but added that the risk has \u201cdefinitely gone up.\u201d Dudley pinned the blame on confusion over the trade war.\n\u201cTariffs have two effects: One, they push up prices. And two, they push down growth,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cThe Trump administration is making things worse with this on-again, off-again approach. The uncertainty level is higher than it needs to be.\u201d\nSummers noted that markets rely on predictability but instead have seen \u201csurprise after surprise after surprise.\u201d\n\u201cAll of this emphasis on tariffs and all of the ambiguity and uncertainty created about tariffs has, ironically, both chilled demand, made businesses not invest, made consumers think they should hold off before making big spending commitments,\u201d he said.\nThis confusion is spilling over into the market.\nAfter its worst week in six months, the S&P 500 lost another nearly 3% on Monday. The benchmark index has now dropped about 9% since hitting a record high on February 19.\n\u201cThe stock market is losing confidence in the Trump 2.0 policies,\u201d Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cEverything is at risk now, mostly because of the administration\u2019s rush to establish so many objectives in a very short period of time \u2014 with unintended consequences.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Fear & Greed Indexof market sentiment tumbled further into \u201cextreme fear\u201d mode on Monday, a big shift from \u201cneutral\u201d just a few weeks ago.\nTech stocks are suffering the brunt of the selling as investors rush out of risky corners of the market and into defense areas like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples.\nThe Nasdaq plunged 4% on Monday, its biggest one-day drop since September 2022. The losses were led by the Magnificent 7, the group of sevenonce-unstoppable high-growth stocks. Of those, Tesla plummeted 13%, while Nvidia, Apple and Alphabet lost more than 5% apiece.\nOf course, the stock market is not the economy.\nThe unemployment rate remains low at 4.1%. The economyadded jobs in February for the 50th month in a row, the second-longest period of uninterrupted growth in modern history.\nYet there is a risk that the market turmoil spills over into the real economy.\nConsumer confidence, already tumbling in recent months, could take a further hit as Americans tune into the market turmoil. That in turn could depress consumer spending \u2013 the main driver of the US economy.\nDelta Air Linesslashed its profit outlookon Monday, warning that deteriorating corporate and consumer confidence is hurting travel demand.\nYardeni is worried about the \u201cnegative wealth effects\u201d caused by a continued market slump.\n\u201cTrump is going to have to rethink his notion that it\u2019s okay to let the market go down while he is experimenting with tariffs and slashing federal payrolls,\u201d he said.\nIn another potential warning sign on the economy, corporate bankruptcies are starting to pile up.\nUS corporate bankruptcies totaled 129 through the first two months of 2025, the highest total for this point in the year since 2010 in the aftermath of the Great Recession, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nCiting the risk of higher tariffs, Goldman Sachs increased its recession forecast on Friday \u2014 but not dramatically. The Wall Street bank now sees a 20% chance of a recession over the next 12 months, up from 15% previously.\n\u201cWe raised it by only a limited amount at this point because we see policy changes as the key risk, and the White House has the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note to clients.\nIn other words, Goldman Sachs is betting that Trump will blink on tariffs if a recession looks imminent.\nBut what if Trump doesn\u2019t blink?\n\u201cIf the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists wrote, \u201crecession risk would rise further.\u201d\nAnother major question mark: How will the Federal Reserve respond to the ongoing growth scare?\nDudley, the former NY Fed chief, said Trump\u2019s tariffs put the Fed in a bind by simultaneously raising prices and hurting the economy.\nThat can have the effect of paralyzing the Fed, preventing officials from moving interest rates higher or lower.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Fed is locked on hold for many, many months,\u201d Dudley said, adding that a rate cut in May would be \u201cway too soon\u201d even though some on Wall Street are predicting that.\nThe US economy has proven to be very resilient in recent years.\nIt withstood Covid-19 variants, supply-chain chaos, a four-decade high for inflation and the Fed\u2019s war on inflation.\nBut it clearly faces a new test now, one driven in large part by turbulence in Washington.\nCNN\u2019s Bryan Mena contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/11\/business\/recession-economy-trump-dow-stocks","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The revision resulted from ramped-up tariffs that the bank\u2019s economists view as capable of putting a substantial drag on business activity to the point that it \u201cthrows the US economy and global economy into a recession.\u201d\nRecent surveys indicated that businesses are delaying investments and seeing revenue decline as customers put off purchases, in part due to tariffs.\nAdditionally, consumer spending, the backbone of the US economy that accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP, appears to be getting less and less sturdy.\nThe latest read on consumer spendingshows that it dropped by way more than economists expected.

Here\u2019s what history and the current economic picture can tell us about the potential for a recession:\nThe traditional (and official) definition of a US recession is \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\u201d\nThat\u2019s according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, aprivate nonprofit organizationhas a very important role, when it comes to these downturns: Its Business Cycle Dating Committee is the official designator of peaks, troughs, expansions, contractions \u2014 and yes, recessions \u2014 in the business cycle.\nThe committee, in making its recession determination, uses three criteria: depth, diffusion and duration.\nThis is where it gets a little squishy.\nRelated articleDow falls 900 points in market rout after Trump says he won\u2019t rule out a recession\nWhile each of those need to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions in one of those areas can offset weaker conditions in the others.\nAlso, it\u2019s often the case that the US already is in a recession by the time the Business Cycle Dating Committee officially deems it so.\nPrognosticators have turned to other gauges as potential recessionary indicators; however, they don\u2019t always prove true.\nThe biggest rule of thumb or nonofficial recession indicator is the technical notion of back-to-back quarterly contractions in real gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of economic activity.\n\u201cWe have to be careful with that definition,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY Parthenon, told CNN Monday. \u201cA contraction in GDP can come from multiple sources, including, as may be the case in the first quarter (of this year), from an environment where you have a surge in imports.\u201d\nThe runningforecast of GDPfrom the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates that first-quarter GDP may decline by an annualized adjusted rate of 2.4%, the first quarterly contraction in the US since 2022.\nImport activity has accelerated and the trade deficit has grown in recent months as businesses and consumers ramped up purchases in advance of potential tariffs levied by the Trump administration.\nPlus, the back-to-back GDP indicator isn\u2019t always accurate: The US experienced this in the first half of 2022, although the second quarter was eventually revised into a slight expansion. While those declines set off alarm bells, 2022 was a year of transition as the economy sought to recover from the sharp and sudden downturn caused by the global pandemic.\nImbalances in trade and inventories had an outsized effect on the GDP data in the earlier part of that year.\nIf the rule of thumb can\u2019t always be trusted, and the official ruling comes late to the party, what are recession events?\nThe NBER committee has its 3 Ds and Daco has his \u201cTriple P\u201d rule: \u201ca profound, pervasive and persistent contraction.\u201d\n\u201cIt can\u2019t just be a blip in economic activity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be pervasive in that it can\u2019t just be one sector or one weak region of the economy. It has to be across sectors and across regions of the country, and it has to last.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThere has to be some persistence. So, it can\u2019t just be a one-month mishap with consumer spending or employment, or whatever economic data we get \u2014 it has to last some time.\u201d\nThe exception to the rule was the recession triggered during the Covid-19 pandemic in that it was extremely profound, extremely pervasive, but very short-lived, he said.\nEconomic warning signals haveincreasingly been trippedin recent weeks as the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping policy changes across major areas of the economy have heightened uncertainty.\nLayoffs areticking higherand inflation reaccelerated last month, withconsumer prices risingat their fastest pace since August 2023. Data also showed consumer confidence tooka significant hitin February.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any indication that there is an imminent recession, but we are seeing signs that private sector activity is cooling,\u201d Daco said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing slower labor market momentum. We\u2019re seeing consumers spending with more caution. We\u2019re seeing businesses adopting a bit of a wait-and-see approach, and we have a lot of uncertainty and a lot of downside risks from the policies \u2014  in particular, the trade policies that are being implemented.\u201d\nTo that end, there are plenty of reasons to be cautious right now, Daco said.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t necessarily a reason to be extremely concerned about an imminent recession, because we\u2019re coming out of two very strong years of growth,\u201d he said, \u201can environment where income growth was strong, where productivity growth was strong, where consumer spending growth is strong and, really, where the economy overall was quite strong.\u201d\nHowever, as 2025 rolls on, and if the headwinds from restrictive trade and immigration policy as well as overall uncertainty, continue to persist, that could lead to a more pronounced slowdown in economic activity that could trigger stress in financial markets.\nOne of the biggest areas to watch in the coming months will be the financial health of Americans.\nRelated articleCracks are forming in America\u2019s economy. Trump is a big reason why\n\u201cConsumer spending is the main pillar of the US economy; so, if it were to start cracking, then that would remove one of the main foundations of the US economy, and could precipitate a recession,\u201d Daco said. \u201cThe trajectory right now of consumer spending is not in and of itself concerning \u2014 on average, we\u2019re still seeing strong consumer spending momentum \u2014 but higher income individuals are doing more than their fair share of spending\u201d\nAnd if that group pares back or has its confidence shaken, that would be a concern, he said.\nFor now, Trump\u2019s tariff policies seem to be sowing confusion for businesses, consumers and investors. Over the past few weeks, the Trump administration hasimposed steep tariffson America\u2019s three largest trading partners, Canada, China, and Mexico, stoking fears of increased prices. Trump has said the tariffs on Canada and Mexico are a result of the countries\u2019 policies around undocumented immigration and drug trafficking. Last last week he said he was delaying the bulk of his most severe tariff threats. They are now set to go into effecton April 2.\nDaco said uncertainty and confusion around such policies does not help the overall economic picture.\n\u201cWhat you have right now is a lack of clarity of policy, a lack of clarity of policy intention and a lack of clarity as to the objectives of policy,\u201d Daco said. \u201cAll of those combine for a certain sense of unease from the business community, because there\u2019s no clear destination in terms of where policy will settle.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/10\/economy\/us-recession-explained","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Recession fears are being blown out of proportion. Worry about inflation instead","date":"2025-03-09","body":"Bad news about the US economy travels fast, but examples of a slowing economy are potentiallybeing blown out of proportion.\nConsumer spending declined in Januaryfor the first time in nearly two years, a real-time forecast of economic growthrecently turned negative, the housing market was off to a sluggish start this year and the air isrife with uncertaintybecause of President Donald Trump\u2019s frenetic back-and-forth on tariffs.\nThe Conference Board\u2019s latest consumer survey even showed that the share of respondents expecting a recession in the coming year jumped in February to a nine-month high.\nBut data for the beginning of the year was skewed by temporary forces, such as unusually harsh weather and wildfires. The underlying fundamentals remain solid:Employers continue to add jobs at a healthy pace, unemployment has stayed low and wages are still outpacing inflation.\nAnd it\u2019s true that Americans arefeeling uneasy because of Trump\u2019s tariffs, but sentiment is not great at predicting future spending behavior.\nOne cause for concern, though: The Fed still isn\u2019t done bringing inflation to target, and the threat of a global trade war sparked by the Trump administration could jack up consumer prices further.\n\u201dDemand is showing some fraying around the edges, but it hasn\u2019t accumulated to enough to be a meaningful risk of a downturn.\u201d Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Investments, told CNN. \u201cInflation is still a top priority.\u201d\nIn January, large swaths of the United States werebuffeted by severe winter storms; over in southern California, deadly wildfiresravaged neighborhoods.\nThose events likely curbed economic activity that month, economists say: Consumer spending fell 0.2%, according to government data, as home construction plunged 9.8%. That triggered a real-time forecast of economic growth by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta to show the economy contracting a sharp 2.4% in the current quarter. (The numbers will almost certainly change in the government\u2019s official estimate of gross domestic product for the first quarter, due in April.)\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only gotten data for early in quarter, and that GDP tracker adds in new data as we go along,\u201d so the numbers can be affected by a big drop, said Blake Gwinn, head of US rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to even out.\u201d\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said in a speech Monday that rough weather was likely the culprit behind shoppers pulling back earlier this year, which is why he still thinks that \u201cthe prospects for continued growth look good.\u201d\n\u201cPart of my optimism about economic activity stems from the labor market, where conditions remain solid,\u201d Musalem said.\nThe US economy added 151,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said Friday, as average hourly earnings continued to rise faster than inflation. Unemployment edged higher in February but remained relatively low.\nBut what about the economic jitters?\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday he\u2019s not too worried for one reason: \u201cSentiment readings have not been a good predictor of consumption growth in recent years.\u201d\nSeveral Federal Reserve officials have recently noted economic uncertainty and signs of slower growth. But none of them mentioned recession worries.\nRather, some of them pointed to the risk of inflation picking back up again, if the tariff spat among the United States and its three biggest trading partners spirals out of control. Trump has imposed additional levies on Chinese imports and has applied \u2014 and then suspended \u2014 tax hikes on Canadian and Mexican imports. Retaliation and tough rhetoric has escalated trade tensions among the countries \u2014 a rapid-fire back-and-forth that\u2019s given consumers and businesses whiplash.\n\u201cBased on what we know today, given all the uncertainties around that, I do factor in some effects of tariffs now on inflation, on prices, because I think we will see some of those effects later this year,\u201d New York Fed President John Williams said Tuesday at an event hosted by Bloomberg.\nPhiladelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Thursday at an event in Philadelphia that price \u201cpressures are building\u201d and that the progress the Fed has seen so far in taming inflation is \u201cat risk.\u201d\nThe Fed stopped cutting interest rates in January precisely because there was little progress on the inflation front in the final months of 2024. The tide hasn\u2019t turned enough for the Fed to consider lowering borrowing costs again anytime soon, with Wall Street betting that the Fed will hold rates steady again later this month, according to futures.\n\u201cWith inflation risks decidedly tilted to the upside and labor market conditions still generally solid, we believe a reactive Fed will maintain a wait-and-see approach over the coming months and expect only two Fed rate cuts in 2025, in June and December,\u201d Lydia Boussour, senior economist at Ernst & Young, said in commentary issued Friday.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/09\/business\/recession-fears-inflation","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Job growth skyrocketed in December, boosting one of the strongest labor markets in US history","date":"2025-01-10","body":"The US economy closed out 2024 with another month of massive job growth, adding 256,000 positions in December.\nThe unemployment rate dipped to 4.1% from 4.2%, wrapping up a year that marked a return to pre-pandemic norms, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday.\nWhile the final jobs report for 2024 underscores how the US labor market has turned the corner since the pandemic, there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty as to what 2025 could bring for the trajectory of the labor market \u2014 in part because of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s potential policy changes involving trade, immigration, taxes and the federal workforce.\nIncluding December\u2019s gains,which are subject to revision, the economy added about 2.2 million jobs in 2024, an average of 186,000 jobs per month. That\u2019s in line with annual totals from 2017 to 2019 but marks a slowdown from the blowout gains seen during the pandemic recovery during the prior years.\n\u201cThe labor market is strong, and in an aggregate sense, it really doesn\u2019t get much better than this,\u201d Elizabeth Crofoot, senior economist at labor analytics firm Lightcast, told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s very robust job growth. We have low unemployment \u2014 it ticked down in the latest month. Layoffs are low. People have jobs, and they are spending, and that continues to bolster the economy and the labor market.\u201d\nThe US has now added jobs for 48 months in a row, tying the second-longest period of employment expansion on record.\nFriday\u2019s data also appears to cap off a historic achievement for President Joe Biden: Barring revisions, he\u2019s the first US president to oversee monthly job gains for the entirety of his presidency, according to BLS records that go back to 1939.\nHowever, there are important caveats to note: President Barack Obama, who along with Donald Trump, helped oversee the largest employment expansion ever (113 months), had no monthly net job losses during his second term. Also, economic cycles carry over regardless of party, and the ups and downs of the labor market are influenced by factors beyond a single president.\nEconomists were expecting a net gain of 153,000 jobs and for the unemployment rate to stay at 4.2%, according to FactSet.\nUS stocks dropped sharply after the better-than-expected report, with the Dow falling by more than 600 points. The 10-year Treasury yield surged to 4.7% as traders fear the robust data and a stronger economy could lead the Federal Reserve to pause its rate-cutting campaign.\nThe December jobs report was expected to provide a more straightforward look at the health and trajectory of the labor market following two distorted reports: October, which came in much weaker due to hurricanes and labor strikes; and November, which came in much stronger, since it included the return of those missing workers.\nOctober\u2019s employment gains were revised up by 7,000 to 43,000; and November\u2019s payroll gains were revised down by 15,000 to 212,000, according to Friday\u2019s report.\nStill, it\u2019s likely December was a little muddied up as well, economists said.\nThe ongoing hurricane-related recovery as well as seasonal moves (the retail industry added 43,400 jobs last month following a downswing of 29,200 jobs in November) likely factored into December\u2019s stronger-than-anticipated gains, said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\nRelated articleTrump is considering a national economic emergency declaration to allow for new tariff program, sources say\n\u201cA big chunk of the headline number is from post-hurricane recovery, and the range of hiring remains narrow,\u201d Frick wrote in commentary Friday. \u201cThe usual suspects \u2014 health care and government \u2014 again accounted for the biggest gains. Retail jobs swelled, but that\u2019s a seasonal phenomenon. Still, a good report means the expansion will continue and consumer purchasing power is rising.\u201d\nThe labor market has shown resilience and stability after recovering from a once-in-a-generation pandemic and navigating the dual pressures of fast-rising prices and high interest rates. The unemployment rate has remained low, employment participation has increased (especially among women and prime-aged workers), productivity has increased and wage gains have outpaced inflation for 19 months.\nWages rose 3.9% on an annual basis in December, according to Friday\u2019s report. Pay gains have moderated significantly in recent years but still remain above pre-pandemic levels, when they rose around 3%.\nThe solid labor market has helped fuel consumer spending, which in turn has kept the overall economy strong (GDP is growing at arobust 3.1% annualized rate) as inflation has eased \u2014 perhaps setting the stage for the rare achievement of a \u201csoft landing\u201d of price stabilization without a recession.\nStill, the job market isn\u2019t impenetrable. Job growth is slowing, hiring has dropped off, the manufacturing sector is exhibiting some weakness and people are staying unemployed for longer, fueling concerns that a greater weakening could be afoot.\nThe job gains also have been somewhat narrow. The lion\u2019s share (about 75%) of the job gains in 2024 occurred in health care, government (specifically, state and local hires) and leisure and hospitality \u2014 three industries that were continuing to play catch-up from the pandemic.\nEconomists and other policymakers have sounded the alarm bells as to how Trump\u2019s pledges such as stiff tariffs, mass deportations and plans to\u201ccut the government down to size\u201dcould cause inflation to reaccelerate and raise the cost of living;exacerbate job shortages in industries such asagriculture, health care, food service, child care and construction; and hamper agencies that provide services to the general public.\n\u201cOne downside risk for job growth is the potential for immigration restrictions from the incoming Trump administration, which would constrain the number of available workers,\u201d Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, wrote in a note on Friday.\nThe Fed, with an eye to ensuring maximum employment in addition to cooler inflation, has cut interest rates by a full point in recent months. The pace of cuts, however,is expected to moderate in 2025, the Fed has indicated, noting potential risks to inflation as well as underlying strength in the labor market.\nConsidering Friday\u2019s employment gains, a cut in January isn\u2019t likely, said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\nRelated articlePowell led the Fed\u2019s fight against inflation. It\u2019s not over yet \u2014 and it could get even harder\n\u201cThe US labor market ended 2024 on a firm footing with strong employment growth, falling unemployment and resilient wage pressures,\u201d Rosner wrote in a statement. \u201cThe strength of today\u2019s December jobs report puts to rest lingering chances of a [quarter-point] cut in January and shifts the focus to the March meeting, where further rate cuts will depend on progress on inflation.\u201d\nInflation has cooled substantially after peaking in the summer of 2022; however, prices are still rising above the Fed\u2019s 2% target (the central bank\u2019s preferred gaugewas up 2.4%through November).\nProgress on inflation has stalled out some in recent months as key contributors, particularly housing-related, remain high. Still, Fed officials expect inflation to continue to slowly cool; however, that progress could hinge heavily on moves made by the new administration, economists say.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s really where the focus is: How are trade, tax and immigration policy going to impact inflation and the Fed\u2019s decisions for 2025,\u201d Lightcast\u2019s Crofoot said. \u201cWith so much policy uncertainty and with a healthy labor market and pretty robust job growth, the smartest thing to do in terms of interest rates is to just wait out the data and see what those incoming policy changes are before they react one way or another.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/10\/economy\/us-jobs-report-december-final","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Fed leaves rates unchanged. But here are changes you can make to earn more on savings or pay less on debt","date":"2025-03-19","body":"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday decidedyet again to stand paton interest rates. Despite the Fed\u2019s inaction, there are still opportunities to maximize the interest you earn on your savings or reduce what you pay on your debts.\nRelated articleThe Fed holds interest rates steady amid Trump\u2019s chaotic trade war\nGiven the Trump administration\u2019s whipsaw tariff policies and its smiting ofthe United States\u2019 closest allies, many analysts have now reduced their US growth forecasts. So did the Fed, noting in its policy statement Wednesday that it expects weaker growth and higher inflation than previously assumed. However, it also noted \u201chigh uncertainty\u201d surrounding the effects of the White House\u2019s actions on the economy. It is continuing to pencil in the likelihood of making two quarter-point cuts this year.\n\u201cWhile the idea of interest rates coming down is appealing to many consumers and businesses, the reason for lower interest rates is very important. We want interest rates to decline because inflation declines, not because of economic weakness,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, in an email. \u201cSo be careful what you wish for.\u201d\nEither way, you can take steps now to protect your bottom line in the current rate environment.\nEven though interest rates have been coming down slowly in recent months, you can still get inflation-beating returns for your cash savings, in very easy, low-risk ways.\nOnline high-yield savings accounts:You will earn virtually nothing on your cash for upcoming expenses and emergencies if you park that money in traditional brick-and-mortar bank savings accounts. The average interest rate on those is just 0.6%, according to Bankrate.\nBut you can earn north of 4% by depositing that money in an online high-yield savings account atFDIC-insured banks. The average rate this week is 4.14%, per Bankrate, but you can find rates as high as 4.40% or 4.50%. Inflation, by contrast,came in at 2.8%in February.\nCertificates of deposit:If you feel comfortable locking up your money for a relatively short period \u2014 for example, anywhere from three months to a few years \u2014you might benefit from a bank CD or a CD ladder. Among the variety on offer at Schwab.com this week, the average rates were between 4.15% and 4.45%. Note, though, if you take the money out before the CD term ends, you may pay a penalty.\nInterest you earn on CDs is treated as taxable income at the federal, state and local levels.\nRelated articleMarket losses early in retirement can increase your risk of outliving your money. But you can take steps to mitigate that\nUS Treasuries:A very low-risk way to earn competitive returns in the short run is to invest in short-term Treasury bills, with varying maturities between 4 weeks and 1 year; and in intermediate term Treasury notes, with maturities between two and 10 years.\nThese are investments backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, rates on Treasurys with maturities ranging from 3 months to five years were between 4.01% and 4.29%, according to Schwab.com.\nInterest earned on Treasuries is exempt from state and local taxes, so may be a good option if you live in a high-tax area. Taxation gets a bit more complicated if you sell a Treasury before it matures, which can trigger a capital gain or loss, on top of any interest income you make.\nMoney market funds:For Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar, a federal money market fund with a low-cost provider offers an easy, low-stress way to get the best cash yields on offer.\nMoney market funds typically invest in short-term, highly liquid assets like Treasuries and bank CDs. The average variable rate on such funds was 4.14% as of Tuesday, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index.\nKeep in mind, money market funds are not FDIC-insured. But if you purchase one through a registered broker-dealer that is insured through theSecurities Investor Protection Corporation, you will be covered for up to $500,000 should your brokerage fail and you can\u2019t recover all your assets when the firm liquidates.\nAAA-rated municipal bonds:Another tax-advantaged investment that offers inflation-beating returns are high-quality municipal bonds issued by state and local governments. Rates this week averaged between 2.65% and 3.36% on AAA-rated munis with maturities between  three months and five years, according to Schwab.com.\nInterest from munis is typically exempt from federal income tax. And it also may be exempt from state income taxes too if you buy one issued by the state where you live.\nEven if the Fed cuts rates later this year, as many expect, how much of a difference that will make depends on the type of debt you have and the amount you owe.\nCredit cards:The average rate on credit cards was 20.09% as of March 12, according to Bankrate. That is less than the 20.35% registered in mid-December, even farther below the record high of 20.79% set in August of 2024. But it is still in nose-bleed territory.\nThat\u2019s why Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at Lending Tree,recommends transferring your debt to a 0% balance transfer card if you can. That will buy you up to 18 months of no interest payments, during which time you can make big strides in paying down your principal. If that isn\u2019t an option, try for a lower-rate personal loan.\nOr simpler still: Call your credit card issuer and ask for a lower rate. A Lending Tree survey found that strategy works for three-quarters of those who try. And they got their rates knocked down by an average of 6 percentage points. \u201cThat\u2019s a really big deal and a far bigger decrease than you\u2019ll ever see from the Fed,\u201d Schulz said in an email.\nHome loans:The fixed-rate 30-year mortgage averaged 6.65% for the week ending March 13, according to Freddie Mac. That is down a little from the 6.74% registered in the same period a year ago.\nMortgage rates are tied directly to movement in the 10-year Treasury yield. Should the Fed projections anticipate a weaker economy later this year, that could mean more rate cuts, said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage.\nRelated articleWith the CFPB weakened, could risky lending make a comeback?\nIf you\u2019re planning to borrow against your home, variable rate home equity lines of credit or fixed-rate home equity loans have average interest rates north of 8%, according to Bankrate.\nWhile that\u2019s not cheap, it is considerably less expensive than incurring credit card debt for a home-related expense, or using an unsecured personal loan, with an average rate north of 12% as of March 12.\nBut there are a lot of ifs between now and the second half of the year. So your best bet is to shop for the best loan rate.\n\u201cNegotiating probably won\u2019t get your rates down to where they were a few years ago, but the savings can still be significant \u2014 even tens of thousands of dollars on a mortgage,\u201d Schulz said. \u201cThat money you save can then go toward other goals like building an emergency fund, saving for retirement or college or even starting a small business. It is absolutely worth your time.\u201d\nIf you want to use a HELOC as an emergency lifeline \u2014 which you may never tap \u2014 the rate may be less of a concern. But ask what costs are associated with it, such as closing costs, minimum withdrawal requirements, annual fees or inactivity fees.\nCar loans:Auto loan rates have actually increased a little this year, with the average climbing to 11.3% for used cars in February; and to 7.2% for new cars, according to car siteEdmunds.com.\nThe interest rate you get on a car loan will depend on your credit score and the length of your loan. Typically, the higher your score and the shorter your term, the lower the rate you can secure, per Bankrate.\nBut given the Trump administration\u2019s intention toimpose tariffs on cars and car partsimported to the United States as soon as April \u2014 not to mention tariffs on steel and aluminum \u2014 getting a car loan may be a harder decision than usual.\nIf tariffs do go through, expect to pay (and borrow) even more for a car. As it is, the average amount being financed today for a new car is already $41,585, said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.com. As for the loan rate, automakers will be less likely to offer you lower-rate financial incentives to buy their car because they might not be able to afford it anymore. And, she added, used car prices will rise, too, because demand for them will go up as people seek to avoid prohibitively higher prices on new cars.\nIf you have an existing loan at a very high rate (think 15% or more, Caldwell said) and your credit score is now much better than when you got the loan, it may be worth it to refinance. Butdo the math first. That\u2019s because a full percentage point drop in your rate might only save you less than $20 a month on a $35,000 loan, according to Bankrate. And you will have to pay fees to refinance.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/19\/business\/fed-interest-rate-your-savings-and-debts","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Europe saw faster economic growth early this year but Trump\u2019s tariffs have dimmed its prospects","date":"2025-04-30","body":"Europe\u2019s economy grew more strongly in the first three months of the year, only to see hopes for an ongoing recovery quickly squelched by US President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war.\nGross domestic product in the 20 countries that use the euro grew 0.4% in the first quarter, improving on 0.2% growth in the last part of 2024, according to official figures released Wednesday.\nBut on April 2, just two days after the end of the quarter, Trump announced an onslaught of new tariffs on almost every US trading partner and hit goods imported from the European Union with a 20% tariff rate. That has led to widespread downgrading of Europe\u2019s economic growth outlook for the year since its economy is heavily dependent on exports and the United States is its largest single export destination.\nAlthough Trump has announced a 90-day pause on what he calls his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 so named because they are based on how he feels other countries have been treating the US \u2014 prospects that the EU can strike a bargain to reduce the 20% figure are highly uncertain.\nRelated articleTrump\u2019s trade war will hit global and US prosperity hard, IMF warns\nMeanwhile, other tariffs \u2014 such as a 25% rate on steel and aluminum and on cars, both of them for all trading partners, including Europe \u2014 remain in place. The costs of tariffs are paid by the companies that import European goods such as cars and pharmaceuticals, which then have to decide whether to swallow the costs or pass them on to the consumer in the form of higher prices.\nAs a result, indicators of business and consumer optimism in Europe have fallen. The European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator sagged to 93.6 in March, its lowest level since December. That drop in sentiment is \u201canother illustration of how the last four weeks of tariff tensions and uncertainty have entirely wiped out the tentative return of optimism in the eurozone,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macroeconomics at ING bank.\n\u201cUnless there are major changes in US trade policy, sentiment as well as economic activity in the eurozone will remain subdued over the coming months,\u201d Brzeski said.\nBefore Trump\u2019s announcement, hopeful signs had included a strong job market, with unemployment low at 6.1% and consumers beginning to spend more after several years of holding back because of inflation.\nWith inflation down to 2.2%, the European Central Bank has been lowering the cost of credit for consumers and businesses by cutting its benchmark interest rate seven times in its current easing cycle,most recentlyby a quarter of a percentage point on April 17.\nOn top of that, the German parliament hasapproveda \u20ac500 billion ($570 billion) investment fund that\u2019s exempt from the country\u2019s constitutional limits on debt.

{"title":"So long, peak oil: World demand could now grow until 2050, a top agency says","date":"2025-11-12","body":"Global demand for oil and natural gas could grow until 2050, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, departing from previous expectations of a speedy transition to cleaner fuels following UScriticism of its climate focus.\nThe IEA also predicted in its annual outlook that the world would likely fail to meet its goal to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change.\nThe Paris-based energy security watchdog has been under pressure from the United States for a shift in recent years toward a focus on clean energy policies as President Donald Trump called on American companies to expand oil and gas production.\nDuring the Biden administration, the IEA predicted that global oil demand would peak this decade and said there should be an end to investment in new oil, gas and coal projects if the world wanted to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century.\nTrump\u2019s Energy Secretary Chris Wright has called the IEA\u2019s demand peak projections \u201cnonsensical.\u201d The agency is funded by member countries, with the US the largest contributor.\nIn its World Energy Outlook published Wednesday, the IEA predicted that under a \u201ccurrent policies scenario\u201d oil demand would hit 113 million barrels per day by mid-century, up around 13% from 2024 consumption.\nThe scenario \u2013 which the IEA first used in 2019 before switching to one more in line with a clean energy transition \u2013 is based on existing government policies and not aspirations to achieve climate goals.\nIEA head Fatih Birol said on a press call the scenario had been restored to reflect differing choices governments were making about energy.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has previously disputed peak oil demand forecasts.\n\u201cWe hope\u2026 we have passed the peak in the misguided notion of \u2018peak oil.\u2019\u201d OPEC said on its website Wednesday.\nIn the IEA\u2019s \u201cstated policies scenario,\u201d which considers proposed but not necessarily adopted policies, oil demand peaks around 2030.\nThe agency says its scenarios explore a range of possible outcomes under various sets of assumptions and are not forecasts.\nFinal investment decisions for new liquefied natural gas projects have surged in 2025, the report noted. Operations for about 300 billion cubic meters of new annual LNG export capacity will start by 2030, marking a 50% increase in available supply.\nBased on the current policies scenario, the global LNG market increases from around 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035 and to 1,020 bcm in 2050, driven by rising power sector demand fueled by data center and artificial intelligence growth.\nGlobal investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion in 2025, the report said, noting that if achieved this would surpass the $540 billion a year spent globally on oil supply.\nThe report includes a scenario describing a pathway to reduce global energy emissions to net zero by 2050.\nMore than 190 countries pledged at the Paris climate talks in 2015 to try to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nBut the report shows the world surpassing that in all scenarios.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/12\/business\/oil-demand-2050-iea-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"China posts unexpectedly strong economic growth before tariffs bite","date":"2025-04-15","body":"Chinahas posted unexpectedly strong economic growth in the first three months of 2025, before the full force of US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect, and sent an upbeat message about how it plans to weather an ongoing trade war with Washington.\nGrowth in China\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) hit 5.4% in the first quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That was considerably higher than the expectations of more than 50 economists surveyed by Reuters, who had predicted expansion of 5.1%, and continues a recent run ofsurprisingly strongexport-driven growth seen at the end of 2024.\n\u201cThe national economy had a steady and good start, continuing the upward trend,\u201d Sheng Laiyun, deputy director of the NBS, told a news conference. \u201cHowever, we must also see that the current external environment is becoming more complex and severe, and the effective domestic demand growth momentum is insufficient.\u201d\nGrowth in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, is in the spotlight as it deals with the fallout of an escalatingtrade war with the United States. And that\u2019s on top of the economic problems it has faced for years: a crisis in the property sector, the specter of falling prices and a reluctance among consumers to spend.\nThe data announced by the NBS covers growth in the first quarter, a particularly eventful time for US-China trade relations. Duringthat period, Trump imposed two rounds of tariffs totaling 20% on China related to fentanyl.\nThe figures do not include the impact of Trump\u2019s additional \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on Chinese imports, which took effect in April. The overall tariffs on China now exceed a staggering 145%.\nAsked about the impact of the tariffs, Sheng noted thatChina opposes the US tariff barriers and \u201ctrade bullying.\u201d While the tariffs will bring \u201ccertain pressure\u201d to bear on the Chinese economy, they \u201ccannot change the general trend of China\u2019s continued long-term economic improvement,\u201d he said.\n\u201cChina\u2019s economic foundation is stable, resilient and has great potential, so we have the courage, ability and confidence to cope with external challenges and achieve the established development goals,\u201d Sheng added.\nConsumer spending and production also beat expectations, with retail sales rising by 5.9% in March compared with the same month last year, and factory output expanding by 7.7% last month compared with 5.9% in the January to February period.\nLast month, Beijing set anambitious targetof \u201caround 5%\u201d growth for this year, in a defiant show of confidence in its export-driven economy. However, economists believe it will be tough to meet this target.\nThis is in part because export growth has been particularly buoyant since the waning months of 2024, when overseas companies increased their orders in anticipation of tariffs to be imposed by Trump.\nExperts believe exports, which surged by 12.4% in March compared with the year before, will not be able to maintain that strong momentum in the coming months because of the triple-digit levies.\n\u201cWe think the tariff shock poses unprecedented challenges to China\u2019s exports and will set forth major adjustment in the domestic economy as well,\u201d UBS economists led by Tao Wang wrote in a Tuesday research note.\nThey have downgraded their economic growth forecast for 2025 to 3.4% from 4%, with the assumption that the bilateral tariffs remain, and that Beijing will eventually announce additional stimulus measures.\nLast week, investment bank Goldman Sachs said the US tariffs will \u201csignificantly weigh\u201d on the Chinese economy. It has downgraded its GDP growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 to 4% and 3.5%, respectively, from previous projections of 4.5% and 4%.\nZichun Huang, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a Wednesday research note that the government is likely to announce more measures to strengthen domestic consumption in the coming months, which she said should be enough to keep growth above 4%.\n\u201cThe budget announced in March allows for a further ramp up in fiscal spending. And further monetary easing is likely to happen soon,\u201d she said, referring to spending by government and moves by the central bank to make borrowing more accessible.\nLike Chinese leaders at the opening of China\u2019s parliament last month, Sheng has sought to project optimism in the country\u2019s ability to stay the course, despite mounting trade pressure from the world\u2019s largest economy and its mercurial president.\nSheng pointed out to reporters that China has been diversifying its trading relationships beyond the US since the first trade war with the US. China\u2019s exports to the US as a percentage of total overseas shipments dropped from 19.2% in 2018, to 14.7% in 2024, he added.\n\u201cA diversified market pattern is taking shape, which also means that our dependence on a single export market in a certain country is declining,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, China\u2019s foreign trade is relatively resilient. The just-released first-quarter foreign trade data also shows that despite the increase in external restrictions, exports still grew by 6.9%.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, BeijingnamedLi Chenggang to the position of international trade negotiation representative and vice commerce minister. He replaced Wang Shouwen, who had played a major role in trade negotiations during Trump\u2019s first term.\nChina is going on a global charm offensive to promote itself as a more politically and economically stable partner than the United States. Chinese leader Xi Jinping is currently on aweek-long tourof Southeast Asia with that mission in mind.\nAs a bloc, the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations overtook the US and the European Union as China\u2019s largest export market in 2023. In meetings with Vietnam\u2019s top leadership on Monday, Xi said the two countries should work together to maintain \u201cthe stability of the global free trade system and industrial and supply chains,\u201daccording toChinese state news agency Xinhua.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and context.\nCNN\u2019s Hassan Tayir contributed reporting.\n.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/15\/business\/china-economy-growth-q1-hnk-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"China\u2019s economy grows more than expected. But fears of Trump tariffs loom","date":"2025-01-16","body":"China\u2019s economy grew more than expected in the last three months of 2024, official data showed on Friday, as it awaits the likely imposition of fresh tariffs by US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next week.\nMuch of the growth momentum came from exports, which propelled the country\u2019strade surplusto a record high of just under $1 trillion last year. That strength, though, is likely to draw the ire of Trump, who has said China will face higher tariffs on its goods, by 10% above any existing tariffs, until it prevents the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. On the campaign trial, he had threatened upwards of 60% on all Chinese imports to the US.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) separately revealed that China, which is struggling with demographic and economic problems, also notched a surprise increase in the birth rate last year, reversing a trend of declines that intensified from 2017. But the overall population continued to decline for a third year.\nIn the fourth quarter, the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 5.4%. That\u2019s considerably stronger than the 5.0% forecast by a group of economists polled by Reuters and represents an acceleration from the 4.6% pace posted in the third quarter.\nAs for the full year, growth came in at 5.0%, a shade higher than the 4.9% predicted by the Reuters poll. Goldman Sachs analysts said the quarterly growth data and last month\u2019s industrial production numbers beat expectations \u201cmeaningfully,\u201d but weaknesses remain.\nThey anticipate that growth will slow to 4.5% this year \u201cas the growth drag from likely higher US tariffs may more than offset the ongoing policy easing amid the prolonged property downturn and still-weak consumer sentiment,\u201d they wrote in a research note.\nEconomic momentum did pick up in the last few months of 2024, after the Chinese leadership finally decided to go ahead with a much-needed stimulus package, mostly focused on monetary measures, in the last week of September.\nSince then, policymakers have made a series of other moves \u2014 including a 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion)debt packageto help local governments, interest rate cuts and theexpansion ofa \u201ccash-for-clunkers\u201d scheme for household goods such as rice cookers \u2014 to boost growth.\nMany experts believe much more needs to be done to light a fire under the country\u2019s vast population of consumers, who have been sitting on the sidelines after suffering a massive loss of wealth from the continuing housing slump, which amounted to an estimated $18 trillion, according to investment bank Barclays.\nIn fact, some believe the imminent return of Trump and his possible sky-high tariffs may be just what is needed to jolt the Chinese leadership into taking more action.\nBeijing has shown that \u201cthey will do whatever it takes to offset the impact of tariffs,\u201d Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, said in a Wednesday research note. \u201cStrong tariffs result in strong stimulus and thus better domestic demand.\u201d\nChina is contending with a slew of pressures, including a severe property crisis, which has eroded consumer wealth and hurt household spending, and a demographic challenge, expected to have significant implications on future growth.\nLast year, the country recorded 6.77 births per 1,000 people, up from 6.39 a year earlier, according to the NBS. Some 9.54 million babies were born, an increase of more than half a million from 2023.\nThis is the first time China has recorded an increase in newborns since 2016, when the country saw a brief uptick in births following the relaxation of its decades-long one child policy.\nThe small rebound comes after the government has rolled out a raft of measures to nudge young people to have more children, from extending maternity leaves and offering financial incentives to improving childcare services. 2024 was also the Year of the Dragon on the Chinese lunar calendar, an especially auspicious year for having babies.\nBut the overall population has fell by 1.39 million to 1.408 billion in 2024, continuing a decline since 2022 that saw China replaced by India as the world\u2019s most populous nation.\nChina\u2019s working population, classified as those between the ages of 16 and 59, also declined by 6.83 million last year, adding to an ongoing contraction. The population of those over 60, meanwhile, continued to expand to account for 22% of the total population.\nThe rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce pose a severe challenge to China\u2019s economic and social stability, as it grapples with funding health care and pensions for elderly citizens while aiming to maintain growth.\nIn 2015, China announced an end to its decades-long one-child policy, allowing couples to have two children, then increased that to three children in 2021. But birth rates have continued to drop after a brief uptick.\nThe government has also vowed to promote a \u201cnew-era marriage and childbearing culture\u201d by encouraging young people to get married and give birth at an \u201cappropriate age\u201d and share responsibility for childcare.\nSo far, these policies have largely failed to convince young adults, who are grappling with high unemployment, rising living costs and a lack of social welfare support amid the economic slowdown. Many are postponing marriage and childbirth, and a growing number of young people even choose to eschew them entirely.\nThis story has been updated with additional information and context.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/16\/economy\/china-economy-growth-fourth-quarter-hnk-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Some people are still recovering from the last one","date":"2025-03-21","body":"The odds of a recession in the US may becreeping higher\u2014 but those rising risks do not mean a deep economic downturn is a foregone conclusion.\nStill, that hasn\u2019t stopped markets from beingroiledand consumer and business confidence from being shaken, especially after President Donald Trumpsaid he can\u2019t rule out the possibilityof such an event, or when Cabinet members indicated that a\u201cdetox period\u201dis ahead and that the administration\u2019s sweeping policies \u2014 including steep tariffs, mass deportations and drastic cutbacks in federal employment and spending \u2014 would be\u201cworth it,\u201deven if they trigger a recession.\nResearch shows, however, that recessions can have deeplynegative consequencesfor people, businesses and communities that are not only long lasting but, in some cases, irreversible.\n\u201cWhat do we get from recessions? We get unemployment, we get lower incomes, we get debt default, we get increases in alcohol and drug abuse, psychological problems,\u201d John Harvey, professor of economics at Texas Christian University, told CNN in an interview.\nRelated articleScott Bessent: \u2018I can\u2019t guarantee\u2019 America will avoid a recession\nWhileno two recessions are exactly alike, they do share some commonalities, according to theInternational Monetary Fund: They last about a year; economic output, consumption and trade activity decline; unemployment jumps; housing and equity values are eroded; financial markets experience turmoil; and inflation slows amid curtailed demand.\nWhile the impacts of such a downturn can vary widely, typically lower-income people are hit the hardest, and existing disparities only widen, said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.\n\u201cDisproportionately, it tends to be those most historically disadvantaged workers that are batted around more in a bad labor market, and they experience much higher rates of unemployment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think about young people, who are also harmed in downturns \u2014 the last-hired, first-fired kind of phenomenon.\u201d\nThe effects can be especially damaging and long lasting for people just entering the labor market \u2014 including recent graduates and middle-aged workers \u2014 during a recession, said Hannes Schwandt, a health economist and economic demographer who\u2019s closely studied those outcomes.\nFor example, during the 1981-1982 recession, the labor market entrants at the time not only experienced reductions in wages in the short term \u2014 an effect that was even more exacerbated for non-White workers \u2014 but they also suffered poorer economic, social and health outcomes in the decades that followed, according to Schwandt\u2019s research.\nIn addition to lower long-term earnings, \u201cyou see lower marriage rates, higher divorce rate, lower-income spouses\u201d and fewer children, he said. \u201cAnd then in the mid-30s to late 30s, we start to see health impacts arise, disability rates increase and then we even see mortality rates increasing.\u201d\n\u201cThe lifespan is shorter for those cohorts,\u201d he added.\nWhile there are arguments that business cycle fluctuations and downturns can carry silver linings for some individuals or economic outcomes, these events come at the cost of others\u2019 pain and hardship, Schwandt said.\n\u201cWhen it comes to the cost of these temporary fluctuations, we do see that certain groups are hit much more permanently,\u201d he added.\nRecessions have been shown to set back workers\u2019 earning potential for years, Gould said.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you graduate into a recession and you can\u2019t get a job in the field that you have studied and you have a lot of college debt,\u201d she noted. \u201cIt can be very damaging to be able to get on the right track and get your career off the ground.\u201d\nThat was the case for Laura Natale.\nShe graduated from the University of Portland in May 2008 with a slew of federal and private student loans and entered a labor market where hiring was slumping to record lows.\nRelated articleSo, what is stagflation, anyway, and why is it so scary?\n\u201cI got a job at a call center, and I was making $13 an hour,\u201d she said. \u201cThe student loans started back up (six months after graduation), and they were expecting $1,300 a month. I defaulted.\u201d\nAs the recession deepened and unemployment shot higher, the interest and the penalties on Natale\u2019s loans compounded much faster than her ability to move up the ladder to higher paying jobs.\n\u201cI\u2019d work my ass off and come home, pay all my bills, and I\u2019d have $100, maybe $200 left for the month for groceries, gas, everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cI never had a savings that was worth a damn. I was saving to pay my rent, and it was paycheck to paycheck.\u201d\nNearly 17 years later, Natale has a good job and is happy with her work-life balance, but the remaining student loan debt still looms large, and the effects of the Great Recession still linger.\n\u201cHad it not been a recession, I think the options would have been a lot greater,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me years to get to a point of being able to get anything on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that was worthy of getting a $30,000-a-year job.\u201d\nThe Great Recession was so deep and the financial crisis so significant that it took years for the economy to fully rebound.\nIt was hard for people to get back on track, Gould said.\n\u201cI think that we learned that austerity is what really held back the recovery,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the pandemic recovery, that was not what was pursued, and that\u2019s why we had such a fast bounce-back.\u201d\nAnd the wave of cutbacks being made and proposed at the federal level could ultimately weaken the very programs that are designed to help people in times of need, EPI\u2019s Gould said.\nRelated article\u2018\u2018Delete\u2019 is one of their favorite terms\u2019: Inside DOGE\u2019s IRS takeover ahead of tax season\n\u201cSo many people are living paycheck to paycheck, and this administration is looking at all sorts of cuts to the safety net, and that\u2019s particularly concerning,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re required to have a job (as a qualification for benefits), and you can\u2019t find a job no matter what you do \u2014 if the unemployment rate shoots up through no fault of your own \u2014 getting a job to be able to secure those benefits, it\u2019s just an impossibility.\u201d\nTo that end, the current austerity approach being undertaken by the Trump administration could spell trouble both for current economic health as well as the ability to recover if things go south, said Harvey, the economist at Texas Christian University.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s focusing on the trade, the tariffs; but to me, the far scarier thing is cutting all this government spending,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a cupping and bleeding kind of medicine from the Middle Ages \u2014 that we need to suffer to end up with some sort of positive outcome.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cAnd it\u2019s simply not true: Suffering just creates suffering.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/21\/economy\/recession-negative-outcomes-long-lasting","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"UK\u2019s unpopular government delivers tax-raising budget after leak that outlined its main plans","date":"2025-11-26","body":"Britain\u2019s unpopular center-left Labour government sought to seize the political narrative Wednesday with a tax-raising budget that it hopes will boost economic growth, reduce child poverty and ease cost-of-living pressures.\nBut the chaos that has engulfed the government during weeks of mixed messaging and political infighting continued up to the final moment. The entire contents of the budget were leaked half an hour before Treasury chief Rachel Reeves delivered the budget statement in the House of Commons.\nThe government was elected in a landslide victory in July 2024 on a promise not to raise taxes on income for working people, and Reeves acknowledged that some of the budget\u2019s \u00a326 billion ($34 billion) in tax hikes broke the spirit of that pledge and would face criticism.\nBut, she said, \u201cI have yet to see a credible or a fairer alternative plan for working people.\n\u201cThese are my choices \u2013 the right choices for a fairer, a stronger, and a more secure Britain,\u201d she said.\nThe biggest change in terms of money raised is freezing the thresholds at which earners pay Britain\u2019s different tax levels for a further three years from 2028, meaning as wages rise, more people fall into higher tax brackets.\nOther measures included a mansion tax, changes to the capital gains tax regime, higher gambling taxes, a new levy on electric car use and a cut to tax-free provisions for private pensions.\nReeves also abolished a much-hated cap on benefits paid out to families with more than two children. She also announced measures to ease the financial pressure on households, by freezing rail fares and cutting levies on household energy bills.\nBritain is one of the world\u2019s richest countries. So why do a third of its children live in poverty?\nOverall, the budget was strikingly similar to Reeves\u2019 first budget a little more than a year ago, even though she insisted at the time that it would be the one and only big tax-raising budget in this parliamentary term, due to run to 2029.\nUnfortunately for Reeves, the UK economy, the world\u2019s sixth-largest, isn\u2019t doing as well as she hoped, with many critics blaming her decision last year to slap taxes on business. Though there were signs the economy was improving in the first half of the year, when it was the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, it has faltered again.\nBritain\u2019s public finances, like those of other nations, have been squeezed in recent years by the costs of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. The United Kingdom bears the extra burden of Brexit, which has knocked billions off the economy since the country left the European Union in 2020.\nMeanwhile, Reeves has a bunch of spending commitments aimed at easing the cost of living as inflation remains stubbornly high, including making up for a series of about-faces on planned welfare cuts.\nThe budget followed weeks of messy mixed messaging and political acrimony that continued into the minutes before Reeves stood in the House of Commons.\nOn November 4, Reeves made a speech to prepare the public and markets for a hike in income tax rates, which would break a key election promise. After an outcry among Labour lawmakers, and a better-than-expected update on public finances, she reversed course, opting for a smorgasbord of smaller revenue-raising measures.\nThen, the entire fiscal forecast from the independent watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), including details of the budget\u2019s main measures, was published online half an hour before Reeves\u2019 statement.\nReeves said the early release was \u201cdeeply disappointing and a serious error\u201d by the budget watchdog.\nThe OBR blamed a \u201ctechnical error\u201d for the leak, saying it went \u201clive on our website too early this morning.\u201d It said it will report to all relevant authorities, including the Treasury, as to what happened.\nThe budget is a high-stakes moment for Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is facing mounting concern from Labour lawmakers over his dire poll ratings. Opinion polls consistently put Labour well behind the hard-right Reform UK party led by Nigel Farage.\nThe next election doesn\u2019t have to be held until 2029, and the government continues to hope that its economic measures will spur higher growth and ease financial pressures.\nBut speculation is swirling about a potential challenge to Starmer\u2019s leadership from within his party, and analysts say a misfiring budget could add to the sense of crisis within the government.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/26\/economy\/uk-budget-leak-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Jeff Merkley, ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\u201cRepublicans can\u2019t ignore the trillions of dollars this bill adds to the deficit, and they can\u2019t ignore the interest that comes along with the massive debt they are creating,\u201d the Oregon Democrat said in a statement. \u201cIt is fiscally irresponsible.\u201d\nMoody\u2019s Ratingsdowngradedthe creditworthiness of US debt last month, in part because of the increase in government debt and interest payment ratios.\nTrump and House GOP leaders have already sought to undercut the CBO\u2019s projections, arguing that nonpartisan agency has missed the mark in the past and that its analyses don\u2019t properly account for the economic growth that would result from the tax breaks. They have made similar claims about estimates from independent groups that also project a big hit to the deficit, even when including the current bill\u2019s effect on the economy.\nMinutes after the CBO released its analysis, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise attacked the agency, saying it is once again ignoring the business boom \u2013 and resulting revenue growth \u2013 that the package will spur.\n\u201cAnybody who repeats CBO\u2019s analysis is also making those same mistakes,\u201d he said at a House GOP press conference, adding that when the bill becomes law \u201cyou\u2019re going to see economic growth in this country like we haven\u2019t seen in generations, meaning more pay in the pockets of workers, and you\u2019re going to see more Treasury money coming in because of the growth of the American economy.\u201d\nThe CBO said an analysis that takes into account the economic effects of the legislation is forthcoming.\nWhile including the bill\u2019s economic impact may somewhat change the deficit projection, it wouldn\u2019t fundamentally alter it, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, citing several analyses by independent groups.\nSome Senate leaders are looking to dodge the question of the package\u2019s deficit impact by arguing that extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act should be considered a continuation of current policy, and, therefore, would not contribute to an increase in the deficit. The CBO analysis is based on the standard approach of current law, in which the tax cuts expire at the end of the year, so their extension would entail a cost.\nThe House package calls for making permanent essentially all of the individual income tax cuts contained in the 2017 tax cuts act. The bill would also temporarily provide tax relief to certain senior citizens and workers who earn tips and overtime, which Trumppromised on the campaign traillast year. And it would temporarily restore two TCJA tax breaks for businesses, including allowing them to immediately deduct the cost of research and development and equipment.\nTo help offset the cost of the tax relief, the House bill would enacthistoric cutsto Medicaid and food stamps, two of the nation\u2019s key safety net programs. The package would institutework requirements in Medicaid, which provides health insurance to low-income Americans, and would expand the work mandate in the food stamp program, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. These provisions would result in millions of people losing their access tohealth coverageandnutrition assistance, according to preliminary CBO projections released earlier.\nThe bill would also boost spending on defense, border security and immigration enforcement, which are among Trump\u2019s top priorities.\nThe House package would cut close to $1.3 trillion in spending over a decade, according to the CBO. But the legislation would lower revenue by nearly $3.7 trillion.\n\u201cWe\u2019re left with the bill that, despite all these tough choices, still is adding dramatically to the debt,\u201d Goldwein said.\nIndependent analyses show that the tax relief in the package would disproportionately benefit higher-income households, with the impact being even more pronounced if the spending cuts are considered. Those in the lowest income groups would see their incomes fall, after taxes and certain government benefits are taken into account, while the highest earners would enjoy an income boost, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model\u2019s estimate of the final House bill.\nSome 10.9 million more people would be uninsured in 2034 under the bill, CBO estimated. That includes 7.8 million Americans who would lose health insurance because of the Medicaid provisions and roughly 1.4 million people without verified citizenship or satisfactory immigration status who would not be covered in 2034 by health programs funded only with state dollars. Others would lose coverage because of the Affordable Care Act measures in the bill, including shortening the fall open enrollment period, restricting special enrollment periods during the year and increasing verification requirements for premium subsidies, among others.\n\u201cThis would be the biggest rollback in federal support for health care ever,\u201d Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the nonpartisan KFF,postedon X.\nIn addition, the House bill would not extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, which congressional Democrats and the Biden administration put in place in 2021. The beefed up subsidies are set to lapse at the end of the year.\nAllowing the enhancement to expire, combined with implementing an Obamacare rule proposed by the Trump administration, would increase the number of uninsured Americans by another 5.1 million in 2034, according to a separate CBO analysis conducted for congressional Democrats and released on Wednesday.\nDemocrats quickly sought to amplify the CBO\u2019s findings about the bill\u2019s impact.\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking House Republicans rushed to vote on this bill without an accounting from CBO on the millions of people who will lose their health care or the trillions of dollars it would add to the national debt,\u201d Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement.\n\u201cThe truth is Republican leaders raced to pass this bill under cover of night because they didn\u2019t want the American people or even their own members to know about its catastrophic consequences.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional details.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/04\/politics\/house-gop-big-beautiful-bill-increase-deficit","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"How the big, beautiful and expensive bill could cost you","date":"2025-05-22","body":"In the spring of 2020, America faced a once-in-a-century health crisis that crashed the economy and threatened the lives of millions. Republicans and Democrats came together to pass a forceful, and expensive,emergency responsethat helped prevent permanent scarring to the economy.\nToday, America\u2019smountain of debt is casting a shadowover Washington\u2019s financial capability to respond to the next emergency, whatever it might be.\nIn a future crisis, Congress may not have as much firepower to come to the rescue because the government is already saddled with $36 trillion of debt.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d would pile another $3.8 trillion to that mountain of debt. That kind of extra borrowing would only amplify growing concerns about America\u2019s unsustainable financial trajectory.\n\u201cThe US is heading in the wrong direction. This bill would be one more nail in the coffin of a country falling under an enormous debt burden,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, chief market strategist at Man Group, the world\u2019s largest listed hedge fund.\nThe federal government hit a telling milestone last fiscal year: For the first time ever, interest payments on the national debt exceeded the entire defense budget. Spending on interest hasmore than tripledsince 2017.\nRelated articleGood news! Prices are falling. But it might be for bad reasons\n\u201cThere\u2019s an argument that no great power can remain a great power if it spends more on interest than defense,\u201d said Hooper.\nWhile budget fights and deficit worries may seem arcane, there are real-world implications for what happens next.\nFirst, there\u2019s a risk that sky-high deficits will make it harder, and more expensive, for the federal government to come to the rescue in the next crisis, whether that\u2019s a health emergency, a financial meltdown, a war or something else.\nConsider thatUS debt-to-GDP, a closely watched gauge of a nation\u2019s leverage, stood at around 62% before the Great Recession began in 2007. Today it stands above 120% and is on track to continue growing.\nThe more leveraged that investors believe the federal government to be, the more they will likely demand in compensation in the form of higher interest rates. And that has significant consequences.\nMany Americans will feel the impact of these higher rates \u2014 including in their cost of living.\nThat\u2019s because US Treasuries serve as a critical benchmark that influences the cost of other forms of credit.\nThe higher Treasury rates go, the more expensive it will be to get a mortgage and achieve the American dream of homeownership.\nFor homeowners, higher rates mean more expensive home equity loans to upgrade, repair and improve the value of their existing homes.\nThe same is true for people who want to take out a car loan or pay down credit card debt.\n\u201cThe reason everyday Americans should care about fiscal sustainability is this is a long-running cost of living issue,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale and a former economist in the Biden White House.\nHigher rates will also make it more expensive for businesses to borrow money to expand and hire workers. That means fewer jobs and lower wages for Americans.\nThe other issue is that every $1 billion the federal government must pay on interest is $1 billion that could be going towards something most Americans care about, like education or fixing roads and bridges.\nSimply put, the more the government spends on interest, the less it has to invest in more productive uses.\nAnd, in the long run, economists say that will translate to a weaker economy and a lower standard of living.\nNot only that, but higher rates to service America\u2019s mountain of debt would likely weigh on the stock market. That\u2019s in part because boring government bonds would make stocks look more expensive in comparison.\nA weaker stock market makes it harder for Americans to build a nest egg for retirement, to save for their kids\u2019 college or have a rainy day fund for a financial emergency.\nHigher mortgage rates would similarly keep a lid on home values, hurting a key source of wealth for many families.\nThere\u2019s also the risk that, at some point, there would be a full-blown debt crisis in America where the debt load is so high that investors throw their hands up and say no more.\nWashington got a glimpse of what that might look like earlier this year when theso-called bond vigilantesrevoltedover Trump\u2019s sky-high tariffhikes, sending yields surging.Fears of a bond market catastrophehelped convince Trump to back down.\nRelated articleDow sinks 800 points as bond market starts to freak out over Trump\u2019s tax bill\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to live through a Greece- or Portugal-style meltdown. We\u2019re not close to that but we don\u2019t even want to play with that,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute.\nConcerns about the fiscal situationsparked a market sell-offon Wednesday. Investors demanded higher rates on US debt in a 20-year Treasury auction. That weak auction drove down US stocks, bonds and the dollar.\nTreasury rates climbed even higher on Thursday after the Housepassed the bill. That, in turn, drove down US stock futures.\nHoltz-Eakin, an economic adviser to President George W. Bush and former director of the CBO, said Congress must act because allowing the 2017 Trump tax cuts to expire would amount to a major tax hike that would hurt the US economy.\nYet Holtz-Eakin said there is a way to do that without further adding to the deficit.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to make things worse than current policy. This is a bad outcome,\u201d he said.\nThe White House has argued the sweeping legislation will essentially pay for itself by turbocharging growth and boosting wages.\nHowever, the House GOP bill would only slightly boost the US economy, adding 0.5% to gross domestic product over 10 years, according to an analysis by thePenn Wharton Budget Model. And yet the package would add an estimated $3.3 trillion to federal deficits over 10 years, the analysis found.\nNotably, House Republicans have not changed course even afterMoody\u2019s Ratings delivered a wake-up calllast week by removing the perfect credit rating it had kept on the United States since 1917.\nOf course, deficit hawks have been warning of trouble for years, if not decades.\nAnd yet the United States has been able to run large deficits and US debt is still viewed as one of the safest assets on the planet.\nThere is a risk of a boy-who-cried-wolf situation where concerns about the federal budget are not heeded.\n\u201cThe wolf is not at the door. The ants are in the woodwork, and they are eating at the foundation,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin. \u201cEvery year we are cutting away from our capacity to do better because we\u2019re borrowing so much.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/22\/economy\/trump-tax-bill-debt-deficit","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Americans are finding it harder and harder to pay off their debt","date":"2025-02-13","body":"Americans are having a harder timemanaging rising debtburdens and in some cases haven\u2019t been this overextended since the aftermath of the Great Recession.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Thursday released its latest comprehensive look at credit conditions for American households in major categories such as mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, home equity lines of credit and student loans.\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, overall debt levels increased by 0.5% to $18.04 trillion, according to theQuarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit.\nAll major loan categories tracked in the report saw increases as well. Credit card balances topped $1.2 trillion, rising 7.3% from the fourth quarter of last year and logging the smallest yearly increase since 2021.\nHigher levels of household debt are to be expected as they can reflect factors such as population growth, strong economic conditions, holiday-related spending and the rise of e-commerce.\nPlus, prices are significantly higher as inflation has run hot for nearly four years.\nHowever, Thursday\u2019s report also showed that Americans appear to be having more difficulty dealing with that debt \u2014 specifically for auto loans and credit cards.\nThe share of households becoming seriously delinquent (a missed payment for 90+ days) on their auto loans and credit cards are at 14-year highs.\nRelated articleUS wholesale prices remained high last month, a sign progress on inflation may have stalled\nThe increase in the percentage of loans transitioning into serious delinquency partly reflect the higher-balance loans that resulted from cars becoming significantly more expensive following the pandemic and related supply chain disruptions, New York Fed researchers noted.\n\u201cThe news about auto loan delinquencies is troubling,\u201d Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, said in commentary Thursday. \u201cMany Americans simply have to have a car to get to work, so that\u2019s often one of the highest priorities when paying bills. If they\u2019re struggling to make those payments, it could be a sign that they\u2019re struggling to make others as well.\u201d\nThat appears to be the case with credit cards. Last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphiareportedthat the share of credit card accounts where people made just the minimum payment climbed to 12-year high during the third quarter of 2024.\nThursday\u2019s report, which tracked activity for the fourth quarter, showed that transitions into early and serious credit card delinquency remained elevated.\nPlus, borrowers are taking up an increasingly greater share of available credit. Through the fourth quarter, overall credit card utilization rates climbed north of 23.8% for the first time since 2013, an analysis of New York Fed data shows.\nThose balances also are growing in an expensive environment for debt: Interest rates remain high.\nStill, overall delinquency rates remain below what was seen pre-pandemic. During the fourth quarter, they ticked up to 3.6% of outstanding debt in some stage of delinquency, according to the report.\nWhile debt balances are growing, it\u2019s worth noting that incomes have been on the rise as well, which have helped households manage their debt. In addition to the New York Fed data, economists closely watch a separately released gauge from the Federal Reserve \u2014 the household debt service ratio, which tracks debt payments as a percentage of after-tax income.\nThelatest Fed datashowed the ratio continues to increase but remains well below pre-pandemic levels. As of the third quarter of 2024, debt payments accounted for 11.3% of disposable income, which is the highest since the first quarter of 2020.\n\u201cAt the moment, household balance sheets are in pretty decent shape in the aggregate,\u201d Brett Ryan, senior economist at Deutsche Bank, told CNN in an interview. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s a large disparity across income groups, but the top 20% account for about 40% of consumer spending.\u201d\nAndconsumer spending, he said, remains solid.\nHowever, the latest data also indicates that things could turn for the worse in short order, noted Schulz.\n\u201cThis report feels like further proof that Americans are generally doing OK financially, but it wouldn\u2019t take much for things to go from pretty good to pretty scary,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf they were to face a job loss, medical emergency or some other big unexpected financial crisis, things could get tough in a big hurry.\u201d\nThat\u2019s been the case for Monica Chavez and her family.\nChavez, 38, is among thegrowing ranks of Americansexperiencing long-term unemployment as businesses \u2014particularly those in white-collar industries\u2014 have trimmed their workforces and drastically curtailed hiring.\nThe longtime corporate recruiter has been actively job hunting since May 2024, submitting hundreds of applications across a broad array of industries. She\u2019s had about 15 to 20 interviews as a result, made it to the second or third round on some, but ultimately didn\u2019t get the final call.\nAt the same time, the bills are piling up, adding to an increasingly untenable situation.\nHer fianc\u00e9 was injured and unable to continue running his small business.

{"title":"US to hit debt ceiling Tuesday, starting Congress\u2019 countdown clock","date":"2025-01-17","body":"The nation will hit its roughly $36 trilliondebt limiton Tuesday, when the Treasury Department will start taking extraordinary measures to allow the government to pay its bills, outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter to congressional leaders on Friday. The notice comes just three days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.\nReaching the cap ramps up pressure on congressional Republicans, but lawmakers have a little time before they must act to avoid a first-ever default, which would likely cause global economic upheaval. The extraordinary measures, which are mainly behind-the-scenes accounting maneuvers, will continue through March 14, Yellen wrote.\nAlthough Republicans control Capitol Hill, they remain divided over how to address thedebt ceiling. They have several major agenda items they want to push through Congress along party lines, including border security, energy and tax cuts, possibly in one package or two. Plus, lawmakers still must pass a government funding bill for fiscal year 2025, which began October 1. (Atemporary spending measureexpires on March 14.)\nA bill to increase or suspend the debt ceiling could be included in one of these packages, though addressing the cap has been a bipartisan effort in recent years.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is already running up againstresistancefrom some of his fiscally conservative members, who want to decrease the debt, not increase it. His super-slim majority will make it even more difficult for him to find a compromise \u2014 and he may need Democratic support in order to pass an increase to the limit.\nThe issue has already brought to light fissures within the party. In December, Trump demanded that lawmakers address the limit as part of a temporary spending bill. However, the GOP-led package, which included suspending the cap into January 2027,failedamid opposition that included a significant number of Republicans.\nGOP leaders in the House in December floated an idea to raise the debt limit by $1.5 trillion as part of a first reconciliation package in 2025. The legislation would also include $2.5 trillion in cuts to net mandatory spending, aimed at satisfying conservative members. But that would buy the caucus only limited time before they face the cap again, experts said.\nThe debt ceiling had been suspended until January 2 as part of the bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act, which Congress approved in June 2023 after months of contentious debate between the GOP-led House and Democrats who controlled the Senate and White House. Thecapat the time was $31.4 trillion.\nIn a technical quirk, the US didn\u2019t actually hit the limit on January 2 because the debt level was projected to dip that day due to the scheduled redemption of certain securities, Yellen told Congress in late December. At the time, she forecast the cap would be reached between January 14 and January 23.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/17\/business\/debt-ceiling-limit-congress","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Sweeping GOP budget bill illuminates the central fault line in the modern Republican coalition","date":"2025-06-22","body":"The sweeping Republican budget bill advancing through Congress illuminates the central fault line in the modern GOP electoral coalition more starkly than any legislation in decades.\nThe bill sharpens the GOP\u2019s long-standing tension between a political strategy that increasingly relies on financially squeezed working-class voters and an economic agenda that still funnels its greatest direct benefits to the affluent. The budget legislation makes that conflict unusually explicit because, for the first time in 30 years, the GOP has tied large spending cuts that willmostly hurt families below the median incomein the same bill with big tax cuts that mostly benefit families above it.\nIn the past, Republican tax bills \u201cwhere the benefits were more tilted toward the rich were not uncommon,\u201d said Harris Eppsteiner, associate director for economic analysis for the Budget Lab at Yale University. \u201cBut the thing that is unique here is that it is paired to cuts in the safety net that will leave folks at the bottom worse off.\u201d\nMore than any other single factor, Democrats are counting on a voter backlash against the budget bill \u2014 which passed the House earlier this month and is moving toward a floor vote maybe as soon as this week in the Senate \u2014 to power them to gains in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a powerful thing to be able to say they are cutting Medicaid and people\u2019s health care, popular programs, to fund a tax cut for the wealthiest people,\u201d said Nick Gourevitch, a Democratic pollster.\nRelated articleHow Trump\u2019s megabill transfers wealth in the US\nCongressional Republicans are already trying to build defenses against that argument. They are highlighting the aspects of the tax plan with the broadest populist appeal and presenting the bill\u2019s substantial cuts in Medicaid spending as a form of welfare reform that will preserve benefits for the neediest. Since the Ronald Reagan era, Republicans also have consistently shown that they can neutralize Democratic economic appeals to White blue-collar voters by painting the party as excessively liberal on cultural issues such as crime, immigration and LGBTQ rights.\nYet the magnitude of what Republicans are attempting with this single bill will test that record. Simultaneously, according to nonpartisan analyses, the bill could strip health insurance from at least 16 million Americans and significantly cut food assistance \u2014while also providing tax cuts worth over $100,000 annuallyto the top 0.1% of earners. Bobby Kogan, a former Senate Budget Committee aide who now analyzes fiscal policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, says that considering all its provisions, the legislation \u201cwould be the biggest transfer from the poor to the rich in a single bill in US history.\u201d\nAn early skirmish between Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska and a liberal advocacy group is previewing how the debate may play out next year over what Republicans, adopting President Trump\u2019s terminology, are calling their \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill.\u201d\nUnrig the Economy, the liberal advocacy group, has run radio and television ads in Bacon\u2019s Omaha district attacking him over his vote supporting the budget billwhen it passed the House in May. \u201cHe\u2019s actually cutting Medicaid so he can give tax breaks to big corporations and billionaires,\u201d an Omahawoman identified as Audrey declares in the television ad.\nThe argument that Republicans are taking health care from people who need it to fund tax cuts for people who don\u2019t is likely to be central in Democratic House and Senate campaigns next year. \u201cIt is key that both House and Senate Democrats continue to implement this message as far and wide as possible,\u201d the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wrote in a strategy memo released earlier this month.\nBacon,one of just three House Republicans left in districts that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, has previewed the likely GOP response to those arguments in his pushback against the advocacy group\u2019s ads. He\u2019s emphasized the portion of the bill\u2019s Medicaid changes adding work requirements.   \u201cWe expect if you\u2019re an able-bodied adult without children that you should be seeking a job or getting the skills to get another job or as a minimum, volunteering 20 hours a week,\u201dBacon said in a press call with local reporters earlier this month.\nRepublicans yoked the tax and spending cuts into one billlargely to satisfy hardline House conservativeswho were complaining that the tax plan   dangerously inflated the federal deficit and debt.\nBut in choosing to pair the tax and spending cuts, the GOPconspicuously departedfrom its strategy for the tax cuts it passed under Presidents George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 and Trump in 2017. Each of those bills offered sugar without spinach: They cut taxes without reducing spending. The last time the GOP pursued tax and spending cuts in the same bill was in 1995, when the aggressive \u201cRepublican Revolution\u201d Congress led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich precipitated an intense fiscal battle with then-President Bill Clinton.\nIn the debates over the earlier GOP tax cuts, Democrats argued that the plans primarily benefited the rich and, by depleting federal revenues, wouldeventuallyforce cuts in programs for average families. But by choosing to cut taxes and programs simultaneously, Republicans this year have eliminated any conjecture, allowing analysts to assess the plan\u2019s combined impact on families at different points on the income scale.\nThose analyses have returned a consistent verdict on the bill\u2019s winners and losers. Boththe Congressional Budget Officeand thebudget model developed by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, found that families on the lowest rungs of the income ladder would lose more from the spending cuts than they would gain from the tax savings; the CBO calculated that most families earning up to about $76,000 annually would come out net losers from the bill. Middle-to upper middle-class families, both analyses found, would see relatively small net benefits. Only those at the top would see big gains: CBO calculated the top 10% of earners would average about $12,000 in additional annual income from the bill, while the Penn Wharton model found that the top 0.1% would net over $103,000 annually.\nKogan said that no previous legislation careened to such extremes on both ends. He\u2019s calculated that compared with the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d the 1995 Gingrich budget sought deeper cuts in programs for the needy but didn\u2019t provide such generous tax breaks to the rich; the famous 1981 Reagan budget plan (which was separated into two bills) cut taxes more for the rich, but programs for the poor less. With bigger program cuts than Reagan and bigger tax cuts than Gingrich, Kogan says, this bill redistributes wealth up the income ladder more than either of them.\nWhen congressional Republicans previously married tax and spending cuts into a single bill did not end well for them. In that 1995 confrontation, Clinton won the battle for public opinion, reviving his foundering presidency and propelling him toward an easy reelection in 1996. Clinton prevailed by stressing the argument Democrats are echoing today: Republicans are cutting programs that benefit average Americans to fund tax cuts for the rich.\nAs in 1995, the GOP budget plan isfacing widespread public skepticism. Substantially more Americans said they opposed than supported the bill in recent national polls by the non-partisanPew Research CenterandKFF thinktank, as well as inWashington Post\/Ipsos,Fox News, andQuinnipiac Universitysurveys.\nThough the Senate is considering changes to the House-passed legislation, both bills are built around the same two pillars: extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts for all earners and offsetting that cost primarily by cutting federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.\nBoth of those pillars stand on shaky ground with the public. In the Washington Post\/Ipsos survey, a majority of Americans opposed extending the tax cuts for those earning over $400,000 annually. Both that survey and the KFF poll also found that significant majorities   opposed health care cuts that would cause a significant rise in the uninsured. Only about 1 in 5 in the KFF poll said they expected the bill to help the middle-class; half thought it would hurt average families.\nThe GOP\u2019s challenge in selling this package is even more complicated than in 1995 because of changes in their electoral coalition. Compared with that era,Republicans today are much more reliant on working-class voters without a four-year degree\u2014 not only the white voters in that category, but also increasingly the blue-collar minorities who provided Trump\u2019s most important gains in the 2024 election.\nThat means many more GOP voters than in Gingrich\u2019s time rely on federal safety net programs. Looking at people who have purchased health care through the ACA,KFF foundthat more identify as Republicans than Democrats. Sixty-four House Republicans represent districts where theshare of adults on Medicaid exceeds the national average. Republicans hold 13 Senate seats across the 20 states that have insured the most people under theMedicaid expansion funded by the ACA\u2014 which is the principal target for both the House and Senate cuts. Medicaid funding is especially critical to hospitals in rural areas, which now vote overwhelmingly Republican.\nWhit Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster, says that targeting federal health care programs for such large reductions dangerously ignores the changes in the GOP\u2019s electoral base since the days when fiscal hawks such as former House Speaker Paul Ryan set the party\u2019s fiscal agenda.\n\u201cThe GOP coalition is dramatically different today than it was 10 years ago,\u201d Ayres said. \u201cThis looks like a bill that could have come out of a Paul Ryan House of Representatives rather than a Donald Trump House of Representatives.\u201d\nNeera Tanden, the former chief domestic policy adviser for former President Joe Biden and now the president of the Center for American Progress, frames the mismatch even more starkly: \u201cRepublicans are testing the proposition that there is nothing they can do to working class people to make them lose their support,\u201d she said.\nRepublicans may face particular vulnerability among the newest addition to their coalition: working-class minority voters without a college degree. The Washington Post\/Ipsos, Pew and KFF polls all found them expressing much greater concern about the bill than non-college Whites, who have been more solidly cemented into the GOP base for decades. In the KFF poll, over four-fifths of minorities without a college degree said Medicaid was very important to their community and nearly three-fifths said it was very important to their own families \u2014 far more than the share of non-college Whites who said the same. In both the KFF and Pew surveys, more than three times as many of those blue-collar minorities said they expected the bill to hurt than to help them.\nAgainst all these headwinds, Republicans have some potentially potent responses. The White Househas reportedly shared private polling with congressional Republicansshowing support for the bill\u2019s measures to end taxes on tips and overtime, and is also urging them to stress the plan\u2019s provisions punishing states that provide Medicaid to undocumented immigrants. In the KFF poll, two-thirds of Americans backed a work requirement for able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid, another central component of the GOP plan. Most voters were likewise receptive to the GOP case that reducing Medicaid spending on those adults would save money for the elderly, low-income children and people with disabilities.\nJason Cabel Roe, a Michigan-based Republican consultant, believes that it would have been better for the party to split the tax and spending cuts into separate bills, partly to make it harder for Democrats to link the two. But Roe believes public concern about the federal deficit and debt gives Republicans more leeway than Democrats believe to cut government programs \u2014 as long as the targets look justified.\n\u201cOur argument is we are going to get people off the dole who don\u2019t belong there \u2026 and if we are able to find the savings through that strategy, I think we can weather this line of attack from Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are real stories of people losing their Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans benefits, then we have a problem .\u201d\nYet as KFF President Drew Altmanwrote last week, the KFF poll also found that many voters were moved by Democratic counter-arguments, such as pointing out that most Medicaid recipients are already working, disabled, or caring for a family member.  Gourevitch and other Democratic strategists believe the party\u2019s enduring advantage on health care \u2014 one of the few issues on which the public consistently expresses more confidence in Democrats than Republicans \u2014 will give an advantage to their candidates in any campaign exchanges over the bill.\nAs Tanden pointed out, voters react to changes in health care policy more viscerally than most issues \u2014 a dynamic that has previously burned both parties. Revoking health insurance for millions of Americans would be a tough sell for the GOP at any point. But Republicans are creating a much more volatile compound by adding to the formula tax savings for the affluent that make the distribution of winners and losers in their plan unusually visible. \u201cThey are playing with live bombs here,\u201d Tanden said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/22\/politics\/congress-tax-spending-bill-medicaid-cuts-analysis","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"China used its trade juggernaut to withstand US tariffs. Can it keep its edge?","date":"2025-11-14","body":"As US duties on Chinese imports spun higher and higher earlier this year, Derek Wang braced for major disruption.\nWith US orders ground to a halt, Wang, 36, who sells intelligent cookware out of southern China\u2019s Guangdong province, looked elsewhere to fill the gap. After finding new buyers in Brazil, Japan, Malaysia and Cambodia, he learned what he describes as a key lesson: \u201cNothing is more important than the markets close to us.\u201d\nStories like Wang\u2019s have played out across China\u2019s vast economy where businesses, large and small, scrambled to fill the void after temporary triple-digit duties \u2013 and the threat of their return \u2013 upended Chinese exports to the world\u2019s wealthiest market.\nThe result has been a coup for China\u2019s trade juggernaut.\nInstead of seeing exports falter on lost US business, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer has driven them deeper into other markets around the world \u2013 building on the country\u2019s global economic footprint and hedges companies made during Trump\u2019s first trade war.\nThe resilience gave Beijing confidence in its months-long negotiations with the US, which came to a head in October when leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met and agreed to a truce that whittles new tariffs on Chinese goods down to 20%.\nBut the push also puts China on track to eclipse last year\u2019s gaping nearly $1 trillion global trade surplus \u2013 a balance that\u2019s irritated governments around the world and sparked Trump\u2019s trade war in the first place.\nThere were already questions about the sustainability of China\u2019s export blitz before data released last week showed exports unexpectedly contracted by just over 1% year on year in October \u2013 the first downturn since February.\nWhether China can maintain its level of exports to the rest of the world \u2013 and expand back into the US market after the recent truce, is a consequential question for the world\u2019s second-largest economy as it continues to struggle with lackluster demand from its own consumers, but doubles down on manufacturing as its economic cornerstone.\nSo far this year, the shift in China\u2019s export flows has been stark \u2013 and sent a clear message that, for China, the US is not irreplaceable.\nWhile exports to the US dropped nearly 18% in the first 10 months of this year versus that period in 2024, they were up more than 7% to the European Union, 14% to countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and 26% to Africa, according to Chinese customs data released last week. Overall, exports rose 5.3%.\nIn Southeast Asia, that trade was buoyed by leaps in the export of machine tools, automobile parts and computer components. In Africa, construction machinery and green technologies have been key exports, analysts say, while parts of Latin America have seen significant growth in electric vehicles, chemical fertilizers and electronics, among other areas.\nThis trade engine was humming before the start of the trade war.\nAlready the world\u2019s manufacturing superpower, China\u2019s rapid climb to dominate green technologies like EVs, lithium-ion batteries, and solar panels, had driven up demand from countries looking to convert to renewable energy cheaply \u2013 and concern from those accusing China of unfair competition with subsidized products.\nSome of those goods \u2013 like EVs and solar panels \u2013 were already effectively barred from the US market by high tariffs put in place in recent years, and China\u2019s exporters have been building out trade across developing markets.\n\u201c(China) has prepared quite well for this,\u201d said Jacob Gunter, who heads the economy and industry program at the MERICS think tank in Berlin.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t some miracle of foresight thinking to predict that the United States would escalate over time its trade and technology conflict with China, but China was (expanding markets) before the trade and tech war began, and ever since it\u2019s started, that trend has really accelerated,\u201d he said.\nEven as many companies had to scramble to divert business from the US market in recent months, experts say the groundwork for the pivot was laid by Beijing\u2019s decades-long push to build out its global economic footprint \u2013 expanding trade while also bankrolling ports, terminals and highways under Xi\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.\nIt\u2019s also relied on an earlier push from Chinese firms to move supply chains and production centers out of China to areas from Southeast Asia to Mexico \u2013 where goods are shipped from China to be fabricated or finished.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the key for the so-called resilience of Chinese exports,\u201d said Yao Yang, dean of the Di-shui-hu Advanced Finance Institute at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, who noted these investments began during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\u201cWithout those outbound investments, I don\u2019t think that China can cope with the shock.\u201d\nBut Beijing\u2019s trade resilience has also raised fears that a deluge of Chinese goods into other markets will wipe out domestic industries.\nCountries have been hitting back with probes on Chinese goods, with the US and India, as well as Mexico and Brazil, together raising 79 anti-dumping and countervailing probes against Chinese goods in the first half of this year \u2013 a significant uptick from recent years before 2024, according to World Trade Organization data.\nThere\u2019s also calls for exports or factory relocations to come alongside greater levels of local investment, knowledge transfer and more balanced trade.\nFor some Latin American countries, \u201cdeindustrialization is a big problem when Chinese companies start to invest \u2026 because they bring just the assembly, they don\u2019t do technology and knowledge transfer,\u201d said Diego Rodriguez, logistics and industrial practice leader at Americas Market Intelligence, a research firm in Miami, noting countries like Brazil are pushing back against this.\nIn Southeast Asia, the stronger flow of goods is a concern, according to Rebecca Sta Maria, former executive director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation secretariat.\n\u201cWe feel as if we are being swamped. I remember one economy saying a \u2018tsunami of Chinese goods coming into ASEAN.\u2019 Of course that\u2019s a concern to us,\u201d said Sta Maria, now the director of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. But it wasn\u2019t all negative, she added, because small and medium-sized businesses were using high-end components from China, making their products more competitive.\n\u201cI know that the Chinese government has acknowledged (the concern) to some extent, so now it\u2019s how do we manage this?\u201d\nBeijing denies accusations that its goods are flooding markets. Its officials have instead taken Trump\u2019s global trade shake-up as an opportunity to tout China as the reliable trade partner, while pledging to open its vast market wider to exporters and investors from around the world.\nObservers say some countries may also be unwilling to throw up barriers to China at a time when they are facing higher tariffs on their own goods into the US \u2013 that\u2019s especially when there is true demand in many countries.\nIn Africa, \u201cit\u2019s a two-way street,\u201d said Capital Economics emerging market analyst David Omojomolo.\n\u201cThese countries (in Africa) want to industrialize\u2026 there\u2019s a massive electricity gap across the continent \u2013 solar panels are cheap and China\u2019s got overcapacity \u2026 they need to send them somewhere, so of course, Africa is going to benefit.\u201d\nEven still, manufacturers across China have struggled to fill the hole left by the drop in US exports.\nFactory employees in recent months have described to CNN canceled shifts, mandatory furloughs and lost jobs as employers deciding to relocate out of China.\nGarment maker Zhang Peipei in Jiangxi province told CNN she has been able to keep her 20-year-old business afloat through smaller revenue streams coming from outside the US. But she says the unpredictable US tariff policies have already caused \u201cserious and irreversible long-term impact\u201d without clear alternatives.\nWith her business now hanging on whether she can cut a deal with buyers in Mexico, Zhang said she didn\u2019t feel \u201cvery confident,\u201d even despite a potential return of some US business now, \u201csince the US has been shaking up the foreign trade scene, the whole world is chaotic right now.\u201d\nAnd there are questions about whether China\u2019s robust trade data this year showed true demand or a short-term push to get goods out of the country to stockpile them or ship them to the US via a third country with lower tariffs.\nAn analysis of US and Chinese trade data from April to July \u2013 including the height of the trade uncertainty \u2013 suggests that just less than a quarter of China\u2019s trade diverted from the US was likely still ultimately ending up in the US, while the rest of the goods were finding alternative markets, according to Gerard DiPippo, a senior researcher at the RAND China Research Center.\n\u201cStill, l\u2019m not all that confident that the final demand for all those (other) exports going to the Global South is actually going to be remaining in those countries,\u201d he said, noting that exporters could also be building up offshore inventories as they waited to see how countries\u2019 trade talks with the US played out.\n\u201cThe big caveat,\u201d he added, is that \u201cthe margins of Chinese exporters are almost certainly getting squeezed \u2026 they\u2019re maintaining high volumes in real terms, but they\u2019re doing it by cutting prices.\u201d\nThe recent truce between Xi and Trump leaves tariffs on Chinese goods at around 47% on average, but could see the return of more US business.\nBut as uncertainty remains across the global economy, a driving focus for those in China, both in the factories and the government, will be on expanding how much the country\u2019s own consumers buy domestic-made goods.\nThat\u2019s the case for Wang, the cookware maker in Guangdong. Despite finding new clients outside the US, he is also making another pivot, directing more of his business to China\u2019s domestic market, and less of it outside, he said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/14\/china\/china-us-trade-war-global-exports-intl-hnk-dst","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Carmakers worried Trump\u2019s tariffs would shred their bottom lines. Here\u2019s how they avoided the worst of it","date":"2025-11-03","body":"When President Donald Trump introduced his tariff policyearlier this year, it looked like a disaster for automakers. But even with US tariffs on imported cars and parts, it has shaped up to be a pretty good time for car companies.\nMost automakers, even US-based ones, import some cars and most parts. But car companies\u2019 dire cost estimates have decreased as tariffs keep getting rolled back, bit by bit.\nMoreimportantly for automakers\u2019 bottom lines, the financial penalties for not meeting fuel efficiency rules have all but vanished. Those regulatory savings could eventually offset the cost of tariffs.\nAll in all, one could argue that auto industry profits could end up better off than they were before Trump took office in January, a surprising outcome as automakers\u2019 huge investments in electric vehicles in recent years were also being undercut by Trump pulling the plug on the federal support of electric vehicles they had counted on when making that massive bet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely favorable,\u201d said Jeff Schuster, an independent auto analyst about the changes since auto tariffs were first announced in March. \u201cThere are so many moving pieces, it\u2019s hard to isolate. But things are definitely better off than anyone expected.\u201d\nAutomakers were close to panic when Trump announced plans for a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, including those from Mexico and Canada, since all companies depend on imported parts to build at US assembly plants and almost all import from those neighboring countries. Ford CEO Jim Farley said the tariffs \u201cwould blow a hole in the US industry that we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d\nBut it turned out it wasn\u2019t as bad as they feared, as Trump continued to reduce the worst of the duties\u2019 impact almost immediately. General Motors and Ford, which had forecast billions in annual costs, have each reduced those assessments. GM trimmed its $5 billion estimate by $500 million last month. Ford cut its estimated tariff cost for 2025 in half, from $2 billion to $1 billion.\nVolkswagen reported a 1 billion euro loss ($1.3 billion) in the third quarter and said that the tariffs would cost it up to $5.8 billion this year. But some of the loss was due to other problems with its European EVs and a reorganization at Porsche.\nWhile tariff costs have also trimmed automakers\u2019 profits, companies managed to beat expectations. For example, GM\u2019s adjusted earnings per share had been forecast to fall 23% in the third quarter. Instead, it fell just 5%. Even the Volkswagen loss was less than a quarter of forecasts.\nEven automakers from Asia and Europe have been able to weather the storm, since they build a significant share of their US-sold vehicles in America.\nHyundai CEO Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz told reporters in New York in September that even with the US tariffs, the United States, not South Korea, is Hyundai\u2019s most profitable market. He expects that to continue.\n\u201cTariffs are still a headwind,\u201d said Dan Ives, analyst with Wedbush Securities. \u201cBut so far they\u2019ve been digested well.\u201d\nAnd further tariff reductions are likely if the administration reaches a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico \u2014two of the largest sources of imported cars and auto parts.\nTrump recently halted Canadian trade negotiations after an ad funded by the province of Ontario featured a 1987 anti-tariff speech by former President Ronald Reagan. But experts think there will be some kind of trade deal in the future.\nA free trade deal with South Korea, another source of imported vehicles, would also help reduce tariff costs for not just Hyundai and Kia but also General Motors, which builds some of the cheaper cars at its US dealerships in South Korea.\nThe blunted tariff impact has also benefitted car buyers.\nCompanies have not passed on the increased tariff costs to consumers, at least not directly. However, there have been some quiet moves by automakers to recoup some of the costs of the duties, such as charging for equipment that had once been included in the price, or ending production on less profitable models.\nAs a results, the average price of a new car purchase stands at just around $50,000, according to estimates from Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book, up about 4% from a year ago.\nWhile tariffs capture most of the headlines about government action, there\u2019s been a less publicized windfall for automakers: the end of financial penalties for violating emissions standards.\nIn the past, automakers avoided fines for selling too many gasoline vehicles by purchasing so-called regulatory credits from companies that fell below emission standards, like electric vehicle maker Tesla.\nBut those penalties were eliminated in July\u2019s tax and spending bill, saving the automakers billions. Ford CFO Sherry House told reporters last month it will no longer purchase the $2.5 billion worth of regulatory credits it had planned to buy in the future.\nIves said that no longer having to buy credits should reduce the cost of building a vehicle by 3% to 5%. Automakers can also ramp up sales of the more profitable large trucks and SUVs that were previously capped by emissions levels.\nIn fact, Ford announced it was increasing production of its F-150 and F-Series Super Duty in 2026 by more than 50,000 trucks to meet demand.GM also revealed plans to shift production of one of its Michigan plants from EVs, which have been losing money, to profitable gasoline powered vehicles.\n\u201cAs the regulatory costs go away, that does paint a much better picture for the health of the industry than anyone thought would be passed,\u201d said Schuster. \u201cThe near-term outlook is much more favorable than in April.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/03\/business\/automakers-outlook-tariff-regulation-impact","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

Here are examples from around the world.\nThe Swiss economy shrank in the third quarter at the sharpest rate since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The governmentattributedthe contraction largely to a plunge in output from the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, noting recent volatility in foreign trade linked tonew US tariffs.\nOver in Asia, Japan\u2019s economy alsocontractedin the third quarter.

That tariff made it \u201cpractically impossible to export to that market,\u201d M\u00e1rcio Ferreira, president of exporter group Cecaf\u00e9 or the Brazilian Coffee Exporters Council,saidin October.\nUS coffee imports from the world\u2019s top producer more than halved in the August-November period compared with a year prior, based on the council\u2019s latestdata. The drop contributedto a 32.2% fall in Brazilian coffee sales to the United States since the start of 2025, year-over-year.\nDespite the decline, the United States was the biggest importer of Brazilian coffee in the first 11 months of 2025. Coffee production and related activities account for up to 1.8% of Brazil\u2019s GDP, while coffee farming employs about 3% of the country\u2019s workforce, including seasonal and indirect jobs, Brazil\u2019s agriculture ministry told CNN.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/11\/business\/global-impact-us-tariffs-trump-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Now, it\u2019s up to lawmakers on both sides to take actions to improve the nation\u2019s fiscal situation, or another downgrade could be in the cards. And that one would likely be even more painful.\nYet, days later, House Republicans on the Budget Committeevoted to advance a sweeping legislative agendathat could worsen the fiscal picture, adding over $1 trillion to annual deficits by 2034 compared to 2024, according to preliminary estimates from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nHowever, it\u2019s far from a done deal, as it faces a slew of hurdles in both chambers of Congress despite Republicans having a majority. Even Trump administration officials have suggested the agenda, dubbed the \u201cone, big, beautiful bill,\u201d could be modified to get it to the finish line.\nRelated articleHere\u2019s what\u2019s in the House GOP\u2019s sweeping tax and spending cuts package\nBut some Trump administration officials insist the agenda, which calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that exceed a wide array of spending cuts, won\u2019t add to the nation\u2019s budget deficit, the gap between what the government collects in revenue versus how much it spends. That difference is financed by borrowing money from people who invest in US bonds and Treasuries, which pay a varying amount of interest, also known as the yield.\nFor instance, White House Council of Economic Advisers Chair Stephen Miran said in a CNBC interview on Monday that efforts included in the bill to \u201ccut waste, fraud and abuse are going to end up bringing the deficit down by almost half a point of GDP, or maybe even a little bit more than that.\u201d\nEarlier in the day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, \u201cThis bill does not add to the deficit.\u201d\nHad Moody\u2019s not downgraded US debt two days prior, Republican lawmakers in particular may have been more willing to take such comments at face value. But now, with the fiscal situation back in the spotlight, more diligence could be warranted.\n\u201cMoody\u2019s downgrade reflects concerns stemming from years of bad fiscal decisions in Washington,\u201d Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter Peterson Foundation, which advocates for America\u2019s fiscal stability, told CNN. The country already is on track to add $22 trillion more to the $36 trillion debt level over the next decade, he said. President Donald Trump\u2019s bill \u201cwould only accelerate the pace of borrowing by adding trillions to this already unsustainable path.\u201d\nOn Monday, investors took note of the risks Moody\u2019s outlined in explaining its decision to downgrade US debt to one notch below perfect. Key to that was \u201cthe increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in its Friday statement.\nYields on 30-year US bonds soared by over a percentage point,touching 5% at one point on Monday, while yields on shorter-term debt held by the US government also rose. Both point to the same message: The risks of investing in American debt, long considered the safest asset, have grown.\nRelated articleJamie Dimon continues to warn of recession, despite pullback in China tariffs\nConsumers, just like the government, tend to have to pay more to borrow money when yields rise since banks and other lenders often base interest rates on US Treasury and bond yields.\n\u201cWith our divisive politics preventing progress, it\u2019s no surprise that financial markets are watching \u2014 and increasingly worried,\u201d Peterson added.\nCallie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, similarly alluded to rising yields on US debt as a wake-up call for lawmakers. \u201cThe government deficit isn\u2019t a problem until investors think it is. And they\u2019re increasingly telling us that the deficit is a problem,\u201d Cox said in a note on Monday.\nRyan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the downgrade increases the odds that Trump\u2019s package, if passed, will carry fewer tax cuts than what\u2019s currently being proposed to minimize the deficit impact.\n\u201cThe downgrade will catch the attention of the fiscal hawks and make it unlikely that some of the proposed features, including no taxes on overtime and an enhanced standard deduction for seniors aged 65 and older that are not in our baseline, will be included in the fiscal package,\u201d he said in a note on Monday.\nSweet also said the downgrade will likely extend the length of time it takes to pass the bill, if at all. Meanwhile, top Trump administration officials, including National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, say they\u2019re optimistic it\u2019ll pass by the middle of this summer.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/20\/economy\/us-debt-crisis","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Is China winning the trade war against the US? Here\u2019s what the data says","date":"2025-11-01","body":"The yearslong trade war between China and the United States was amplified in February 2025 when President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on the Asian nation, Canada and Mexico on February 1. Since then, the two countries have been entangled in achaotic relationship, with tit-for-tat tariffs at times reaching triple-digit levels.\nBut after Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in South Korea last Thursday to discuss trade and other issues, Trump agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese goods by 10% in exchange for promises that Beijing will crack down on the flow of fentanyl into the US. The effective tariff rate will still stand at around 47% for Chinese goods entering the US.\nBut how is China doing since Trump started his second term as president and tariffs have been levied worldwide? Here\u2019s what the data says.\nEven before Trump\u2019s second term, China\u2019s exports to the US had been declining. That\u2019s accelerated even more over the past few months.\nIn September, exports to the US totaled $34.3 billion, compared with $47 billion in the same month last year \u2013 down 27%.\nBut despite this steep decline in trade with the US, Chinese exports are up 6.1% this year, with September data showing an 8.3% increase compared with a year earlier, as exports to other areas surged.\nChina is not only diversifying its exports but is also importing more products from other countries as it looks to alternatives to American goods.\nSoybeans, a key commodity for both China and the US, were a big part of trade negotiations.\nAlthough Chinese imports of American soybeans have been declining consistently in the past few months, for the first time in years, China didn\u2019t import any soybeans from the US in September. Instead,China has turned to Braziland Argentina, where soybean shipments to China continue to grow. In September, the Argentinian government temporarily suspended its soybean export tax, prompting the Chinese government to buy about 1.2 million metric tons from the South American country.\nChicago soybean futures, which track global soybean prices, rose earlier thisweek ahead of talks between Xi and Trump. After the meeting between the two leaders, China agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans this season and committed to buying 25 million metric tons annually for the next three years, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last Thursday.\nMeanwhile, China, the third-biggest buyer of American beef, has been purchasing much less of the commodity in recent months. From January to July of this year, the country purchased $481 million worth of American beef, accounting for 8% of US beef exports, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture.

{"title":"If you think Trump\u2019s China deal is the end of the story, you haven\u2019t been paying attention","date":"2025-10-27","body":"Financial markets kicked off the week by gleefully cheering the weekend\u2019s headlines that trade talks between the United States and China went smoothly. Just weeks earlier, Trump hadthreatenedto impose a 100% tariff on Chinese exports and said he might call off a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Now, that meeting looks set to take place this week.\nIf all that seems like a rerun of a movie we\u2019ve seen before but no one quite remembers how it ends, that\u2019s because it never really did.\nThe latest escalation between Trump and Xi arose afterBeijing announcedplans to restrict exports of rare-earth minerals, critical materials needed to power a wide range of electronics.\nBut that\u2019s hardly anything new \u2014 China, which controls the majority of the world\u2019s supply of rare earth minerals, began putting measures in place to limit foreign access to them over 30 years ago. And as demand for China\u2019s rare earths has increased since, so have the safeguards for allowing other countries to purchase them.\nAfter meeting with Chinese trade negotiators in Malaysia over the weekend, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he anticipates the high-stakes meeting between Trump and Xi could result in \u201csome kind of deferral\u201d on rare-earth export controls.\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who has led Chinese trade talks with Bessent, said the Treasury secretary told Chinese negotiators at their last meeting, \u201cThis is the last time we want to be talking about rare earths.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, that is not the last timetheywant to be talking about it,\u201d Greer told reporters earlier this month.\nHe\u2019s right. \u201cSome kind of deferral\u201d simply means Xi is still going to be able to use access to rare earths as leverage over the United States any time he is perturbed with actions Trump takes.\nAnd when Beijing inevitably announces new ramped-up export controls of rare earths, Trump will likely respond by threatening higher tariffs.\nBut there\u2019s no guarantee Trump or Xi will build off their envoys\u2019 groundwork. Trump has a recent history of stirring the pot, undermining the diplomatic victories Bessent and Greer secured with China. For instance, just weeks after they inked a deal resulting in significantly lower tariffs on both countries, Trump slappedexport controlson chip design software to China. (Those werelater lifted.)\nThe more optimistic take, though, is there could be some breakthrough deal on rare earths or otherwise that comes out of a meeting between Trump and Xi this week. But it\u2019s still hard to take any progress between Trump and Xi too seriously, considering both sides have alleged the other violated prior deals.\nJust last week, Greer opened an investigation into whether China is adhering to the terms of a trade agreement Trump brokered during his first term. As part of that agreement, China committed to increasing purchases of American products by $200 billion by the end of 2021. However, it fell far short of that level.\nAs Trump sought to lower the temperature with China, a longtime rival, he raised it with one of America\u2019s biggest allies and neighbors, Canada.\nIn response to an ad Ontario commissioned that featured parts of an anti-tariff speech by former President Ronald Reagan in 1987, Trumpthreatenedto increase tariffs on Canada, America\u2019s second-largest trading partner, by an additional 10%.\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been hesitant to retaliate against tariffs Trump has enacted on his country, but that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t. After Trump suspended trade talks over the tariff ad, Carney told reporters Monday: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pay to be upset. Emotions don\u2019t carry you very far.\u201d\nEither way, if Trump continues to alienate his allies, he risks making America\u2019s economy even more dependent on China.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/27\/economy\/rare-earth-minerals-china-us-trade-deal","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Against the odds, Americans are still spending","date":"2025-09-16","body":"Americans still opened their wallets last month, despite persistent fears about the economy, a slowing labor market and higher tariffs.\nSpending at US retailers rose 0.6% in August, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, unchanged from July\u2019s upwardly revised 0.6%. Last month\u2019s figure came in much better than economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.2% increase, according to a poll by data firm FactSet. Retail sales are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation.\nEmployers havehit the brakes on hiringin recent months as Americansonce again grow pessimisticabout the economy\u2019s future. President Donald Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs have also began to push up some prices, according to the Consumer Price Index.\nYet, US consumers haven\u2019t cut back their spending meaningfully, and they may continue to spend, so long as layoffs don\u2019t surge.\nRetail spending was up across most categories last month, with online sales and purchases at clothing stores rising the most, increasing 2% and 1%, respectively.\nThe so-called control group of retail sales \u2014 a measure that strips out volatile components \u2014 rose 0.74% in August, up from July\u2019s 0.5% and well above economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.4% increase.\nSales last month were down at specialty stores and furniture retailers, falling 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively. Spending at health shops and department stores were both down 0.1% each.\n\u201cThe economy seems to be doing just fine for now and perhaps the slow-down in payroll jobs is one gigantic head fake when it comes to forecasting the economy,\u201d wrote Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at Fwd Bonds, in an analyst note Tuesday. \u201cConsumer spending is resilient. Interest rate cuts do not need to be adjusted as the economy is sailing along just fine.\u201d\nSpending at restaurants and bars rose 0.7% in August from the prior month, according to the report.\nConsumer spending remains resilient as other parts of the economy sputter.\nJob growth during the summerwas tepid, with revised data showing employers shed jobs in June, the first negative employment tally since December 2020. That brought an end to what was the second-longest period of employment expansion on record. Unemployment has also crept up and the number of unemployed people seeking work now outpaces job openings, according to Labor Department data.\nMeanwhile, consumer sentiment is sliding back, after it briefly recovered from the near record lows of the spring when Trump launched his unpredictable global trade war.\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s Index of Consumer Sentiment unexpectedly fell early this month to a reading of 55.4, with consumers continuing \u201cto note multiple vulnerabilities in the economy,\u201d according to a release. Joanne Hsu, the survey\u2019s director, said in commentary that \u201ctrade policy remains highly salient to consumers, with about 60% of consumers providing unprompted comments about tariffs during interviews.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s tariffs are bigger than his tax cuts for most Americans\nAmericans are also planning to cut back on spending in the future. Consumers expect that their monthly spending growth will likely be in the 3% range for the next year, according to the latest consumer survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, released Monday, a step back from expectations for 3.3% monthly growth.\nFederal Reserve officials on Tuesday begin their two-day policy meeting, which is widely expected to result in the first interest rate cut since December. A weakening labor market is a key reason why the Fed is expected to lower rates.\nFor now, America\u2019s economic engine is still revving, largely thanks to the group that\u2019s typically responsible for keeping spending afloat.\n\u201cThe retail sales figures suggest aggregate spending is now back on track following a weak [first half of the year], but we think much of that strength has been concentrated among higher income households, who are responsible for most spending,\u201d Michael Pearce, deputy chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said in written commentary Tuesday. \u201cSpending among low-income consumers is still under pressure from a weakening labor market and a policy mix that is weighing on real disposable incomes.\u201d\n\u201cWe expect that dynamic to persist in 2026, even as overall spending holds up,\u201d he added.\nCNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/16\/economy\/us-retail-sales-august","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Tariff-exposed industries are losing jobs","date":"2025-09-09","body":"President Donald Trump has promised his high tariffs will inspire an American manufacturing renaissance.\nYet so far his controversial experiment has failed to inspire a jobs boom. Not only is hiringweak, but the industriesmost exposed to tariffs have been shedding workers\u2013 exactly the opposite of the intended outcome.\nJob growth in tariff-impacted sectors including manufacturing, construction and transportation turned negative shortly after Trump started his trade war this spring, according to anew analysisby Apollo Global chief economist Torsten Slok.\nSlok\u2019s research, based on a three-month moving average of Bureau of Labor Statistics data on employment, shows that while tariff-impacted sectors had moments of job loss in recent years, this is the first time payroll growth is negative over a period of several months.\nEmployment in industries not affected by tariffs continues to increase, albeit at a slower pace than before the trade war.\n\u201cThe tariff impact on hiring is now undeniable. The manufacturing renaissance, the hiring boom, is just not happening,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, told CNN.\nManufacturing employment hasdeclined four months in a row, according tothe August jobs reportreleased last Friday. The US manufacturing industry has78,000 fewer jobsthan it did a year ago, BLS data shows.\nOf course, tariffs were never going to dramatically increase manufacturing jobs overnight. It\u2019s too early to say how the strategy will play out in the long run.\nStill, some economists say the administration\u2019s chaotic trade strategy is backfiring in at least two ways.\nFirst, it has caused enormous uncertainty that has\u201cparalyzed\u201d manufacturersand other companies in tariff-exposed industries, causing them to pull back on hiring.\nSecondly, tariff hikes on steel, aluminum, copper and other key inputs have raised prices for the same US manufacturers that are supposed to be benefiting from the trade agenda.\n\u201cIt turns out the community of economists were correct that launching a trade war would result in slower growth and few jobs. That\u2019s what is happening,\u201d Brusuelas said.\n\u201cThe Trump administration has embarked on the most aggressive pro-growth economic agenda in modern history, and our policies of tax cuts and rapid deregulation have already yielded trillions in historic investment commitments to make and hire in America,\u201d  White House Spokesman Kush Desai said.\nThe job loss in tariff-exposed industries has contributed to abroader slowdown in hiring across the US economy.\nThe pace of US job growth has slowed to just 29,000 over the past three months, down sharply from 105,000 during the prior three-month period, according to JPMorgan research. The unemployment rate remains low, but it has edged up from 4.1% in June to 4.3% in August \u2013 the highest since late 2021.\nAmericans are increasingly pessimistic about their prospects of getting a new job.\nConsumers believe there\u2019s just a 45% chance of finding a new job if they currently don\u2019t have one, down from 51% in July, according tosurvey datareleased Monday by the New York Federal Reserve.\nIt\u2019s the lowest reading since the survey launched in 2013 and much lower than readings during much of Trump\u2019s first term in office. The NY Fed said the drop in expectations of finding a new job was \u201cbroad-based across age, education and income groups, but it was most pronounced for those with at most a high school education.\u201d\nTrump officials have dismissed the recent string of concerning economic reports, including Friday\u2019s jobs report, and questioned their accuracy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do economic policy off of one number,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessenttold NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201din an interview that aired last weekend. \u201cWe believe that good policies are in place that are going to create good high-paying jobs for the American people.\u201d\nBessent argued that Trump\u2019s sweeping spending and tax cut law will eventually translate to an increase in construction and manufacturing jobs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a couple of months. And with the manufacturing sector, as you know, we can\u2019t snap our fingers and have factories built,\u201d Bessent said.\nBeyond the trade war, some economists say the loss of jobs in tariff-exposed industries is linked to another Trump policy: the immigration crackdown.\nStephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said strength in native-born employment is \u201cmasking weakness\u201d among foreign-born workers.\nAlthough the monthly data on foreign-born employment can be volatile, the trends suggest the job market is suffering from a lower supply of workers.\nForeign-born employment dropped by 342,000 in August on a seasonally adjusted basis, building on a decline of 416,000 in July, according to Wolfe Research. So far this year, foreign-born employment is down by 1.5 million.\nSome of the same sectors vulnerable to tariff and trade war uncertainty, such as construction, are also exposed to tougher immigration enforcement.\n\u201cThe latest data is painting a picture of a slowing labor market, due to a combination of both supply and demand,\u201d Roth said.\nShe is hopeful that some of the pressure on the job market will ease as businesses get greater clarity on where tariffs will settle, allowing for a rebound in hiring later this year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about the economic uncertainty than the tariffs themselves,\u201d Roth said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/09\/business\/jobs-trade-trump-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"How Trump\u2019s tariffs forced China to pivot \u2013 and export more","date":"2025-12-10","body":"Just a year ago, Chinese manufacturers, fearing a new trade war, rushed to push out exports following the election victory of US President Donald Trump, who had pledged to slap punishing tariffs on imports from China over America\u2019s widening trade deficit.\nA year later, Trump has delivered on his promise. But China has pivoted \u2013 and exported more.\nIn a striking display of resilience, the world\u2019s second-largest economy notched arecord trade surplus of $1 trillionin just the first 11 months of the year \u2013 a milestone no other nation has achieved.\nThe stunning outcome \u2013 underscoring that the American market is not entirely irreplaceable \u2013 has bolstered Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s confidence in taking a hardball approach with Trump throughout this year\u2019s protracted trade war. While the two countries have dialed back tensions and returned to a fragile trade truce after Trump and Xi\u2019s meeting in October, a final agreement remains nowhere in sight.\nThe key to China\u2019s export success under Trump\u2019s tariff pressure is straightforward \u2014 and not entirely driven from the top. Chinese exporters have doubled down on a strategy they began deploying during Trump\u2019s first term: diversifying away from the United States, rerouting shipments, and leaning aggressively into markets hungry for cheaper goods.\nIn the first 11 months of the year, China\u2019s exports surged 5.7% from a year earlier, according tocustoms data. Growth in exports to Europe, Southeast Asia and Africa \u2013 up 8.9%, 14.6% and 27.2% respectively \u2013 more than offset an 18.3% plunge in shipments to the US in the same period,customs datashowed.\nStill, China\u2019s soaring trade surplus cannot obscure its underlying economic troubles. Its glaring export performance partly reflects deeper structural challenges \u2014 including lethargic domestic demand and weak consumer confidence.\nChina\u2019s manufacturing prowess has cemented its position as the world\u2019s factory, laying the foundation for its agile export pivot. But years of heavy investment in the manufacturing sector have alsoproduced significant overcapacity in several sectors, pushing industries to chase overseas markets for growth while exacerbating price competition at home.\nExports have long been a critical pillar of China\u2019s economic growth.\nUnder Xi\u2019s Made in China 2025 industrial strategy unveiled a decade ago, Beijing has pumped billions into strategic sectors with the aim of dominating high-tech supply chains on top of traditional industries.\nThe results of that ambition \u2013 advances in China\u2019s already formidable manufacturing capabilities, coupled with a pandemic-driven demand boom \u2013 pushed up China\u2019s exports by nearly 45% over the past five years, according to Nomura, a financial services firm.\nOther manufacturing economies have struggled to keep pace with China\u2019s high-volume, low-price output, and in recent years, some developing countries\u2019 reliance on Chinese products and components has only deepened.\nIn acommentarypublished Monday by state-run media, Wang Jun, deputy head of the General Administration of Customs, credited China\u2019s trade success to the country\u2019s comprehensive industrial supply chain, momentum generated by higher-tech sectors, and the determination of exporters who press ahead despite challenges.\nHu Xijin, a former editor-in-chief of the state-run tabloid Global Times and prominent nationalist commentator, put it more bluntly.\n\u201cThe competitiveness of Chinese products cannot be wiped out by trade protectionism. Their quality and low prices offer an irresistible appeal, and market forces determine that China\u2019s supply chain is unmatched in today\u2019s world,\u201d hewrote on social mediaMonday.\nBut economists have pointed out that part of China\u2019s export growth to other regions may simply reflect transshipments \u2013 goods routed through countries such as those in Southeast Asia where they undergo additional processing and assembly before being re-exported to the US.\nThe actual volume of these transshipments remains challenging for government officials and economists to quantify, complicating US tariffs enforcement, even though Trump has imposed additional levies on re-routed goods and struck deals on transshipment tariffs with countries like Vietnam.\nEconomists have also questioned whether such rapid export growth is sustainable. Many expect China\u2019s exports to remain resilient next year, though the pace of expansion is likely to moderate from this year\u2019s level.\nZichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a Monday research note that she expected the country\u2019s trade surplus to widen further next year, as trade rerouting buoys exports while imports are expected to decline amid weak domestic demand.\nBut further protectionist policies loom on the horizon. Even before this year, governments from the European Union to India and Brazil had raised concerns about Chinese \u201cdumping\u201d of goods into their markets. The expanded exports this year are likely to intensify such worries.\nThe EU has already imposed tariffs and other anti-dumping measures on Chinese electric vehicles and other exports.\nDuring a visit to China last week, French President Emmanuel Macron highlighted the \u201cunbearable\u201d trade imbalances between European countries and China, warning in an interview with aFrench newspaperlater that further tariffs could be imposed.\nBehind the impressive growth in exports, economic challenges linger within China.\nThe property sector, once another major growth pillar, remains in slowdown, now entering its fifth year. For many Chinese who have plowed their savings into real estate, the market\u2019s collapse handicapped their ability to spend, driving down overall demand.\nStill-high youth unemployment as well as weak social security systems further weigh on consumption. That is why for the first 11 months of the year, imports, a gauge of domestic demand, have risen only 0.2% compared with a year ago.\nAdding to the mix of problems, deflation has clouded the economy for much of the year, driven by overcapacity and cutthroat price wars, particularly in sectors such aselectric vehicles, e-commerce and construction materials. The race to the bottom has been so ferocious this year that Beijing stepped in to rein in manufacturers, though economists believe deflationary pressures are unlikely to ease soon.\nAmid these challenges, exports have become an economic lifeline, one of the few reliable sources of growth at a time when Beijing remains reluctant to unleash a major stimulus program.\nThe Chinese government\u2019s Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), a key annual two-day meeting setting the economic agenda for the year ahead, concluded Thursday.\nAn official readout noted that the national economy still faces a mix of \u201cold problems and new challenges.\u201d\n\u201cThe impact of changing external environment is intensifying, and there\u2019s a noticeable contradiction between strong supply and weak demand domestically, along with significant risks in key areas,\u201d it said.\nChina used its trade juggernaut to withstand US tariffs. Can it keep its edge?\nA \u201cmore proactive fiscal policy\u201d and a \u201cmoderately loose monetary policy\u201d will continue to be in place for next year, it added.\nBeijing is also set to unveil itsnext five-year economic blueprint, which will guide China\u2019s development strategy and priorities for the next half-decade. Full details of the plan will not be released until March.\nAt a Communist Party conclave in October, officialshintedthat the next half-decade priorities will focus on increasing China\u2019s \u201ceconomic strength, scientific and technological capabilities, national defense strength\u201d in a bid to accelerate development in \u201cmanufacturing, product quality, aerospace, transportation, and cyberspace.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Joyce Jiang contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/10\/business\/china-trade-surplus-us-tariffs-analysis-intl-hnk","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"American consumers are getting nervous about inflation again. For now, they\u2019re still spending","date":"2025-08-15","body":"Americans are still opening their wallets, with unemployment remaining low and businesses blunting the effects of President Donald Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs.\nButconsumers remain skittish over Trump\u2019s erratic trade war, according to recent surveys. Still, they haven\u2019t cut back and consumer prices have remained somewhat tame.\nBusinesses have played a key rolein keeping the economy afloat, despite persistent economic jitters. For instance, companies mostly have not ramped up layoffs to deal with the cost pressures arising from Trump\u2019s tariffs. Unemploymentremains low at 4.2%, and if Americans have a job, then they\u2019re able to spend and save.\nCompanies have also managed Trump\u2019s confusing onslaught of tariffs through a serious of maneuvers that have, so far, kept inflation from surging; a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond detailed all those strategies.\nAfter briefly improving from the near-record lows in the spring, consumer sentiment went into reverse again this month, the University of Michigan said Friday. But that might not mean anything for spending, since sentiment has been a lousy predictor of purchasing behavior in recent years.\nPut together, this has allowed consumers to continue to power the US economy with their spending, which contributes about 70% of economic output (though there are signs of caution on how long this resilience can last.)\n\u201cAs long as consumer spending holds up and companies are able to retain workers because of that robust spending, the flywheel can continue to spin, pushing corporate profits and stock prices higher,\u201d Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, said in commentary issued Friday.\nSince the beginning of the year, Trump has rewritten US trade policy, with a new wave of tariffs thatwent into earlier this month.Businesses have scrambled to deal with the fallout.\nEconomists have long said that tariffs will likely stoke consumer inflation, but so far, that hasn\u2019t happened. That might be because of how businesses have handled the situation, according to a recent analysis from the Richmond Fed that looked at survey responses from businesses.\nThe report said that businesses have delayed ordering inventories, delayed the timing of when a tariff is charged and negotiated partnerships with suppliers and customers to share costs. Many businesses also stocked up on inventories in the beginning of the year to avoid tariff-induced sticker shock.\nAnd fortunately for the American worker, one of those strategies hasn\u2019t been to trim headcount. New applications for unemployment benefits remain low, according to Labor Department data.\nThat\u2019s done the trick in keeping a lid on consumer inflation, but it might not last for much longer. The latest Producer Price Index, which measures the prices businesses pay their suppliers, surged 0.9% in July from the prior month, lifting the annual rate to 3.3%. The monthly and annual figures both rose much more than economists had expected.\n\u201cSensing from businesses suggests that the impact of tariffs on theirprice-settinghas been lagged, but it is starting to play out,\u201d Richmond Fed economists said in their paper. \u201cNonetheless, it remains highly uncertain how tariffs will impact consumer inflation.\u201d\nBusinesses have been eating Trump\u2019s tariffs. That\u2019s starting to change\nConsumer sentiment remains well below where it was late last year, after the presidential election. But it hasn\u2019t \u2014 and probably still won\u2019t \u2014 predict how Americans spend in the months ahead.\nConsumer sentiment fell 5% this month to a preliminary reading of 58.6, the University of Michigan said Friday, falling for the first time in four months. Sentiment had improved, with consumers feeling a sense of relief that the worst of Trump\u2019s trade war might finally be in the rearview mirror.\nBut the effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs are still very much up in the air.\n\u201cConsumers are no longer bracing for the worst-case scenario for the economy feared in April when reciprocal tariffs were announced and then paused,\u201d Joanne Hsu, the survey\u2019s director, said in a release. \u201cHowever, consumers continue to expect both inflation and unemployment to deteriorate in the future.\u201d\nTheir expectations for inflation rates in the year ahead rose to 4.9% this month, up from 4.5% in July.\nStill, Americans will likely continue to spend, just as they did in 2022 when sentiment fell to a record low because inflation was running at 40-year highs. Or in 2023, when a standoff in Congress over the debt ceiling prompted sentiment to fall, yet spending remain robust all throughout that year.\nSpending at US retailers rose 0.5% in July, the Commerce Department said Friday. That\u2019s down from June\u2019s upwardly revised 0.9% gain, and in line with economists\u2019 expectations.\nRetail sales picked up across categories last month, especially at car dealerships and furniture stores, which saw sales climb 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Online sales jumped 0.8% in July, coinciding with Amazon\u2019s Prime Day sale. Spending also picked up at gas stations and department stores.\nRetail sales are adjusted for seasonal swings, but not inflation.\nRestaurants are under threat as costs skyrocket and consumers cut back\nMeanwhile, spending was down among only a handful of categories, including home improvement stores (-1%) and electronics retailers (-0.6%). Restaurants and bars also saw sales decline in July, falling 0.4% andextending an unusually weak period of sales growth.\nA subset of retail sales that excludes volatile categories \u2014 known as the \u201ccontrol group\u201d \u2014 rose 0.5% in July, slightly better than the 0.4% gain economists projected in a FactSet poll. That measure is seen as a better gauge of underlying consumer demand.\nEven after factoring in July\u2019s 0.2% monthly increase in consumer prices, according to the Consumer Price Index, retail sales were still up a healthy 0.3% last month.\n\u201cWhat consumers do is more important to the economy than what they say,\u201d Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said in an analyst note Friday.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/08\/15\/economy\/us-retail-sales-july","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s trade war victory is already under siege","date":"2025-07-29","body":"The economy was supposed to crumble. The trade war was expected to escalate out of control. Markets were forecast to plunge.\nNone of that happened \u2013 at least, not yet.\nPresident Donald Trump has pulled off what few outside the White House predicted:A trade war victoryof sorts that sets America\u2019s taxes on imported goods higher than the infamous Smoot-Hawley era, without any of the damaging fallout so far. Customs revenue has increased sharply while inflation remains reasonably low. And America\u2019s trading partners, for the most part, have beenwilling to acceptthe higher tariffs without significant retaliation.\nMultiple framework agreements between the United States and other trading partners have jacked up tariffs on foreign goods imported to America while setting levies on US exports at or near zero. Overseas trading partners have agreed to open previously closed markets to some US goods, pledged increased investments in the United States and dropped some of what the Trump administration has lambasted as non-trade barriers, like taxes on digital services.\nBut Trump\u2019s early trade victory may be short-lived. In fact, it is alreadyshowing signsthat it may not last.\nThe European Union, fresh off its 11th-hour compromise to get a trade agreement done before Trump\u2019s self-imposed August 1 deadline, isalready in revolt.\nFrench Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou called Sunday a \u201cdark day.\u201d Hungarian Prime Minister and Trump ally Viktor Orban said Trump steamrolled the EU. Belgium\u2019s Prime Minister Bart De Wever lambasted the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cdelusion of protectionism.\u201d And Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament\u2019s trade committee, said the deal is \u201cnot satisfactory.\u201d\nThe 27-member bloc has to hammer out key aspects of its framework, and the fragile trade truce between two of the world\u2019s largest economies could quickly break apart if sentiment turns against the arrangement.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s trade talks with its northern neighbor and one of its largest trading partners have been effectively shut down. Despite Canada relenting on its digital services tax that the president has lambasted,Trump continued to threaten higher tariffson some Canadian goods, including lumber.\nAlthough many goods imported from Canada continue to be tariff-free because of the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, the USMCA only covers just about half of Canadian goods. So higher tariffs on Canada couldraise some costs for American consumersdown the road.\nAnd the fact that America is even embroiled in a trade spat with Canada in the first place is a sign that the recent cooling off in the trade war may not last: Trump negotiated and signed the United States\u2019 current trade agreement with Canada during his first term. At any time, even after an agreement is inked, Trump could turn around and decide to raise tariffs again.\nA third round of talks between China and the United States\u2019 trade negotiators is expected to result in a continued pause of their historically high tariffs on one another. But it\u2019s unclear what else might come from the discussions, and the Trump administration has grown frustrated by what it has described as China\u2019s slow-walking of its previous agreements.\nBoth sides have aimed to reduce more regulatory barriers on shipments of key technologies. China has sought more access to critical semiconductors, and the United States wants the flow of rare earth magnets to increase further.\nBut the Trump administration has tried repeatedly to speed up China\u2019s slow progress, claiming the country has failed to live up to its agreement to approve the critical materials for crucial electronics. Trump has also said he wants China to open up its market to more US goods \u2013 a desire that Chinese Premier Xi Jinping is unlikely to give in to significantly.\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric against China has cooled in recent months, but the truce appears to be on a knife\u2019s edge.\nA crucial appeals court hearing Thursday could determine whether most of Trump\u2019s tariffs are legal at all.\nFor most of his tariffs, Trump has cited powers listed in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. But a federal court in Mayruledthat Trump overstepped his authority to levy tariffs on that basis.\nAn appeals courtpaused that rulingfrom taking effect and will hear oral arguments Thursday. It\u2019s not clear when the court will rule, and the White House would likely appeal to the Supreme Court if it loses.\nIf Trump ultimately loses his ability to levy tariffs using emergency powers, he has plenty of other options \u2013 but legal experts have said those alternatives could limit his ability to set tariffs without Congress. For example, Trump may be able to impose some tariffs as high as just 15% but only for 150 days, potentially taking some of the bite out of his tariff regime.\nAlthough the US economy remains strong, with rebounding retail sales, a still-robust labor market and rising consumer confidence, there is some evidence thatinflation in key areas is starting to creep higher\u2013 slowly \u2013 because of tariffs. That\u2019s a potential warning sign as the tariffs take full effect.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Price Index earlier this month showed that some tariff-affected goods have started to gain in price. Clothing, appliances, computers, sporting goods, toys, video equipment, hardware and tools prices have been on the rise. And it\u2019s starting to become a trend \u2013 in many of those categories, the rise has been happening for a few months.\nMany major retailers, including Walmart, have said they will raise prices because of tariffs. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide and a host of consumer goods, said Tuesday it will raise prices in part because of tariffs. And GM, Volkswagen and Stellantis all reportedtariff charges of $1 billionor more over the past quarter.\nEconomists widely expect inflation to pick up in the late summer and throughout the rest of the year as retailers work through the inventories of goods they had stockpiled before tariffs went into effect. No one expects anything close to the inflation crisis of a few years ago. But with consumers still dealing with price-hike PTSD, that won\u2019t be a welcome change from the return to healthy inflation levels over the past year.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/29\/business\/trade-war-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Retail sales jumped more than expected last month","date":"2025-07-17","body":"Americans are still opening their wallets, even as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffsstart to take a bite.\nRetail sales rose 0.6% in June from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Thursday, rebounding from the steep 0.9% decline in May.\nJune\u2019s number was much stronger than the 0.2% gain economists projected in a FactSet poll. Spending climbed across categories last month, including at car dealerships, which saw one of the biggest monthly increases. Those sales were up a robust 1.2% in June.\nHowever, the figures aren\u2019t adjusted for inflation, and some goods already began to get more expensive because of tariffs last month. After factoring inJune\u2019s 0.3% increase in consumer prices, retail sales were up a more modest 0.3%. Retail sales are adjusted for seasonal swings.\nStill, there were some signs in the latest retail spending report that Americans aren\u2019t quite yet cutting back. Sales at restaurants and bars \u2014 often seen as a barometer of discretionary spending \u2014 rose a solid 0.6% in June. Whenever consumers cut back, spending on eating out and alcoholic drinks is usually first on the chopping block.\nA measure of retail spending that strips out sales at gas stations, car dealerships and of building materials \u2014 known as the \u201ccontrol group,\u201d which provides a clearer picture of spending \u2014 was up 0.5% in June, also beating economists\u2019 expectations.\nUS stocks were slightly higher on Thursday. The Dow opened lower before jumping higher by 75 points, or 0.17%. The S&P 500 was flat and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.1%.\nInvestors and economic policymakers are keeping a close eye on whether Americans continue to spend as Trump\u2019s tariffs begin to push up prices, since consumer spending powers about two-thirds of the US economy.\n\u201cDon\u2019t count the American consumer out yet,\u201d Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in commentary issued Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of trepidation about tariffs and likely price hikes, but consumers are willing to buy if they feel they can get a good deal.\u201d\nConsumer spending was \u201csoftening slightly overall\u201d in early July, according to businesses across the country surveyed by the Federal Reserve for its latest \u201cBeige Book\u201d report.\nThe survey, released Wednesday, was conducted in the weeks leading up to July 7, and most businesses indicated that consumers are seeking bargains these days. For example, a few stores in the Richmond Fed\u2019s district said that \u201cadvertised discounts helped drive up foot traffic and sales.\u201d\n\u201cThere were robust overall sales gains at discount stores and warehouse clubs, while spending on apparel and footwear softened noticeably,\u201d the report said, referring to trends in the Chicago Fed\u2019s district.\nBut not every retailer is seeing tepid spending. A department store chain in the Northeast said that there were \u201cimproving sales, with strong sales in denim and fine jewelry.\u201d Restaurant visits in New York City, especially in Brooklyn, \u201chave continued to pick up,\u201d the report said.\nUnemployment remains relatively low, layoffs aren\u2019t picking up, and employers have continued to add jobs at a steady pace \u2014 all of which could bode well for consumer spending.\nA separate report from the Labor Department released Thursday showed that new applications for unemployment benefits in the week ending July 12, the fifth consecutive weekly decline, to 221,000. That\u2019s the lowest level since mid-April and a historically low level.\nIn June, employersadded 147,000 jobs as the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%from 4.2%, Labor Department figures show, both beating economists expectations, according to their estimates on FactSet.\nHowever, for workers without a job, today\u2019s US labor market is anything but exceptional. Ongoing worker filings for jobless benefits \u2014 those who have received payments for more than one week \u2014 edged higher in the week ending July 5, to 1.956 million. That\u2019s slightly below a 3.7-year peak reached in mid-June.\n\u201cUnemployed workers are finding it difficult to find new jobs in a labor market where hiring is slow,\u201d Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in an analyst note Thursday.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/17\/economy\/us-retail-sales-june-spending","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Trump ushers in an era of \u2018shakedown\u2019 capitalism","date":"2025-08-12","body":"President Donald Trump has realigned global trade and American politics, ushering in a new era in which pay-to-play appears to be the new norm, and every interaction is a chance to score some extra cash \u2014 even if it means starting a global trade war or demanding a payout from America\u2019s own industries.\nICYMI:American chipmakersNvidia and AMD agreed to paythe US government 15% of their revenues from semiconductor sales to China in exchange for export licenses. It\u2019s an unorthodox (andpotentially illegal) arrangement which, at minimum, offers Trump a new way to exert even more control over American business.\nThe companies will now be able to resume selling chips in China, months after Trump blocked all semiconductor sales to the country, citing national security concerns. While that might not have sunk a company as large as Nvidia \u2014 which recently became the first public company ever to notch a $4 trillion valuation \u2014 it was still a hit to the bottom line. China made up 13% of Nvidia\u2019s sales in 2024, and the company forecast billions in lost revenue if the ban stayed in place.\nIn exchange, they owe the government a cut of the proceeds. That\u2019s about $5 billion a year going into the Treasury coffers, for Trump to spend as he wishes, according to estimates by analyst Angelo Zino at investment firm CFRA.\nWhile the stock market\u2019s reaction to the news was muted, many investors spoke out against the deal.\n\u201cThis federal shakedown of private companies is unconstitutional,\u201d said Peter Schiff, chief economist at asset manager Europac, in apost on X.\nMike O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, wrote in note to clients that it was \u201csad that these two companies would acquiesce to such a deal,\u201d and that \u201cthey have exposed the rest of corporate America to the risk of needing to make deals with the government in order to transact business.\u201d\nWhile there doesn\u2019t seem to be any historical precedent for this particular arrangement, it is consistent with the Trump playbook.\nThe key is to leverage the power of the presidency to inflict just enoughpain \u2014 or threaten to do so \u2014 that it forces everyone to the negotiating table.\nTrump has made an intentional strategy of manufacturing crises that he later claims credit for fixing. It\u2019s a \u201cset the neighborhood on fire then show up with a hose to help your neighbors, if they can pay you\u201dapproach to governing.\nAnd Trump is not hiding this shakedown tactic \u2014 he\u2019s bragging about it.\nWhen discussing the hundreds of billions of dollars in corporate pledges and investment commitments included in recent trade agreements, Trump sees those financial commitments as a way for countries to \u201cpay down\u201d the threatened tariff rates, my colleaguePhil Mattingly wrote last week.\n\u201cI got a signing bonus from Japan of $550 billion,\u201d Trump told CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s our money. It\u2019s our money to invest, as we like.\u201d\nTrump also uses tariffs as a cudgel to encourage companies to invest in domestic production. Apple, for one, managed to carve out an exemption from future semiconductor tariffs because it announced plans last week to invest $100 billion in the US over the next five years.\nWhile this particular pay-to-play setup may be new and uncomfortable for titans of industry more accustomed to the free market ethos of the past, they may have little choice but to engage.\nBut more than that, part of the reason Trump may be so enamored with this heavy-handed capitalism is that it offers a novel (and again, not necessarily legal) way to centralize more power in the presidency.\nCongress has become a lot weaker than originally envisioned in the nearly two-and-a-half centuries since it was created, but one of its lasting powers has been the ability to tax, and the ability to spend. Let\u2019s talk about corporate taxes in general for a second and where that money has historically gone.\nCorporate tax rates have been a political rallying cry for decades on both sides of the aisle. Democrats wanted to raise them, saying that corporations with staggering profits were not paying their fair share. Republicans argued that without untaxed multitudes of income, companies would simply hire fewer people, or even lay off thousands.\nOne part that both sides agreed on \u2013 or at least never seemed to publicly question \u2013 was that any taxes collected by the government would, like any other tax, be appropriated by Congress.\nBut Trump has undermined the entire crux of the argument with a new third way.\nThe Nvidia\/AMD payouts are effectively a new form of corporate tax \u2014 one dictated to individual companies by the president, according to his singular whims, with proceeds directed to the Treasury, not to be appropriated by the legislature but to be spent as the president sees fit.\nAnd while it\u2019s a new way of doing things in the US, people in finance are using old terms to describe it.\nTrump and his advisers \u201care learning that \u2014 as contrary as it may be to the free\/efficient market capitalist ethos of the Republican party, it ticks so many other boxes that it is really irresistible to them: national security, revenue, reshoring, general industrial policy,\u201d said Daniel Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital, in an email.\n\u201cThis is a continuation of the state capitalist agenda that Trump\u2026 is clearly enamored with.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/08\/12\/business\/nightcap-trump-trade-capitalism","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

March\u2019s decline was similar to February\u2019s, underscoring the growing pessimism among US consumers.\nNot only are Americans expecting higher inflation this year, but more of them are also predicting that the economy will slip into a recession, the Conference Board survey showed. That toxic combination of weakening growth and accelerating inflationresembles \u201cstagflation,\u201dand Federal Reserve officialsalso seethe US economy trending in that direction.\nAmericans\u2019 expectations \u201cfor income, business, and labor market conditions\u201d in the coming year fell sharply this month, the survey showed, declining 9.6 points to 65.2, the lowest level in 12 years. Meanwhile, the share of respondents expecting a recession in the next 12 months held steady in March at a nine-month high.\nTrump\u2019s trade spat with foreign countries, a key tenet of his economic agenda, has been both baffling and contentious: Earlier this month after imposing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, those dutieswere quickly delayedfor another month after complaints from business leaders; then, after the European Union retaliated to Trump\u2019s metal tariffs, the president continued to up the ante by threatening a mega 200% tariff on European alcohol.\nAnd upcoming tariffs aimed at matching those that foreign countries impose on the United States \u2014 so-called reciprocal tariffs slated for April 2 \u2014might be watered down.\nThat frenetic back-and-forth has evoked high levels of uncertainty among American consumers, businesses and investors, which is making it difficult to plan ahead, according to various surveys. It\u2019s also stoking fears that the economy could be barreling toward stagflation.\nRelated live storyThe US economy added 151,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%\nStephen Miran, chair of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said he isn\u2019t concerned by the drop in consumer confidence. \u201cFolks often let their political views influence their views of the economy, which tends to manifest in the confidence data,\u201d Miran said Tuesday in a CNBC interview.\nIn his view, soft data such as the consumer confidence survey is less telling about the state of the economy compared to hard data like jobs reports, which paint a somewhat better picture.\nSarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, said soft data can manifest in hard data, but that remains to be seen.\n\u201cObviously we\u2019ve seen some wobbles in the soft data, particularly the consumer surveys, but for it to become concerning, there has to be some pass-through into the hard data, in terms of growth and the labor market,\u201d she told CNN.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s rapid-fire policy changes have also been perplexing for the Fed, which is tasked with managing borrowing costs. In addition to tariffs, the administration is also carrying out mass deportations and slashing regulations.\nCentral bankers have said recently that they\u2019re adopting a wait-and-see approach with interest rates, holding them steady as they wait for some clarity on how the US economy is responding to Trump\u2019s policies.\n\u201cThe (Fed) can react to new developments by holding at the current rate for some time as we closely monitor incoming data and the cumulative effects of new policies,\u201d Fed Governor Adriana Kugler said Tuesday at an event hosted by the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\nMost Fed officials, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have said that what matters is the \u201cnet effect\u201d of Trump\u2019s policies on growth, hiring and inflation, which are scant so far.\nRelated articleKey takeaways from the Fed\u2019s decision to hold interest rates steady amid Trump\u2019s tariff chaos\nBut there have beensome signs of economic weakness already, even before Trump\u2019s policies demonstrate any shifts in the economy. A real-time forecast of economic growth by the Atlanta Fed shows the economy contracting in the current quarter, slowing sharply from late last year. That\u2019s largely due to the effects of unusually harsh cold weather in January on consumer spending and industrial activity.\nAmerica\u2019s labor market, however,remains a sturdy pillar of strengthfor the US economy, which should bode well for spending. In February, unemployment stood at a low 4.1% as employers added a solid 151,000 jobs.\nThe Fed is also getting a concerning signal from the recent run-up in Americans\u2019 expectations for inflation in the short run and in the long run. After the Fed\u2019s latest monetary policy meeting earlier this month, Powell said long-run inflation expectations remain \u201cmostly well anchored.\u201d\nOverall, economic data currently suggests that the economy doesn\u2019t urgently need any relief from the Fed in the form of rate cuts, nor that rate hikes are needed to tamp down inflation.\n\u201cI moved to one (rate cut for this year) mainly because I think we\u2019re going to see inflation be very bumpy and not move dramatically and in a clear way to the 2% target,\u201d Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told Bloomberg Monday. \u201cBecause that\u2019s being pushed back, I think the appropriate path for policy is also going to have to be pushed back.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/25\/economy\/us-consumer-confidence-march-recession","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s trade deals are stalling out at the worst possible time","date":"2025-06-28","body":"With just a week and a half remaining of a 90-day pause on President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, the White House is running out of time to negotiate its long-promised trade deals that could bring some certainty to an increasingly uneasy economy.\nBut with just two trade frameworks inked and dozens to go before the July 9 deadline, that timeframe appears increasingly unlikely \u2014 just as America\u2019s economy might be taking a turn for the worse.\nFor months, the Trump administration has said deals are imminent, working with 18 key partners to lower trade barriers while hundreds of other countries wait in line to get out from under the burden of higher tariffs. But the timeframe continues to shift.\n\u201cI\u2019ve made all the deals,\u201d Trump said in aTime interviewin late April, saying trade negotiations with foreign partners were nearly complete. \u201cI\u2019ve made 200 deals.\u201d\nMore than two weeks later,Trump acknowledgedthat hundreds or even dozens of deals aren\u2019t possible on such a short timeframe \u2014 a point he reiterated Friday at a press briefing at the White House.\n\u201cYou know, we have 200 countries,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that. So at a certain point, over the next week and a half or so, or maybe before, we\u2019re going to send out a letter. We talked to many of the countries, and we\u2019re just going to tell them what they have to pay to do business in the United States. And it\u2019s going to go very quickly.\u201d\nThat notion of establishing new tariffs for countries that can\u2019t or won\u2019t reach a deal with the United States has been floating around for over two months, but the timeline keeps getting pushed back. On April 23, Trump said his administrationwould \u201cset the tariff\u201dfor countries that fail to negotiate new terms in the following few weeks. OnMay 16, Trump said that \u201cat a certain point, over the next two to three weeks \u2026 we\u2019ll be telling people what they\u2019ll be paying to do business in the United States.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the United States remains in active negotiations with its key trading partners. But those deals have been promised for months, too, with little to show for it. On June 11, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a flood of deals was coming.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see deal after deal, they\u2019re going to start coming next week and the week after and the week after. We\u2019ve got them in the hopper,\u201dhe told CNBC. On Thursday, Lutnicktold Bloomberg10 deals would be announced imminently.\nBut White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also said Thursday that \u201cthe deadline is not critical,\u201d a point that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized to Fox Business on Friday:Bessent saidhe thinks trade negotiations could be \u201cwrapped up\u201d by Labor Day, providing a more relaxed framework for inking deals than the previouslyprescribed July 9 deadline.\nMeanwhile, Trump made clear Friday that trade policy could continue to grow more aggressive. In a social media message Friday, he said that the United States waspulling out of trade talkswith Canada because of its digital services tax and that the administration would set a new tariff for its northern neighbor within the next week.\nAnd Bessent told CNBC Friday that about 20 countries could return to their \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff rate starting on July 9, while others would receive longer windows to negotiate. He didn\u2019t name the countries that would receive the higher levies, but some nations\u2019 tariffs were set as high as 50% before Trump hit pause.\n\u201cThe idea that uncertainty will be resolved early this summer appears to be completely dead,\u201d Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, told CNN. \u201cThis means tariff aggression is not dead. That\u2019s probably not super surprising but some of us allowed ourselves moments of optimism.\u201d\nThe problem with the perpetually pushed-back tariff timetable is that the economy could really use some deals right about now.\nAfter several months of strong economic news but incredibly weak consumer sentiment, America is starting to see those trends reverse: The vibes are on the rebound, but evidence is mounting that the economy is getting worse.\nConsumer sentiment climbed 16% this month, the University of Michigan said in its latest survey released Friday. Although consumer sentiment remains weak, thestock market is at an all-time high, which could give Americans a confidence boost.\nBut that\u2019s not translating into spending.Consumer spending unexpectedly fellin May for the first time since January, the Commerce Department reported Friday. In real terms, consumer spending has now fallen so far in 2025.\nInflation is ticking higher, job growth is slowing andretail sales are sinking. That\u2019s a concern, because consumer spending makes up two-thirds of America\u2019s economy.\n\u201cHouseholds are anxious about what tariff-induced price hikes will do to their spending power, while concerns about the robustness of the jobs market are on the rise,\u201d said James Knightley, chief US economist for ING, in a note to clients Friday. \u201cEquity markets have recovered and are at all-time highs, but house prices nationally are starting to come under downward pressure.\u201d\nMany mainstream economists argue that the low inflation of the spring that helped boost consumer sentiment represents acalm before the summer storm, when they expect prices to rise as companies finish selling off inventories of products they had brought to the United States before Trump imposed tariffs. Friday\u2019s inflation report showed that the changeover to higher-tariff goods may have already begun to happen.\n\u201cHigher prices from tariffs may be starting to work their way through the economy,\u201d said Robert Ruggirello, chief investment officer at Brave Eagle Wealth Management.\nAlthough tax cuts from Trump\u2019s sweeping domestic policy agenda could help mitigate higher prices from tariffs, Trump\u2019s trade war continues to risk retaliation from American\u2019s key trading partners. Higher tariffs from foreign countries could slow the US economy, risking a recession.\n\u201cTrading partners taking retaliatory action could have a lasting impact on US output and, accordingly, public finances,\u201d said Michel Nies, an economist at Citi.\nThat\u2019s why trade deals are so urgent: America\u2019s economy remains strong, but cracks are forming. Tariffs are a big reason why. More delays will generate more uncertainty. And those good vibes could turn bad pretty quickly.\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/28\/economy\/trade-deals-tariffs-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

His policies of tax cuts were expected to spur economic growth and tariffs were expected to reduce demand for foreign imports, boosting the greenback\u2019s value.\nYet the dollar had broadly weakened this year as Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 and his back-and-forth decisions on implementing them, pausing them, raising them and lowering them \u2014 have injected uncertainty into markets and clouded the outlook for the US economy.\nWhile tariffs can technically boost the dollar, they also have created an uncertainty about US policy that has \u201cdominated\u201d markets this year, driving the dollar lower, Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics and political science at UC Berkeley, told CNN.\n\u201cInvestors don\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d Eichengreen said, noting the negative impact on the dollar. While uncertainty around the US economy has increased, the European economy \u2014 though facing its own headwinds from tariffs \u2014 has emerged as relatively more stable.\n\u201cThe consensus out there is that US growth is slowing owing to uncertainty around Trump\u2019s tariffs and other things,\u201d Eichengreen said. \u201cThe weakness of the dollar may also reflect new doubts about the currency\u2019s safe haven status.\u201d\nA weaker dollar could support American exporters by making their goods relatively more affordable in the global market.

{"title":"Trump made trade his biggest issue. Now he\u2019s running out of time","date":"2025-06-19","body":"Despite unprecedented immigration raids, a massive domestic policy agenda and now the prospect of actual war, President Donald Trump\u2019s first five months in office have nevertheless been dominated by his trade war. He notched some recent wins, but Trump is rapidly running out of time to seal the deal.\nOr, more accurately,deals. More than 100 of them.\nAfter pausing his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs that sent levies surging for dozens of countries\u2019 exports to the United States, Trump has sought to make a number of bilateral trade deals that would open American businesses\u2019 access to foreign markets and boost US manufacturing. The deadline is July 9. Trump has justtwodealsto show for his efforts over the past two months.\nTrump and other world leaders had hoped to use the G7 meeting in Canada this week to hammer out more. The announcement of new deals could have solidified confidence that the US and global economies could avoid a recession this year \u2013 a major question mark that most economists believed was a distinct possibility just a few weeks ago.\nThe degree to which Trump \u2013 his preferences and, more importantly, his aversions \u2013 shaped the structure, logistics, schedule and deliverables planned for the summit underscored the shared view of Trump\u2019s singular importance in this moment.\nIt was Trump\u2019s time that was most coveted, and the subject of intense efforts in the weeks before to secure bilateral sit-downs or pull-aside chats on the sidelines of the official events, US and foreign officials said.\nBut thenTrump left the G7 early on Mondayto deal with the escalating Israel-Iran conflict. He left behind his economic team, but Trump\u2019s early and unexpected departure removed the key piece from a complex trade puzzle.\nNow Trump has four weeks left to score those deals, set the clock forward again or announce higher tariff rates \u2013 all while he\u2019s increasingly occupiedwith a military conflict in the Middle Eastthat could quickly become a wider war with direct US involvement.\nTrump and his economic team have long promised deals that have been \u201ccoming soon\u201d for weeks. So far, only the United Kingdom and China have agreed to frameworks for US trade negotiations.The UK signed its agreementat the G7 this week. And China met US trade representatives in the United Kingdom last week andagreed to the terms of a previous arrangementafter tensions escalated in recent weeks.\nBut Commerce SecretaryHoward Lutnick once again promisedlast week that new trade deals are right around the corner.\n\u201cThere are so many coming,\u201d Lutnick told CNBC last Wednesday. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see deal after deal, they\u2019re going to start coming next week and the week after and the week after. We\u2019ve got them in the hopper.\u201d\nThose predictions have been wrong. Every time.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has repeatedly said the administration is in active negotiations with 18 trading partners after reaching those tentative agreements with the UK and China.\nSo where are the deals? Lutnick said last week Trump is in no rush, preferring to hammer out better agreements that benefit American businesses and consumers.\n\u201cGood shape isn\u2019t good enough for the United States of America. We want great deals that are fundamental for America,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cWe can get them done. We need to open these other countries\u2019 markets. Our farmers, our ranchers, our fisherman, they are going to have just a great time. Our machinists are going to sell a lot of equipment overseas.\u201d\nThe key factor, Lutnick said, is opening up foreign markets that impose tariffs and other non-tariff trade barriers such as taxes and export controls that limit American companies\u2019 access to those countries.\nAt the G7, the US and Canada agreed to a 30-day timeline for a bilateral agreement, but a Canadian proposal privately broached with Trump that exchanged defense spending increases for a reprieve from Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs didn\u2019t appear to gain any traction, two officials said.\nA pull aside between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba didn\u2019t yield the agreement that Japanese officials had hoped for weeks could be finalized at the summit.\nMeanwhile, Trump left behind in Canada a number of world leaders with frayed nerves but no new trade deals at the clock ticks down to zero.\n\u201cThey\u2019re either going to make a good deal or they\u2019ll just pay whatever we say they have to pay,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked about progress in negotiations with the European Union during the trip back to Washington.\nMoments later, Trump was asked about the status of talks with Japan.\n\u201cThe Japanese are tough,\u201d Trump said a few minutes later when asked about negotiations with Japan. \u201cBut ultimately you have to understand we\u2019re just going to send a letter saying \u2018this is what you\u2019re going to pay, otherwise you don\u2019t have to do business with us.\u2019\u201d\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesdaysaid tariffs have already raised prices on some goods \u2013 especially electronics \u2013 and inflation could spike in the coming months as higher import taxes make their way through the system.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re beginning to see some effects. We expect to see more,\u201d Powell said during his post-meeting press conference. \u201cWe\u2019ve had goods inflation just moving up a bit, and, of course, we do expect to see more of that over the course of the summer.\u201d\nPowell noted that many goods being sold at retailers today may have been imported months ago, before tariffs were imposed. So it could take time before inflation takes hold.\n\u201cMany, many companies do expect to put all or some of the effect of tariffs through to the next person in the chain, and, ultimately, to the consumer,\u201d Powell said.\nFed members in their quarterly economic forecasts on Wednesday predicted inflation would rise higher over the next couple years than they had expected in March. They also said the economy would grow more slowly and unemployment would rise more quickly than they previously believed.\nPowell noted that the reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from 145% was a relief. But the big question for the economy remains: Will tariffs move higher in the summer after the 90-day \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff pause expires for so many other countries.\n\u201cThe effects of tariffs will depend on their ultimate level,\u201d Powell said. \u201cExpectations of the level and economic effects reached a peak in April and have since declined. Even so, increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.\u201d\nWhile Powell took a soothing approach on Wednesday, the urgent deadline is viewed around the world as an acute threat to domestic economies and industries if agreements aren\u2019t reached.\nFor Trump, it\u2019s leverage.\nAfter all, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, \u201cwe\u2019re making a lot of money.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/19\/economy\/trump-trade-deals-g7","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"GM says it will invest $4 billion to increase US production","date":"2025-06-10","body":"General Motors said on Tuesday that it would invest $4 billion into three US plants to boost production of gas and electric vehicles, as a 25% tariff on imported cars by President Donald Trump threatens the bottom lines of automakers that sell in the United States.\nIt was not immediately clear how much of the $4 billion had already been announced or committed.\nThe automaker\u2019s plan reflects the rush by manufacturers to invest in the United States to sidestep Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2013 or at least to make splashy, eye-catching announcements that could win them a reprieve.\nGM CEO Mary Barra previously told CNN that the 25% tariff on cars (and on imported auto parts) would cost the companybetween $4 billion and $5 billion in 2025.\nTrump has levied tariffs on several sectors, includinga 50% tariff on steel and aluminumthat also could hurt automakers, as well as 10% tariffs on US trading partners generally. But he\u2019s also paused, increased, walked back and modified many of his tariffs, leading to confusion among investors, importers and businesses that are trying to figure out how to stay afloat.\nThe GM investment will go into three locations, the company said in a release: Orion Assembly in Orion Township, Michigan; Fairfax Assembly in Kansas City, Kansas; and Spring Hill Manufacturing in Spring Hill, Tennessee.\nGM\u2019s contract with the United Auto Workers in 2023 promised an additional investment in both the Orion and Fairfax assemblies. The contract does not mention a Spring Hill investment.\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the US and to support American jobs,\u201d Barra said in GM\u2019s statement.\nGM spokesman Kevin Kelly said the investment announced Tuesday was in addition to the additional investment that the company had promised to make as part of its 2023 labor agreement with the United Auto Workers union.\nGM\u2019s announcement did not say the company was shifting any production from its foreign auto plants to the United States, although the gasoline-powered version of the Blazer, which will now be built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, is current built in Mexico.\nIt had previously announced that it was increasing production of the Silverado pickup at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, plant, but it did not announce plans to cut Mexican or Canadian production of those best-selling pickup trucks.\nIn 2024, GM built nearly 1 million cars in Canada and Mexico, according to figures from S&P Global Mobility, compared to 1.7 million it built at US factories. Most of those Mexican and Canadian built cars were shipped to GM\u2019s US dealerships.\nIt also imported an additional 415,000 cars it built in South Korea to US dealerships, with about half of those sales the Trax compact SUV. And it imported 47,000 Buick Envision SUVs from China. Other than the gasoline-powered Blazer, of which it sold about 53,000 last year, GM has no immediate plans to shift foreign production to US facilities, Kelly said.\nThe United Auto Workers union praised GM\u2019s move \u2013 and Trump\u2019s use of tariffs.\n\u201cWhile other companies drag their feet, GM is showing that strategic auto tariffs work with a massive $4 billion investment that will create thousands of good paying union jobs,\u201d UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time to invest in blue collar America, and GM is showing how it\u2019s done. This is just the beginning.\u201d\nTrump has been vocal in demanding companies move production to the United States, one ofthe stated goals of his tariff campaign, which will touch products across a broad swath of American life.\nGM was the first major company to estimate a dollar amount for its costs from Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs.\nMany other companieshave walked back earnings forecastsbecause of the ensuing economic uncertainty or have said they will likely raise prices at some point this year. Ford, for example, said it expects to raise itsUS car prices as much as 1.5% in the second half of 2025 due to the import levies.\nWhile GM is not the dominant global auto player it once was, it is still the largest automaker in terms of American sales, with 2.7 million cars and trucks sold in the US last year. And all of those cars and trucks, not just the imports, are vulnerable to Trump\u2019s tariffs to some extent.\nEven the 1.7 million cars and trucks GM built in the US last year depended on imported parts to some degree (although some of the tariffs on imported car parts can be mitigated for domestic manufacturers).\nCNN\u2019s Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/10\/business\/gm-four-billion-us-production-investment","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"Trump says the clock is ticking for 150 countries to make a deal or face higher tariffs","date":"2025-05-16","body":"If you thought President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war was over, he has some news for you: Tariffs are going up again.\nAt the conclusion of his Middle East trip Friday, Trump acknowledged thattrade negotiationsare progressing too slowly to accommodate every country that wants to strike a new trade deal with the United States. So Trump said he\u2019d give other countries a few more weeks, and then Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick would simply tell America\u2019s trading partners what their new tariffs are.\n\u201cWe have, at the same time, 150 countries that want to make a deal, but you\u2019re not able to see that many countries,\u201d Trump said during a business roundtable in Abu Dhabi Friday. \u201cSo at a certain point, over the next two to three weeks, I think Scott and Howard will be sending letters out, essentially telling people \u2013 we\u2019ll be very fair \u2013 but we\u2019ll be telling people what they\u2019ll be paying to do business in the United States.\u201d\nTrump on April 9paused his massive so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he announced on what he called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d on April 2. The reprieve was supposed to be for 90 days, to allow countries to negotiate with the administration. Trump officials have said around 100 countries have offered to negotiate deals, setting atremendously difficult taskbefore US trade negotiators to race against the clock to make new commitments.\nWithout those negotiated deals, Trump could impose reciprocal tariffs \u2013 some of which are as high as 50%. The tariffs aren\u2019ttechnically reciprocal, and many smaller countries with large trade gaps with the United States would end up with significant tariff burdens.\n\u201cI guess you could say they could appeal it, but for the most part I think we\u2019re going to be very fair, but it\u2019s not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump has floated a similar idea before, albeit on a timeframe that has since elapsed.\nOn April 23, in the Oval Office, Trump said his administrationwould \u201cset the tariff\u201dfor countries that fail to negotiate new terms in the following few weeks.\n\u201cIn the end, I think what\u2019s going to happen is we\u2019re going to have great deals, and by the way, if we don\u2019t have a deal with a company or a country, we\u2019re going to set the tariff,\u201d Trump said last month. \u201cI\u2019d say over the next couple of weeks, wouldn\u2019t you say? I think so. Over the next two, three weeks. We\u2019ll be setting the number.\u201d\nSo far, the Trump administration has managed to announce two new frameworks for trade negotiations that resulted in lower tariffs or lower trade barriers with other countries. The first was with the United Kingdom, announced earlier this month, and the second was with China, which Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer negotiated in Geneva last weekend.\nTrump\u2019s negotiators have said they are in active discussions with a dozen or so countries, and Trump has said he is close to announcing several more agreements. The administration has previously said India and Japan are getting close to a framework of a deal, as is South Korea, although a new government is coming in there, which will delay negotiations.\nIt\u2019s not clear what new tariffs Trump will set on countries that are unable to strike a deal with the United States in the coming weeks \u2013 and whether those new tariffs will permanently supersede the paused reciprocal tariffs or merely serve as an interim tariff while negotiations continue. In the meantime, the United States maintains a 10% universal tariff on virtually every good imported to America, plus higher rates for certain products.\nAlthough Lutnick and some other administration officials have described the 10% tariff as a \u201cbaseline,\u201d Trump earlier this month rejected that notion, suggesting that US importers would pay a tariff of more than 10% to bring in goods from most countries.\nAfter announcing the framework for trade negotiations with the UK, Trump said other countries wouldn\u2019t get such a good deal. Unlike the UK, whose tariff was set at 10%, other countries will pay a higher rate, Trump said.\nThat means tariffs will go higher than where they are today: according to Fitch Ratings, even with the 90-day reciprocal tariff pause, set to expire July 8, the United States maintains a 13% average tariff rate on imported goods. Although that\u2019s lower than the 23% in effect last week, before the Trump administration agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese goods, it\u2019s way higher than the 2.3% average tariff rate from before Trump took office for the second time.\nThey could go much higher: Trump last month said he\u2019ddeclare \u201ctotal victory\u201dif import taxes were as high as 50% a year from now.\nTrump\u2019s back-and-forth stance on tariffs has caused incredible uncertainty for businesses and consumers, and mainstream economists say the chances of a US recession \u2013 though falling as Trump has backed off many of his most aggressive trade policies \u2013 are roughly a coin flip. It has also rattled markets, sending stocks tumbling before they rebounded over the past several weeks as Trump has expressed openness to negotiations on trade.\nTrump has previously said his administration is rapidly constructing scores of deals that could make trade with other nations fairer and bring manufacturing back to the United States.\n\u201cYou have to understand, I\u2019m dealing with all the companies, very friendly countries. We\u2019re meeting with China. We\u2019re doing fine with everybody. But ultimately, I\u2019ve made all the deals,\u201d Trump said in aTime interview last month. \u201cI\u2019ve made 200 deals.\u201d\nTrump said in the interview, conducted in late April, that he would announce those deals \u201cover the next three to four weeks.\u201d That same week, Trump said he\u2019d announce those deals in two to three weeks\u2019 time.\nDespite Trump and his administration\u2019s rhetoric, actual trade deals take a lot of time \u2013 often years \u2013 to hash out. They typically involve incredibly complex agreements, delving into the minutiae of various goods and nontariff barriers. They often involve significant political considerations, as various parties seek to protect voters with special interests.\nSo Trump\u2019s concession Friday that hundreds or even dozens of deals aren\u2019t possible on such a short timeframe shows the limitations of threatening tariffs in order to achieve rapid concessions from trading partners with their own vested interests. In the meantime, Americans will be paying more for goods that aren\u2019t made in the United States.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/16\/business\/trade-deals-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The VIX was up 8% in the afternoon after surging as much as 23% in the morning.\nThe US dollar index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against six major foreign currencies, slid 0.8%. The dollar index posted its biggest single-day drop in one month and notched its worst week in six weeks. Gold, a safe haven during uncertainty, surged 2%.\n\u201cMarkets once again face the fear of high tariffs on a major trading partner,\u201d said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management.\n\u201cWe believe that this morning\u2019s social media posts about a 50% tariff on the EU are primarily a negotiating tactic,\u201d analysts at Barclays said in a Friday note. \u201cBut today\u2019s developments, including the posts about iPhones, do highlight that the US has not turned the page on tariffs and that more trade policy volatility lies ahead.\u201d\nWall Street in recent weeks had begun to shift focus away from tariffs and toward Trump\u2019stax bill\u2014 its ownheadache for markets\u2014 after the United States and China in May opened trade negotiations and agreed to substantially lower tariffs, easing investors\u2019 nerves about the trade war.\nBut Trump\u2019s new threat of tariffs on the EU was a sharp reminder that policy uncertainty remains. David Doyle, head of economics at Macquarie, said in a recent note that it is not \u201call-clear\u201d on the trade war front, and tariffs remain a \u201csubstantial headwind\u201d to the US economy.\n\u201cToday\u2019s early market action does not approve of a threat directed at another corporate, and the idea of a 50% EU tariff rate,\u201d analysts at Citi said in a Friday note. \u201cThis is sure giving us d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d\nThe S&P 500 sank in early April after Trump announced massive \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, and rebounded sharply after the president a week later announced a 90-day pause on most of them. Investors have been on edge about potential developments during the 90-day pause, which is set to end in July.\n\u201cThis calls into question whether investors can trust that any pauses announced by the Administration are actually solid, which only further muddies the landscape,\u201d said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. \u201cExpect volatility to persist.\u201d\nScott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments, said the market reaction to Trump\u2019s threat of 50% tariffs on the EU will likely be more \u201cmeasured\u201d than past tariff announcements because \u201cthe playbook now involves a high likelihood of Trump caving at some point.\u201d\n\u201cBut the uncertain timing and not-zero chance that he doesn\u2019t cave will keep equities on edge for the next couple of weeks, at least,\u201d Ladner said.\nThe United States so far during the 90-day pause has only announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom.\nApple (AAPL) on Friday dropped 3% after Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on the company\u2019s products unless it moves manufacturing to the United States. The tech giant has tumbled 22% this year as it has been caught in the crossfire of Trump\u2019s trade war.\nApple\u2019s market value dipped back below the $3 trillion mark on Friday as its stock stumbled.\nAnd it\u2019s not just Big Tech taking a hit. Retirement plans like 401(k)s are often invested in funds that track the S&P 500, and large companies like Apple make up a notable portion of the index\u2019s value. As Trump\u2019s trade war roils blue-chip stocks like Apple, it can impact people\u2019s retirement savings.\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t continue to keep an economy and companies operating in a cloud of extraordinarily high uncertainty forever without some economic consequences eventually,\u201d Ladner said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the tug of war the next several months.\u201d\nThe tariff jolt on Friday comes after markets this week have already been floundering under pressure from the bond market. Investors this week balked at Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d tax bill, and weak demand for US government bonds sent yields surging.\nRelated articleWhy the bond market is so worried about the \u2018Big, Beautiful Bill\u2019\n\u201cMarkets are looking for a little more fiscal discipline, they\u2019re concerned,\u201d Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller told Fox Business on Thursday.\n\u201cThere does seem to be, you know, a risk-off on American assets across the board, not just government debt, but everything,\u201d Waller said. \u201cAnd whether that continues in the future or not, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note on Friday edged lower to 4.51% as investors scooped up bonds amid renewed trade uncertainty.\nIn Europe, markets tumbled after Trump\u2019s threat of a higher tariff for the region that could go into effect June 1. The benchmark STOXX 600 index fell 0.93%. Germany\u2019s DAX fell 1.54% and France\u2019s CAC index slid 1.65%.\nThe S&P 500 posted its fourth day of losses in a row as the recent rebound in US markets has stalled.

{"title":"The White House has been obsessed with tariffs. Wall Street is wondering about Trump\u2019s tax cuts","date":"2025-05-16","body":"As the US and China came to an agreement to lower tariffs sharply this week, trade war uncertainty has, for now, subsided. But Wall Street has a new question for President Donald Trump: What about tax cuts?\nLawmakers this week are debating Trump\u2019s tax agenda, which includes extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and adding potential tax cuts on tips, overtime pay and Social Security. That \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d could have, well, big implications for the economy \u2014 and for stocks and bonds.\nA lower tax burden could could mean more money for consumers, the engine of the economy, to splash out at stores, in addition to providing a boost to Wall Street. But Trump\u2019s tax cuts could also increase the deficit, and investors might demand higher interest rates to hold US debt.\nAlan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, told CNN that he thinks investors could balk if the tax bill lowers taxes without cuts to government spending as well.\n\u201cI think there may still be some belief in markets that there\u2019s going to be large spending cuts, and I think when they find out there really aren\u2019t, that might have some impact,\u201d he said.\nRelated articleHere\u2019s what\u2019s in the House GOP\u2019s sweeping tax and spending cuts package\nWhile many investors have been enthusiastic about potential tax cuts, concerns about the federal debt have also increased substantially since 2017, when Trump\u2019s first tax cuts were passed, Auerbach said.\nThe ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product, or the total value of goods and services produced in the economy, was 123% in 2024, up from 104% in 2017, according to the Treasury Department. A higher debt-to-GDP ratio signals the government might have \u201cgreater difficulty in repaying its debt,\u201d according toTreasury Department.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now talking about deficits and a national debt-to-GDP ratio that are really going to be unprecedented, except for recent recessionary times,\u201d Auerbach said.\nWhile Trump is set on extending his tax cuts, there just aren\u2019t that many places in the federal budget to cut spending, he said.\nVolatility has settled this month as Trump walked back his most aggressive tariff policies. As the focus turns to tax cuts, which Republicans hope to sign into law this summer, investors will be keen to see whether the president\u2019s tax agenda provides a boost to markets or shakes confidence in US assets.\nInvestors\u2019 ire (or joy) could come out in the bond market, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, told CNN.\n\u201cI think we have to watch closely the bond market, because it will give us a signal as to whether it dislikes whatever Trump does with taxes,\u201d Stovall said.\nTrump\u2019s tariff chaos spooked markets deeply last month, making investors nervous about US assets. As a result, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose about 50 basis points the week ending April 11, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase. That was the largest weekly increase since 2001, they said.\nRelated articleThe bond market is acting weird. It spooked Trump\nUS Treasuries have typically been considered a safe haven and the best kind of place to park your cash during tough times. But the ongoing worries about the deficit could keep Treasuries volatile, the JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote, or at least give investors pause about holding long-term US debt.\nA March report by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts would add to the federal debt, which the report said is already on an unsustainable path.\n\u201cThey (lawmakers) should not add further to the debt by enacting or extending tax cuts and spending without offsets,\u201d the report said. \u201cDoing so could spark a debt spiral and impose significant costs on current and future generations.\u201d\nFor now, investors are largely waiting to see what happens, said Chip Hughey, managing director for fixed income at Truist Advisory Services.\n\u201cIt is still too early to tell what the ultimate impact the final tax bill will have on the US Treasury market,\u201d Hughey said.\nRepublicans still have plenty to work out in the tax bill, Berkeley\u2019s Auerbach pointed out. Not all the proposed changes are likely to make it in.\nWhile Capitol Hill and Wall Street begin to think more about tax cuts, the worries about tariffs haven\u2019t entirely gone away, either.\nTariff rates still remain substantially higher than before Trump took office, and investors are waiting for more economic data to see how American consumers are faring, Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management Group, told CNN.\nMore trade agreements could be coming, and the frameworks of the deals announced so far still need to be fleshed out, Hainlin said.\n\u201cI think perhaps going into the year, there was a hope that there would be more of a clearly defined sequence, and not this sort of parallel processing of all of these initiatives at once,\u201d Hainlin said.\nThe lack of a \u201cclearly defined sequence\u201d means that, at least for now, the path for the US economy remains particularly unclear.\n\u201cEven with the trade deal with China and suspension of reciprocal tariffs against other trade partners, tariffs remain a substantial headwind for the US economy,\u201d David Doyle, head of economics atMacquarie, said in a Tuesday note. \u201cWhile a positive development, the de-escalation does not mean that everything is \u2018all clear\u2019 on the trade war front.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/16\/markets\/us-stock-market-tax-cuts-tariffs-treasury-bonds","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s trade war is about to change the way you shop","date":"2025-05-09","body":"You\u2019re about to feel the effects of President Donald Trump\u2019strade warevery time you shop.\nIn a matter of weeks, infinite varieties, colors, sizes and flavors will be replaced with smaller selections, fewer options and limited choice. It will represent a stark change from what consumers have been accustomed to at stores and online.\nAs free trade blossomed over the past five decades, the number of imported goods on shelvestripledbetween 1972 and 2001, research shows, equivalent to a 2.6% rise in GDP. Grocery stores now stock around 30,000 different items, Walmart sells 120,000 goods at its superstores and Amazon\u2019s online catalog contains millions of products.\nBut Trump has implemented a 10% universal tariff on virtually every product entering the United States \u2014 with higher rates for certain goods \u2014 and 145% tariffs on China, essentially a trade embargo on the world\u2019s second largest economy. That could limit choices for shoes, bags, toys and many other products.\n\u201cTo me, that\u2019s going to be one of the biggest casualties of tariffs. You\u2019re going to see far less variety than you would have otherwise,\u201d said Jason Miller, a professor in supply chain management at Michigan State University.\nAlready, companies are struggling with tough decisions over which products they can still offer under the steep tariffs, eliminating items that are either too expensive to produce or that shoppers will abandon over price hikes. Companies are cancelling products made in China and buying only their top-selling items from manufacturers in other countries where they can negotiate lower prices. They are also suspending product launches and new innovations they\u2019ve spent years preparing.\nMany companies compare the havoc of Trump\u2019s tariffs on supply chains to factory shutdowns during the pandemic. But consumers should not expect similar levels of empty store shelves or a run on toilet paper, Miller said.\n\u201cRather than empty shelves, there\u2019s going to be a lot less choice in certain product categories,\u201d he said.\nFor new moms, tariffs mean Sarah Wells\u2019 best-selling version of herbreast pump backpackswill only be sold in black or one other color,such as brown or gray, once she runs out of inventory.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t offer four other colors right now,\u201d said Wells, the founder of an eponymous brand of backpacks, totes and other breast-feeding products.\nWells halted ordering products from China last monthbecause of the 145% tariffs. She found a manufacturer in Cambodia,but intentionally limited her first inventory order to bags with the highest demand and profit margins.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t justify the risk of a full catalog reorder,\u201d she said.\nWells expects to be sold out of some of her top sellers by July. Some items may not return until next year, if ever.\nOn the website forAsh, an upscale women\u2019s shoe brand, boots are completely gone and only a few ballet flats are left on sale.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen our page look like this,\u201d said Marina Rosin Levine, the CEO of Highline United, which owns Ash and Isaac Mizrahi and produces private-label footwear.\nAsh pulled boots off the site to hold them for the fall, unsure if there will be enough inventory during the season, she said. It also cut product orders from China and narrowed its orders from its manufacturers in Vietnam.\n\u201cRight now, a woman like myself would be excited to get fall boots on discount,\u201d Rosin Levine said. \u201cThis would be a great time to pick up a deal. You\u2019re going to see less and less of that.\u201d\nBig-name brands are also paring down.\nHasbro, the owner of Nerf, Play-Doh and other toys and games, is cutting some items that won\u2019t be profitable with 145% tariffs on China, Hasbro finance chief Gina Goetter said on an earnings call in April.\nRoughly 80% oftoys sold in the United Statesare made in China, according to the Toy Association, an industry group.\nIn US stores, Hasbro plans to favor older, \u201ctried and true\u201d toys produced in India over products from China. The Chinese-produced toys include items with electronics, high-end decorations and foam materials, the company said.\nNewell Brands, the maker of Graco, Baby Jogger and other consumer goods\u2019 brands, will also reduce the variety of baby gear it sells because of tariffs on China. Around 97% of baby strollers and 87% of children\u2019s car seats in the United States are sourced from China, the company said.\n\u201cWe have encouraged our business leaders and brand managers to embrace another round\u201d of product cuts, Newell CEO Christopher Peterson said on an earnings call last week. The company in recent years has cut its product variety from 100,000 items to under 20,000 to slash costs and eliminate duplicative products.\nDiscount retailers Dollar Tree and Five Below, clothing brand Vince and Acco Brands \u2014 the maker of Mead, Five Star notebooks and Swigline staplers \u2014 have also signaled they will discontinue some items because of tariffs.\n\u201cThere will definitely be a little bit of (product) reduction,\u201d Vince finance chief Yuji Okumura said on a call with analysts last week. \u201cThere are just some things that won\u2019t make sense\u201d to import at such high tariff levels.\nThe tariff fallout won\u2019t just limit consumers\u2019 choice \u2014 it will also stunt innovation and create winners and losers in the retail industry, companies and trade researchers say.\nTariffs mark the end of the corporate strategy to offer all things to all customers, said Shawn Nelson, the CEO of furniture retailer Lovesac. The companies in best position to succeed in this new era of protectionism will be more specialized and have slimmer product catalogs.\n\u201cThe broader a company\u2019s assortment and catalog is, the more at risk they are to cancel product lines,\u201d Nelson said.\nConsumers may see fewer new products come along, if they come at all.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been wanting to make other creative small appliances, and at this moment we\u2019re going to be shelving those ideas,\u201d said Bobby Djavaheri, the president ofYedi Houseware, a kitchen and small appliances\u2019 company, told CNN.\nSarah Wells has also stopped creating new designs of bags and styles, a retreat from her business mission.\n\u201cThat was a big part of what I founded my business on \u2014 giving moms choices about the bags and where to take them,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new in the hopper right now.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/09\/business\/product-choices-toys-clothing-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nTracking the trade war in 2025 feels a bit like getting repeatedly punched in the gut.\nWe suddenly have a 90-day detente ina manufactured crisis: The US has lowered its 145% tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30%, and China has reduced its 125% tariffs to 10%.\nIn the distorted reality of Trump 2.0, that slightly lighter punch in the gut is what counts as relief.\n(For the \u201cArrested Development\u201d fans out there: Remember when Gob keeps punching Buster as a motivational tactic, saying, \u201cNow, when you do this without getting punched, you\u2019ll have more fun\u201d? That\u2019s more or less how businesses are feeling.)\nMarkets soaredon the China news Monday, recouping all the losses that had piled up after the president\u2019sApril 2 tariff rollout.\nBut let\u2019s be clear: Wall Street is cheering not because 30% tariffs are suchgreatnews \u2014 they\u2019re cheering because it looks like President Donald Trump may not have the stomach for his own radical economic policy after all.\nUnder any other circumstances, markets would have panicked over 30% tariffs on America\u2019s third-largest trading partner \u2014 along with 10% universal tariffs and 25% sector-specific tariffs. But after weeks of tariff turmoil, Trump has already pushed financial markets to the brink, creating a baseline expectation of economic pain.\nIf investors were popping Champagne on Monday, it was not because they think we\u2019re out of the woods but because the odds of a recession have gone from likely to more of a coin flip.\nRelated articleTrump\u2019s China trade breakthrough might be enough to avoid self-inflicted recession\nEven with the latest detente, consumer prices are expected to rise nearly 2% because of the tariffs that remain in place \u2014 amounting to $2,800 per household for the year, according to an analysis by theYale Budget Lab. Job losses are expected to hit an extra 456,000 by the end of the year, pushing the unemployment rate up an additional 0.4 percentage point by the end of 2025, the report said.\nUS economic growth is still expected to slow, Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, said in a note Monday. She added that \u201cthere already has been some dampening effects on activity, andDOGE-related effortsto reduce the size of the government will also weigh on employment and activity later this year.\u201d\nThe Trump administration\u2019s bigger-than-expected pullback on Chinese tariffs underscores businesses\u2019 major complaint, which is that Trump\u2019s goals and priorities appear to shift by the hour.\n\u201cWhat are the chances that we have 90 days of calm ahead of us?\u201d economist Justin Wolferstold my colleague Matt Eganon Monday. \u201cToday we have good news, but what would really be good news is if someone just took the button away from him.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, the White House touted the China breakthrough over the weekend as another Trump win on the heels of a \u201clandmark trade deal\u201d with the United Kingdom last week (which,as I wrote then, was not actually a deal so much as an intent to work toward a deal that would ultimately affect only a sliver of America\u2019s global trade pie).\nYes, a 30% tax is certainly more manageable than 145%. That 115-percentage-point drop could be the difference between a totalsupply chain meltdownand a mere slowdown in trade between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nBut the agreement with China is only a \u201cwin\u201d if you squint through a MAGA lens.

{"title":"One trade \u2018deal\u2019 done, 199 to go","date":"2025-05-08","body":"President Donald Trump has finallygotten his first trade dealdone.\nWell, not quite a \u201cdeal,\u201d per se. More like a concept of a plan: a framework for negotiations between the United States and the United Kingdom that will take place between the two countries over the next several months or years \u2026 to hammer out a potential future trade agreement \u2026 that may or may not ultimately prove more beneficial to the United States than the existing trade situation.\nBut a win\u2019s a win, and this is a big win for Trump. The agreement with the UK also gives other world leaders a reason to hope that other deals can rescue the global economy from the abyss, providing a framework for future negotiations.\nAsked whether the deal is an improvement on the trading relationship of six months ago, before Trump took office, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer replied Thursday: \u201cThe question you should be asking is: Is it better than where we were yesterday?\u201d\nUndeniably, the answer is yes. Even if thedetails of the framework are sparse, tariffs on some UK goods will go down, and it could open up the market for some more US goods to enter the UK.\nNow, the dealmaker-in-chief just needs to get more than a hundred more of these done before the clock runs out on July 8 \u2013 when punishingreciprocal tariffs as high as 50%on dozens of nations are set to go back into effect.\nNo biggie. Or, at least that\u2019s what Trump says. In aTime interview last month, he said he had made 200 trade deals already, later clarifying that they\u2019ll be done soon.\nEven if that were somehow possible, these deals have been promised for months, and the slow-as-molasses pace of striking any kind of compromise on trade doesn\u2019t bode well for the ultimate prize: a d\u00e9tente with China. With tariffs of at least 145% on most Chinese imports, and a 125% retaliatory tariff by China on most US goods, trade has all but stopped with one of America\u2019s most important economic partners.\nUS and Chinese officials are set tomeet this weekend in Genevato negotiate the trade situation, though US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week it was unlikely that they\u2019d hammer out a deal \u2013 he\u2019s hoping for a \u201cde-escalation.\u201d Trump, however, on Wednesday said he would not lower the high tariffs on China in advance of discussions, which Beijing has previously said was a pre-condition for talks.\nIn the meantime, America\u2019s aggressive trade war has put its effective tariff rate on imports at more than 22%, according to Fitch Ratings, the highest by far of any developed country. That has sent the US economy into reverse. Last week\u2019sreport on gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed America\u2019s first contraction since early 2022, as an otherwise-healthy economy was dragged down by companies stockpiling goods to get ahead of tariffs.\nAnd that was the first quarter \u2013 before the most aggressive trade policy had taken effect.\nDespite the administration\u2019s rhetoric that it is in advanced trade negotiations with more than a dozen countries, actual trade deals take significant time \u2013 often years \u2013 to hash out. They typically involve incredibly complex agreements, delving into the minutiae of various goods and nontariff barriers. They often involve significant political considerations, as various parties seek to protect voters with special interests.\nInstead, the \u201cdeal\u201d the Trump administration inked with the UK Thursday is more like a memorandum of understanding. That may result in lower tariffs in the near term, but they\u2019ll do little that amounts to a substantial economic win for quite some time.\n\u201cThe 90-day tariff pause, which is now roughly 25% over, provides little time for the typical back-and-forth trade discussions that require months if not years to craft a trade deal,\u201d said Jacob Jensen, trade policy analyst for the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute.\n\u201cThere is a significant difference if these deals are official, written trade agreements rather than verbal commitments to buy more US products, as one has long-term economic implications and the other can be ignored down the line,\u201d he added.\nAnd so far this is just a single announced agreement. The reciprocal tariffs that went into effect April 7 and were paused for 90 days on April 9 affect dozens of countries. A hundred or so more are subject to the 10% universal tariff. The administration can\u2019t possibly get those all done by July 8.\nTrump said last week he would not extend the tariffs a second time \u2013 and, in fact, may act sooner to reinstate some tariffs with countries with whom his administration cannot reach an agreement, perhaps in a matter of a couple weeks.\n\u201cIt will be difficult for the US trade representative to negotiate potentially 100 separate trade agreements within 90 days, meaning President Trump must soon determine whether tariffs will be reinstated or delayed further,\u201d Jensen said.\nAnd even if deals are ultimately completed with all countries, there\u2019s no guarantee Trump would keep them. For example, Trump, in his first term, was instrumental in negotiating the USMCA free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, only to abandon it in his second term, charging an on-again, off-again 25% tariff on some Mexican and Canadian goods. And by placing significant tariffs on virtually all goods coming into the United States, Trump also blew up a number of existing trade deals with allies.\nThe stock market cheered Thursday. Now the hard work begins.\n\u201cThe market was desperately waiting for a deal to get done,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. \u201cThis was probably the easiest one to do.\u201d\nRegardless of how many trading partners the United States reaches deals or even \u201cdeals\u201d with, the one that really matters is China. A lot is riding on the success of US and Chinese officials\u2019 discussions in Geneva this weekend.\nThe historically high tariff on China has effectively stopped all trade between the two countries, Trump has said repeatedly. Sailings from China to the United Statesfell 60% in April, according to Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. JPMorgan estimates Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year.\nAs goods that were warehoused before tariffs took effect begin to run out over the next week or so, American consumers should expect pandemic-like disruptions, including higher prices, shortages and empty store shelves, port executives and supply chain experts tell CNN.\nBessent has said repeatedly that the high tariff on China is \u201cunsustainable,\u201d and Trump also said he expects the tariff to come down. But it would need to come down significantly \u2013 by more than half \u2013 for any real trade to recommence, trade experts say. Even then, the economic damage would be done \u2013 and it would be weeks or even months before American shelves would be replenished.\nDespite the increasingly dire warnings and economic turmoil, the countries seem not to be remotely close to a deal. Even with the talks set to kick off this weekend, Bessent said it could take two to three years for trade to normalize with China.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/08\/economy\/trade-deal","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"How Trump turned the tide in his trade war","date":"2025-07-23","body":"President Donald Trump has pulled off an impressive feat: He is raising tariffs on some of America\u2019s most important trading partners, and the world is largelycheering the agreementsas victories.\nPlacing historically high taxes on imports from around the world \u2014 particularly at a time when American consumers are still reeling from the highest inflation they\u2019ve experienced in four decades \u2014 marked one of Trump\u2019s boldest gambles of his presidency. Trump was largely elected on his pledge to fix Americans\u2019 finances. Economists have widely shunned his trade policy, which isexpected to raise costs for businesses and consumers.\nBut Trump zagged when everyone was zigging, and \u2014 so far \u2014 the bet has paid off. He achieved that with some old-fashioned psychology: setting the bar so high for potential tariff pain that anything that has come below that bar appears like a win.\nTrump \u201calways has a plan, but it\u2019s not always obvious,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg Television Wednesday morning.\nFor example, Trump had threatened Japan with a 25% tariff earlier this month when negotiations stalled. But late Tuesday, atrade agreement between the two nationswas announced, including a tariff rate of 15% on Japanese goods imported into the United States. US markets got a healthy bounce higher Wednesday. Japan\u2019s markets took off like a rocket.\nBut 15% is more than the 10% that US importers have been paying for Japanese exports since April, when Trump first rolled out hisso-called reciprocal tariffson trading partners \u2014 and much more than what the 1.5% tariff on Japanese goods before Trump took office.\nThe victory, some analysts say, is the certainty that the trade agreements provide investors, consumers and businesses.\n\u201cThe positive is that hopefully we\u2019re coming to the end of all the tariff cloudiness in terms of what the ultimate rates will be so businesses can plan around them,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of One Point BFG Wealth Partners, in a note to investors Wednesday morning. Boockvar, however, acknowledged this is \u201ca bizarre political and economic theory world we now live in.\u201d\nTrump is winning by moving the goal posts, noted Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James.\n\u201cCompared to what he threatened, it looks like he caved. Compared to what was previous, it\u2019s a significant tariff,\u201d Mills told CNN. \u201cInvestors just want to know a number. They almost don\u2019t care what it is, they just want the uncertainty to go away.\u201d\nOr as TD Securities Analyst Chris Krueger put it: Trump has shifted the Overton window \u2013 the range of outcomes that the public is willing to accept.\n\u201c(A) 15% tariff on the US\u2019s fifth-largest trading partner? Better than 25%,\u201d Kruger said in a note to investors.\nThe trade war is far from complete, and the long-term implications of Trump\u2019s decisions could yet be damaging \u2014 economically and politically. But, in the near term, Trump appears to be winning.\nThat tide began to turn on April 9, when Trump paused for 90 days his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announced a week earlier that had sent the stock market plunging and briefly entering bear market territory. The bond market had also begun to show signs that it might break \u2014 until Treasury Secretary Scott Bessentguided Trump awayfrom his harshest tariff levels.\nMarkets haverallied from that point on,and consumer sentiment \u2014 which sank near all-time lows \u2014 has rebounded.\nSeveral other events helped soothe fears since the tariff pause: On April 12, the Trump administration excluded smartphones and electronics from the historically high tariffs it had placed on China, leading to another market bounce-back. In mid-May, the Trump administration reached an agreement with China to lower tariffs dramatically and open some markets that both sides had closed off as tensions rose. Tariffs on Chinese imports fell to 35% from 145%, which had been a historic level that served as an effective shipping embargo.\nA trade agreement with the UK, a reinforced China agreement and a slew of announcements Tuesday on trade, fromIndonesia to the Philippinesand then Japan also provided much-needed doses of certainty.\nTrump has also used tariffs, deals and threats as a way to give US industry a boost. He has fought hard against so-called non-tariff barriers, including digital services taxes, which the administration believes put undue pressure on the American tech industry.\nFor example, late last month, Trump railed against Canada for imposing a tax on online companies and threatened to end trade talks. Trump also said he would set a new tariff for Canada by the end of this week. Days later,Canada backed downand dropped the tax.\nTrump worked to include opening US exports to foreign countries as part of his trade agreements, too,including beef to the United Kingdom, rice and cars to Japan, and various items to Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.\nHowever, it\u2019s not clear Trump can claim victory on trade just yet. At least dozens of trading partners are expected to get higher tariffs set at the end of next week, and Trump has floated raising the 10% universal tariff he imposed on April 2to 15% or 20%. The European Union, another major US trading partner, has found a trade agreement elusive, and tariffs could surge on both sides of the Atlantic as a result.\nThe US and global economies have largely been able to withstand Trump\u2019s tariffs over the past several months, but it\u2019s not clear that they can if those rates go higher \u2014 particularly as US importers work through warehoused inventories of goods that were brought in to the United States before tariffs were put in place.\n\u201cIt remains too early to fully understand the longer-term implications, especially with another round of new tariff developments expected in August,\u201d Lynn Song, ING\u2019s chief economist for Greater China, said in a note to clients Wednesday morning.\nThe Trump administration knows this. And the better-than-expected deal with Japan suggests the White House may be reluctant to push important trading partners too hard, recognizing that the economic pain from high tariffs and potential tit-for-tat retaliation could prove unacceptable to businesses, investors and the public, noted Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities for UBS Global Wealth Management.\nInflation is starting to creep higher. Business sentiment is improving, but earnings and growth expectations remain pretty stagnant. Consumer sentiment is on the upswing but still comparatively low to where it was before Trump started putting tariffs in place. The job market is showing some cracks.\nAs a result, the US dollar continues to sink sharply, in a sign of concern about potential US economic weakness to come. US and Japanese bonds sold off Wednesday, too.\nThat\u2019s the market\u2019s way of waying the certainty of the present could quickly turn into more tumult in the future.\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/23\/business\/trump-trade-deals","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"The first boats carrying Chinese goods with 145% tariffs are arriving in LA. Shipments are cut in half. Expect shortages soon","date":"2025-05-06","body":"American consumers are on the cusp of tough choices because of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war.\nShips now pulling into US harborsfrom China are the first to be subject to the massive tariffs that America is imposing on most Chinese imports. That means, in a matter of weeks, consumers will facehigher pricesand shortages of certain items.\nImports from China have fallen dramatically since Trump imposed steep tariffs \u2013 particularly since last month, when the tit-for-tat trade war sent the tariff on mostChinese goods up to 145%.\n\u201cThis week, we\u2019re down about 35% compared to the same time last year, and these cargo ships coming in are the first ones to be attached to the tariffs that were levied against China and other locations last month,\u201d Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, told CNN Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why the cargo volume is so light.\u201d\nThe drop-off in imports from China on the boats now coming into port is more than 50%, Seroka said. Many importers have canceled previous orders because US businesses aren\u2019t interested in paying the steep tariff, which can more than double the price of Chinese goods.\nThe Port of LA had expected 80 ships to arrive in May, but 20% of those have been canceled, Seroka said. Customers have already canceled 13 sailings for June.\n\u201cAnd you still don\u2019t know how long this is going to last,\u201d Seroka warned. \u201cRetailers and importers alike are telling me that the products now cost about two and a half times more than they did just last month.\u201d\nRather than import goods to the United States, some retailers are choosing to pay to store their products in Chinese warehouses because it\u2019s cheaper than paying the tariff, according to Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. With importers and retailers unwilling to pay the steep cost, deliveries could continue to fall \u2013 as much as 60%, said Petersen. Consumers will start to notice very soon.\n\u201dA 60% decline in containers means 60% less stuff arriving,\u201d Petersen told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before they sell through existing inventory, and then you\u2019ll see shortages. And that\u2019s when you see price hikes.\u201d\nImports into the United States during the second half of 2025 are expected to fall at least 20% year over year, according to the National Retail Federation. The decline from China will be even starker: JP Morgan expects a 75% to 80% drop in imports from there.\nIn the meantime, Americans are continuing to buy goods that were previously warehoused in the United States. But thosestockpilesare starting to run out.\n\u201cIf this goes on for a few more weeks, (retailers will) sell through that inventory and by the summertime, you\u2019ll have shortages and empty shelves,\u201d Petersen told CNN last week.\nSeroka doesn\u2019t expect completely empty shelves \u2013 but he predicts customers will have less selection.\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re looking for a certain type of pants, you may find all kinds of pants, but not the type you want. And the type you want\u2026.are going to be priced up,\u201d said Seroka.\nStockpiling boosted the US trade deficit more than expected in March, widening it to a record $140.5 billion as businesses hoarded materials, supplies and consumer goods ahead of the bulk of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\u201cBusinesses spent Q1 front-loading ordersfor consumer and capital goods (among other things) ahead of Liberation Day on April 2,\u201d noted Daniel Vielhaber, economist at Nationwide, in a note to clients Tuesday. \u201cHowever, with the new tariffs now in place, we look for a shift up in inflation, adding a headwind to already slowing consumer activity and economic growth.\u201d\nDespite the swell of new tariffs in April, economists anticipate the surge in imports to continue for at least a few more weeks as the last few shipments that were on the water before Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs were announced arrive into port.\n\u201cGoods will enter the country duty free if they were loaded on a ship at the port of departure or in route to the US ahead of the tariff imposition date and are received before May 27,\u201d Wells Fargo economists wrote in a note to investors Tuesday. \u201cThis gives businesses a bit more time to get product in ahead of tariffs and suggests we may see a last-ditch effort in the April data. But beyond that we expect trade to slow materially.\u201d\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the capacity of container ships coming from China. Goods shipped from China into the port of LA have been cut in half, but many of the boats themselves have been adequately stocked with containers from China and elsewhere.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/06\/business\/tariffs-price-increases-shortages-ports","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"White House\u2019s impatience for trade deals grows as economic anxiety builds","date":"2025-04-30","body":"On his 100th day in office,President Donald Trumpcrowed to arally of supportersabout a dawning \u201cgolden age\u201d for the American economy, made possible by his new tariffs.\nOn his 101st,he warned in a different settingthat children may have to shrink their toy chests as the tariffs raise the price of dolls from China.\nFor Trump, an uncertain economy and a long-term plan to restore US manufacturing come with a messaging challenge: how to explain to Americans who elected him on a promise to lower prices that, in fact, it is higher prices they should prepare for in the immediate future.\nTrump\u2019s solution so far has been to embrace the good and mostly blame the bad \u2014 including anegative gross domestic product reportWednesday \u2014 on his predecessor Joe Biden, whose name was uttered 51 times in Wednesday\u2019s Cabinet meeting.\nAnd as he did this week, Trump has shifted his message based on who\u2019s listening. His rally north of Detroit on Tuesday made little mention of \u201ctransition period\u201d pain that could result from the tariffs. A day later, however, he said frankly that Americans may need to adjust their consumption and spending habits.\n\u201cYou know, somebody said, \u2018Oh, the shelves, they\u2019re going to be open,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWell maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\u201d\nIt was the starkest example yet of Trump warning that disruptions could be coming as a consequence of his trade war. He has argued the end result is worth it.\nBehind the scenes, officials describe intense pressure to produce deals or announcements \u2014 and in particular, new trade agreements \u2014 that could provide long-awaited good news on the economy, sources familiar with the talks told CNN.\nWhile the president is not growing uneasy about his long-held belief in tariffs as a way to revive the American economy, advisers said he is increasingly growing impatient about the need for the US to reach a deal with some countries on trade in the coming days.\nTop officials, including the president himself along with top economic advisers like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have publicly described on television being close to striking new trade deals.\nCalling into a NewsNation town hall Wednesday night, Trump said the administration had \u201cpotential deals\u201d with Japan, South Korea and India, which follows administration officials repeatedly touting that they\u2019re close to finalizing a deal with New Delhi.\nOfficials representing Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been in Washington for intensive talks over the past weeks. They have come armed with a number of offers and concessions, eager to be the first country to strike a trade agreement that would result in an easing of the 26% reciprocal tariff Trump has threatened.\n\u201cThat messaging is strategic,\u201d one person close to the talks said, adding that the president\u2019s advisers acknowledge they are \u201cnot where they need to be\u201d when it comes to messaging on the economy.\nSome Republicans also hope swift work on trade agreements can help Trump regain some initiative on economic messaging. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, acknowledged Wednesday\u2019s GDP report was a worrying sign.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t look at this today and recognize it for anything other than being unacceptable,\u201d he said, saying he expected to start seeing impacts from tariffs \u201cat a retail level\u201d that will impact consumer prices \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reasons why I think President Trump\u2019s right to hold them accountable, but we\u2019re going to have, we\u2019re going to have headwinds and inflationary headwinds as well,\u201d he said.\nThe president\u2019s comments in the Cabinet Room were a rare acknowledgment that a lingering trade war with China could be felt directly by Americans. He used dolls as an example \u2013 seemingly to minimize the hardship or economic pain \u2013 even as myriad other goods that consumers and businesses rely upon are also likely to be missing from store shelves.\nThe prospect of a disruption in the supply chain is a critical source of anxiety for business executives, who have been conveying concerns to the White House for weeks about the fallout from the Trump tariffs and ensuing trade war.\nHowever, senior White House officials continue to insist they are optimistic that once deals with other countries are announced, the economic tide will begin to turn.\nThere has also been a direct emphasis in recent days on Trump\u2019s tax plan, including making his 2017 tax cuts permanent. Bessent told reporters this week he wants a tax package to be finalized by early July. It is widely believed within Trump\u2019s orbit that more movement on the president\u2019s tax plan will provide a needed boost to the economic climate, the sources said.\n\u201cWe continue to view this as a mid- to long-term plan,\u201d one of the senior White House officials told CNN about their economic strategy, adding that breaking the global economic order to create \u201cmore fair\u201d trade practices for the US was \u201cnever going to happen overnight.\u201d\nDespite that line of messaging, quiet anxiety over the economy\u2019s current state is building, with many of the people involved in crafting Trump\u2019s plan aware they need to make substantial progress quickly to give the public more reason to, as Trump himself put it on Wednesday, \u201cbe patient.\u201d\nWhile the first 100 days of his second term are now behind him, Trump is sending the message that he needs more time for his economic policies to take hold \u2014 a period of transition to implement his tariffs, his tax agenda and more.\nHe repeatedly declined to say in Wednesday evening\u2019s NewsNation town hall how long that period would last. And he acknowledged there\u2019s a risk to his tariff strategy, conceding that he still needs to sell it to the American people.\nYet that uncertainty was not something Trump mentioned on the campaign trail, when he pledged to offer an economic lifeline to Americans.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to bring prices down,\u201d Trump said in the days leading up to the election. \u201cWe can rescue our economy from total obliteration and restore our country to full prosperity explosive growth and maximum strength.\u201d\nNow, like then, Trump\u2019s penchant to blame Biden comes naturally. He\u2019s a forever foil that Trump\u2019s advisers are also quick to reference in hopes of pleasing the president.\n\u201cThis is Biden\u2019s economy,\u201d Trump told a gathering of CEOs at the White House on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cI think you have to give us a little bit of time to get moving, but this is still the Biden economy.\u201d\nEven some of Trump\u2019s supporters aren\u2019t buying that explanation.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that old expression? Don\u2019t piss down my back and tell me it\u2019s raining? Well that applies here,\u201d wrote Dave Portnoy, a Trump supporter and founder of Barstool Sports, on X. \u201cThe stock market is a direct reflection of Trumps 1st 100 days in office. Doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t get better and that we don\u2019t need to be patient, but this is his market not Bidens.\u201d\nStill, one Cabinet member after another on Wednesday sought to blame Biden, a message that seemed to sit well with Trump, who sat at the center of the table and often smiled as he listened.\n\u201cThe Biden administration put us in a real predicament right now, the whole trade team, the whole Cabinet,\u201d Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said.\n\u201cWe had a meltdown under Biden,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.\nThis story has been updated with additional comments from Trump.\nCNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/30\/politics\/white-house-economic-anxiety-trade-deals","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

They may never use it","date":"2025-05-06","body":"One of America\u2019s closest allies recently raised eyebrows for threatening to fire off the ultimate financial weapon against Washington in trade talks: dumping US debt.\nJapanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato, whose country is the biggest holder of US Treasuries, said on Friday that selling the assets is a \u201ccard on the table\u201d in tariff negotiations, according toThe Associated Press.\n\u201cIt does exist as a card, but I think whether we choose to use it or not would be a separate decision,\u201d Kato said.\nRelated articleThe clock is ticking down to zero, and Trump needs a trade deal \u2014 badly\nTwo days later, the Japanese officialwalked back the comment, stressing on Sunday that the longtime US ally is \u201cnot considering the sale of US Treasuries as a means of Japan-US negotiations.\u201d\nJapan was unlikely to fire this big bazooka in the trade war anyway, since selling US Treasuries is considered an extreme move \u2014 one that would likely backfire, experts say. Still, the short-lived threat raises an ugly truth: The United States relies on other countries buying its$36 trillion mountain of debt.\nIt\u2019s another way that President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive trade war could hurt the American economy: Tariffs have the potential to reduce the amount of capital seeking a home in American assets, which could lift interest rates and hurt the value of the US dollar. Even if a large-scale Treasury selloff is unlikely, other nations \u2014 including one of America\u2019s closest allies \u2014 are clearly considering all options.\nAs America\u2019sbiggestforeign creditor, Japan sits on $1.1 trillion of US Treasuries. That gives Tokyo some leverage as it seeks tohammer out a trade dealwith the White House.\nIf Japan sold massive amounts of US debt, it would very likely spark a massive Treasury selloff. Treasury rates would in turn sharply increase, making it more expensive for Washington to borrow and freaking out investors along the way.\n\u201cIt would send shockwaves around world financial markets if one of the most reliable buyers of Treasuries is no longer reliably in the market for it,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale and a chief economist in the Biden administration.\nRecall thatfears of a bond market catastrophehelped convince Trump to pause so-called \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on April 9.\nAnd Washington doesn\u2019t just rely on Japan to buy its debt.\nChina has been slapped with tariffs of at least 145% on most goods, but it is also America\u2019s second-biggest foreign creditor, with $784 billion of Treasuries as of February,according to federal data.\nThe United Kingdom, which faces a 10% tariff, is America\u2019s third-largest foreign creditor, with $750 billion of US Treasuries. And the sixth-biggest holder of US Treasuries, Canada, is being threatened with more tariffs if it does not join the United Statesas the 51st state.\nBut for these nations, dumping US debt, especially in a fire sale, would risk destabilizing global markets as well as their own.\nRelated articleAmerica\u2019s debt problem is storing up trouble for the rest of the world\nMoreover, it would hurt their own investments and that of their banks and citizens. Their own currencies could also sharply increase in value, making it harder to sell their goods overseas.\n\u201cThreatening to dump an asset of which it is a major holder means that Japan can hurt itself in the process,\u201d Win Thin, global head of market strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. He wrote that this kind of threat is \u201calways a double-edged sword.\u201d\nMaury Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN that Japan\u2019s comments seem \u201cvery rash\u201d and amount to \u201cjust a silly response.\u201d\n\u201cNo one wants to sell a lot of Treasuries quickly because they would take losses on their entire portfolio, and Japan\u2019s is vast,\u201d Obstfeld said. \u201cThis would also invite massive tariff retaliation.\u201d\nMoreover, as Obstfeld notes, Japan needs Washington to defend itself in the volatile Asia-Pacific region. It wouldn\u2019t want to do anything to cast doubt on that support from the American military.\n\u201cThe fact is that US Treasuries are so central to world financial markets that it\u2019s really hard to damage the United States \u2013 without hurting yourself in the process,\u201d said Yale\u2019s Tedeschi.\nStill, the warning from Japan does speak to a broader issue.\n\u201cBoth theory and data show that trade tariffs reduce net capital inflows,\u201d said Kent Smetters, professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.\nSmetters, who runs the Penn Wharton Budget Model, noted that capital was indeed leaving the United States and rates were rising before Trump announced his pause on reciprocal tariffs.\n\u201cIf the tariffs are fully implemented, the US will need to sell its future debt\u2026 at lower prices and higher yields,\u201d Smetters said. \u201cMore tax cuts, instead of helping offset some of the negative effects of tariffs, will add to the debt at a time when it will become more costly to do so.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/06\/economy\/trade-war-tariffs-japan-china-us-debt","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

His U-turn pushed stocks higher\nTrumphas saidhe\u2019d seek a \u201cfair deal\u201d with China and that tariffs could come down \u201csubstantially\u201d from the 145% level to which he ratcheted them up in an escalatory tit-for-tat \u2013 the same day Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the two countries would need to de-escalate tensions before they could talk directly.\nThe nod to a softening-but-still-hawkish stance toward China spurred a stock market rally Wednesday, even as official communications between the superpowers remain quiet. Even cutting tariffs in half would represent a position that would severely limit trade flows.\nAnd while Trump says that discussions are \u201cactive\u201d with Beijing, two senior Chinese officials are not planning to meet with any Trump aides while in Washington Wednesday and Thursday for meetings on the global economy, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\u201cStill a staring contest for now,\u201d said one US official familiar with the lack of trade talk between the two sides.\nBessent said Wednesday that more than 100 nations have approached the administration to try to broker deals during a 90-day pause on most retaliatory tariffs. Many leaders phoned Trump immediately after the pause, and some countries sent delegations in person to Washington.\nBut that initial rush has now slowed to a trickle.\nTrump\u2019s propensity to back-track or change course on trade has created an environment of acute uncertainty that, even as his team tries to broker deals, has some nations taking a wait-and-see approach.\nThis week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the US had received 18 written proposals for new trade terms since the pause began \u2013 a slight increase from the 15 proposals Kevin Hassett, Trump\u2019s chief economic policy maker, said had been received on April 10.\nTreasury, which is leading the negotiations for the individualized deals, has not released readouts for the majority of discussions Secretary Bessent has held to try advance them.\nSources briefed on the progress say that the Trump administration is nearing memoranda of understanding with a handful of countries, including the United Kingdom, Japan and India, that would outline in loose terms more detailed negotiations that would follow.\nRelated articleTrump is waiting for Xi to call. The Chinese see it differently\nOne of the delays, these sources said, is that the White House would prefer to announce the nascent deals as a group, rather than in one-off announcements. But amid a steep stock market selloff on April 21 over the lack of progress on such deals, the Office of the US Trade Representative released a statement saying the US and India had agreed on terms to \u201clay down a roadmap\u201d for future trade talks.\nThe White House says the administration is working toward a slate of deals that will be sufficient to Trump.\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s trade and economic team is working at breakneck speed to negotiate custom-tailored deals with our major trading partners,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai told CNN in a statement. \u201cAny final decisions and agreements, however, will come from President Trump and President Trump only.\u201d\nWhether Trump would find such pledges for future negotiations as ample progress to further pause tariffs remains to be seen. During his first term, Trump in the Oval Office railed against so-called MOUs, which he said \u201cdon\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go into a memorandum, I would go right into a trade agreement,\u201d he said in February 2019. \u201cEither you\u2019re gonna make a deal or you\u2019re not.\u201d\nLegal challenges to Trump\u2019s tariffs have emerged from a range of parties, from small businesses to the Blackfeet Tribe in Montana, to the State of California. The fate of several cases, which argue Trump overstepped his legal authority to levy these tariffs on the grounds of a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d has compounded the uncertainty for companies navigating them and countries trying to negotiate around them.\nAt the Court of International Trade, five small businesses that import goods from impacted countries sued the administration, arguing that Trump overstepped his authority in imposing the tariffs on the grounds of a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d The court will hear arguments in Washington, DC, on May 6 and has ruled that the tariffs can remain in place as the case proceeds.\nThe Trump administration also faces lawsuits filed in Montana by members of the Blackfeet Tribe, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, an Illinois-based toy maker, and a paper goods company in Florida. Given the distinct possibility that the tariffs could be overturned \u2013 or temporarily enjoined \u2013 by a judge, many trading partners have approached the negotiations with the Trump administration in a cautious manner, unwilling to barter on specific terms.\nThe challenge for the administration, according to a source familiar with progress, is that some hesitant nations have been noncommittal or delayed in their approach.\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m willing to maybe think about or talk about that at some future date,\u2019\u201d the source told CNN, requesting anonymity to describe private discussions.\nThe challenge for those nations, however, is that other trading partners could find themselves at the front of the queue if they provide more tangible details.\n\u201cNegotiations can move slowly or move quickly,\u201d the source said. \u201cIf you want to move quickly, you have to come with pen and paper.\u201d\nAs for when the deals could be reached, multiple sources familiar with the process who spoke to CNN acknowledged that the detailed nature of trade deals requires time. The best case by the 90-day deadline, they said, is that progress has been made with allied nations, not that a dotted line has been signed.\nOne critical problem for Trump\u2019s economic and trade team: Beneath the high-level bilateral talks, departments lack the senior political appointees to assemble the fine print of such deals.\nNo individuals have been nominated to serve in the number-two roles at the USTR and the Department of Commerce. Commerce also lacks a nominee for undersecretary for economic affairs and undersecretary for international affairs. At Treasury, no nominee has been put forth for undersecretary for International Affairs. The State Department\u2019s nominee for undersecretary of economic growth, Jacob Helberg, has not received a Senate hearing.\nTrump\u2019s decision to move forward with a trade agenda even more aggressive than what he campaigned on \u2013 with such glaring gaps in agency mastheads \u2013  has raised eyebrows, especially as pro-tariff trade hawks wield outsized influence.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/23\/politics\/trump-trade-deals-haphazard-strategy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nBy now, anyone with even half an eye on the news has seen headlines about how the economy is suddenly in trouble because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs: Markets are swinging wildly, investors are panic-buying gold, bond yields are surging, and the dollar is falling.\nIt\u2019s not great. But as you glance up from your phone and look around, maybe nothingfeelsall that different? You may still have a job. There\u2019s still plenty of produce at the grocery store. Your morning coffee and bagel cost the same as they did a month ago. Maybe the media are blowing everything out of proportion?\nWhile I\u2019ll admit we reporters live for a good drama, that\u2019s not exactly what\u2019s going on here.\nWhen you think of the trade war, think of a summer storm rolling in. There\u2019s a flash of lightning.One. Two. Three. Four.Then a crash of thunder.\nRight now, most consumers are in that quiet pause in the middle. The crash is coming.\nThere are effectively two shocks hitting the economy right now: Trump\u2019s tariffs on foreign goods and the paralysis caused by Trump\u2019s messaging about those tariffs.\nThe latter is proving the most broadly disruptive so far, as we saw in the Fed\u2019s Beige Book report Wednesday. The theme of the latest Fed survey of businesses: Uncertainty. The word was mentioned 81 times, the mostever,and up from 47 in March.\nBut the tariffs themselves, especially the 145% tax on Chinese imports, have had an almost immediate impact, especially on American small businesses.\nRelated article\u2018Chaotic\u2019 tariff regime and trade war are leaving small businesses in their wake\nTake Busy Baby, a small business based in Minnesota, which specializes in products that tether baby toys and utensils to keep them off the floor. (Side note: I want one for every distraught parent I\u2019ve seen picking their kid\u2019s pacifier off the NYC sidewalk.)\nSales have been booming, my colleagueAlicia Wallace reports.The veteran-owned company got its foot in the door at Walmart and Target, and it recently placed its largest-ever order from its manufacturer in China.\nBut as of last week, that $158,000 order, which is already paid for, was sitting in a warehouse 7,500 miles away. If it were to get shipped to the US, Busy Baby would be on the hook for an additional $229,100 to cover the 145% tariff. (The founder, Beth Fynbo Benike, launched a crowdfunding campaign to try to cover the cost.)\n\u201cI\u2019m at risk of going out of business completely,\u201d she told Alicia.\nDilemmas like this are playing out across the United States. Many small business owners \u2014 which employ nearly half of the US workforce \u2014 told Alicia that US-based manufacturing simply doesn\u2019t exist for a lot of products, and hasn\u2019t for decades.\nIf the tariffs hold, business owners\u2019 options become limited: eat the added costs, try to pass the costs onto customers, or fold.\nFor the rest of us, the pain will come in the form of higher prices and fewer options. After years of waiting for pandemic-era inflation to ease, prices are set to surge again. In the fall, the International Monetary Fund predicted US inflation would clock in at 2% in 2025. Now, under Trump\u2019s tariffs, the group expects inflation to hit 3%.\nEconomic shocks don\u2019t hit everyone equally, or all at once. Right now, the folks closest to the lightning strike are the people running businesses. Like Busy Baby, they\u2019re doing everything they can to keep the lights on.\nAfter all, it\u2019s only been three weeks since Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff speech, and many importers bulked up their inventories in advance to try to get ahead of the tariffs.\nThat front-running is winding down, according to Brendan Duke, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who notes that the number of vessels coming into the Port of Los Angeles this week are up 57% from a year ago.\nRelated articleThe economic damage from Trump\u2019s tariffs is piling up\nNext week, that number is projected to normalize, falling just 8% year-over-year. But the crash is just around the corner.\n\u201cTwo weeks from now we\u2019re in The Bad Place,\u201d he wroteon Bluesky, noting incoming shipments were set to fall 44% from the same week last year.\nBut even the \u201cbad place\u201d scenario won\u2019t affect you overnight, Duke said in an interview Thursday.\nThat\u2019s because it takes three to four weeks for a container ship to go from Asia to southern California, Duke said, and most of the ships arriving at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach this week left when US businesses were still in stockpiling mode \u2014 before super-size tariffs on China were announced on April 9.\nIt could be several more weeks or months before customers start seeing less variety on store shelves, because retailers will draw from their stockpile before resuming imports.\nTrump has signaled he might take some of the heat off China, but the White House has said the 10% universal tariffs now in place aren\u2019t up for negotiation.\nThose tariffs alone are still painful for American businesses and consumers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still going to increase overall prices by 3%. It\u2019s still going to lead to an economic slowdown,\u201d Duke said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re averting the worst scenario, but the baseline scenario is pretty horrible, too.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/25\/business\/trump-tariff-pain-customers-nightcap","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The global trade war will badly hurt the US and global economies, WTO says","date":"2025-04-16","body":"President Donald Trump\u2019s globaltrade warwill hurt economies around the world this year, including the US, according to a new report by the World Trade Organization.\nThe WTO projects global economies will grow more slowly than they would without tariffs \u2014 and that will be especially the case in North America, a region dominated by the United States, which will see a greater slowdown than other areas.\nA battery of new tariffs imposed by Trump and retaliated against by other nations mean global trade prospects have \u201cdeteriorated sharply,\u201d the WTO report read. Total global trade will now shrink 0.2%, the organization expects, compared to a 2.7% growth forecast without tariffs.\nThe global economy and, by extension, people\u2019s pocketbooks are very much connected to the trade in goods and services between countries. A shrinking economy typically means fewer (and lower-paid) jobs, financial difficulties for ordinary people and hard decisions about spending by companies and governments.\nThe WTO said it expects global economic output to grow by 2.2% this year. That increase would be 0.6 percentage points lower than the rate the WTO would expect in a scenario with no additional tariffs.\nIn North America economic output is expected to be 1.6 percentage points below what it would be otherwise.\nRelated articleChina posts unexpectedly strong economic growth before tariffs bite\nFitch Ratings was similarly gloomy on Wednesday, saying it had \u201csharply lowered its forecasts for world growth in response to the severe escalation in the global trade war.\u201d\nThe credit agencysaidit had cut its expectation for global economic growth in 2025 by 0.4 percentage points, and for the US by 0.5 percentage points, from its previous estimate in March.\nKristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund,wrote last yearthat more than a billion people rose from extreme poverty over the past 40 years, as global trade surged.\nIf Trump goes ahead and unleashes his so-called \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on the US\u2019 trading partners following the90-day pauseon those levies he announced last week, that \u2014 combined with general uncertainty about trade policy \u2014 will see the volume of traded goods contract by a much sharper 1.5% worldwide this year, the WTO predicted.\nTrump has, however, excluded one nation from that pause. China is now subject to a 125% reciprocal tariff on its goods exported to America, adding to the 20% across-the-board tariff that Trump recently imposed on its products.\nOne consequence, according to the WTO, is that China may redirect products destined for the US to other countries. It expects Chinese goods exports to rise by between 4% and 9% across all regions outside North America this year, which could increase competition in those markets.\nUncertainties around global trade tend to weigh on the global economy, the WTO argued in its report.\n\u201cWhen uncertainty around future tariffs or trade relations increases, firms may delay or scale back investments. This, in turn, reduces trade flows\u2026 and ultimately (helps lower) economic growth.\u201d\nLuciana Lopez contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/16\/business\/tariffs-wto-global-trade-economy-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Retail sales surged in March as Americans rushed to beat Trump\u2019s tariffs","date":"2025-04-16","body":"Spending at US retailers skyrocketed last month at the strongest monthly pace in more than two years as Americans rushed to beat President Donald Trump\u2019s massive tariff hikes.\nRetail sales climbed 1.4% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, up from February\u2019s 0.2% gain and the highest monthly gain since January 2023. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation.\nThe strong showing in March was largely driven by sales of cars and auto parts. Excluding those purchases, retail sales were up a more modest 0.5%.\nRelated articleEvery car is about to get more expensive. \u2018It\u2019s just math,\u2019 former Ford CEO says\nTrump\u2019s erratic trade war hasunsettled Americans in recent months, stoking fears of inflation picking up in the year ahead, according to various sentiment surveys. That expectation is now clearly having an effect on people\u2019s purchasing behavior.\nAmericans\u2019 spending frenzy could stretch into April, but will eventually fade, economists say. These brief buying sprints make it difficult for Wall Street and the Federal Reserve to understand the true strength of consumer spending, which powers about 70% of the US economy.\n\u201cIn the near term, we could have some really strong consumer spending numbers, but that just makes things a little bit tricky for the Fed,\u201d James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, told CNN. \u201cThat means that the Fed just sits and waits to see what happens,\u201d referring to the central bank\u2019s upcoming interest rate decisions.\nRetail sales in March were up across most categories, especially for car dealerships and home improvement stores.\nSpending on motor vehicles and parts was up a whopping 5.3% in March from February, the strongest monthly pace since January 2023. Meanwhile, sales at home improvement stores rose 3.3% during the same period.\nRetail sales declined at furniture shops (-0.7%), department stores (-0.3) and gas stations (-2.5). Since the Commerce Department\u2019s figures aren\u2019t adjusted for inflation, the March decline in sales at gas stations could reflect falling gas prices.\n\u201cConsumers are expecting sharply higher prices the next year and are clearing the store shelves and picking up bargains while they can,\u201d Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, said in commentary issued Wednesday.\nAmericans continued to eat out at restaurants and bars in March, with sales rising a robust 1.8% in March from the prior month. From a year earlier, those sales were up 4.8%.\n\u201cThe increase in bar and restaurant sales shows that consumers were more likely to spend on this discretionary experience,\u201d Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, wrote in an analyst note Wednesday.\n\u201cWe had been seeing waning momentum in this sector as the post-pandemic sugar high wore off and household budgets became constrained by higher prices and higher interest rates, but perhaps things aren\u2019t as dour as the consumer sentiment figures would lead you to believe,\u201d he added.\nWhile retail spending was up sharply in March, Americans\u2019 attitudes toward the economy have beendown in the dumpsdue to the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s whipsawing trade policy, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s latest consumer sentiment survey, among other surveys. Fed officials have taken notice of America\u2019s souring economic mood, but the central bank is specifically tasked by Congress to help drive employment and stable prices. And it is unclear how souring consumer sentiment will translate into spending, and then eventually into both hiring and prices.\nBut Trump\u2019s tariff are widely expected to cause both inflation and unemployment to ratchet higher, putting the economy on a path toward \u201cstagflation\u201d \u2014 a scenario of stagnant or negative growth and rising unemployment coupled with accelerating prices.\ufeff\nRelated articleTrump is trying to reinvent 1950 with his tariffs. He should be planning for 2050\n\u201cA tariff is like a negative supply shock. That\u2019s a stagflationary shock, which is to say it makes both sides of the Fed\u2019s dual mandate worse at the same time,\u201d Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said last week at an event in New York. \u201cPrices are going up while jobs are being lost and growth is coming down, and there is not a generic playbook for how the central bank should respond to a stagflationary shock.\u201d\nSo far, Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel; 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada that aren\u2019t compliant with a free-trade agreement among the countries; a massive 145% duty on Chinese imports; a 25% tariff on cars, with separate tariffs on auto parts coming at a later date; and a 10% baseline tariffs on all US imports.\nA massive tariff hike on dozens of countries briefly went into effect on April 9, though Trump swiftly delayed the tariff hike that same day until July. He also introduced temporary exemptions for some electronic goods, and he has said separate tariffs are likely coming down the pike on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper and timber.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/16\/business\/retail-sales-march-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Every day since has been a stream of contradictory statements and brinkmanship with no way of knowing which declarations will stick. (Not helping: The loomingthreat of a constitutional crisisas the White House picks fights with American courts, higher education, the entire legal profession and most of the media.)\nIt\u2019s no wonder then that the rest of the world is taking a look at the United States \u2014 as a trading partner, a travel destination, a steward of the global financial market \u2014 and shaking their heads.\nEven before the tariffs were announced, multiple European countries, Canada and China issued travel updates warning their citizens about potentially being detained at the US border. Canadians have beenespecially vocalabout canceling their trips to the US in protest of Trump\u2019s policies, including tariffs. But they\u2019re not alone: All foreign arrivals into major US airports tumbled 20% late last month compared with the same period a year ago, according toan Axios analysis\u2014 a fact that should alarm themore than $2 trillionUS travel and tourism industry.\nThe world\u2019s appetite for American-made stuff is also taking a hit, especially in China, which is retaliating against Washington\u2019s 145% tariff.\nOn Tuesday, Bloomberg reported thatBeijing has halted all deliveriesof aircraft and parts made by Boeing, that quintessentially American manufacturer that directly or indirectly supports 1.6 million US jobs.\nWhether Beijing\u2019s move is a negotiating tactic or a lasting boycott of the plane maker, it is decidedly bad news for Boeing, which hasn\u2019t turned a profit in more than five years. But it\u2019s great news for Boeing\u2019s European rival, Airbus.\nIt\u2019s not just planes. The tariffs are hitting China at a moment when US brands like Apple, Nike, Tesla and Starbucks are losing market share to homemade rivals,as the Wall Street Journal reports.\nThat consumer rejection is an especially thorny issue for businesses.\n\u201cYou see a lot of danger for US brands and US manufacturers in the current environment, both directly from retaliation by other governments, and indirectly from a very negative consumer response to American products in general,\u201d John Gilbert, an economics professor at Utah State University, told me. \u201cPeople have memories \u2014 I\u2019m not sure how much that dissipates, even if the governments of those countries can come up with some kind of agreement.\u201d\nAnd of course, there\u2019s theturmoil in the US Treasury market\u2014 the clearest, and frankly scariest, rebuke of Trump\u2019s tariff policies to date.\nICYMI:When stocks fell in response to tariffs, the market for US government bonds \u2014 the boring-est, safest, most vanilla of assets \u2014 should have been the go-to place for investors. That didn\u2019t happen.\nSleepy Treasuries started behaving like risk assets, a sign that investors are losing confidence in America\u2019s ability to pay its debt and manage its economy. That\u2019s the financial equivalent of a five-alarm fire.\nMeanwhile, the value of the US dollar has been falling \u2014 another sign investors are shying away from what has historically been the market\u2019s safe haven.\n\u201cI think this is one of the biggest \u2018own goals\u2019 to US credibility in financial markets that I\u2019ve ever seen in my lifetime,\u201d said Heidi Crebo-Rediker, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, in an interview. \u201cYou can look at the global financial crisis as being a hit to US credibility in terms of financial markets, but this is different\u2026 Covid was an external shock.

{"title":"Here\u2019s what\u2019s about to become more expensive with the next round of tariffs","date":"2025-04-15","body":"President Donald Trump is forging ahead with his aggressive tariff campaign, moving on from\u201creciprocal\u201dtariffs to the sector-specific tariffs he promised.\nTo do so will involve Trump\u2019scontinued application of Section 232of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows a president to impose tariffs to protect or bolster domestic industries if there are deemed potential national security threats. What used to be ararely employed trade provisionhas been a favorite instrument in Trump\u2019s trade tool box during his two terms.\nThe Commerce Department previously launched Section 232 probes into copper and lumber. And earlier this month, the administrationstarted investigating pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, according to Federal Register filings made public on Monday.\nIn addition to those active investigations, which have to be completed within 270 days after they began, the Trump administration has indicated plans to launch similar probes forcritical minerals.\n\u201cThe risk from (imposing duties) on imports of products where there are few substitutes is certainly greater, and that\u2019s why there have been some exemptions and reductions in tariffs and exclusions of products that are of key importance to the US,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN in an interview.\nThere have been notable exclusions from the slew of tariffs imposed by Trump, including goodscompliant under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement; the products undergoing or in the pipeline for Section 232 probes; and, just within the past few days, the exclusion ofsmartphones, computer monitors and other electronicsfrom the 145% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff on Chinese imports.\nThe tech products exemption is intended to betemporary, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Sunday, indicating that they\u2019ll be wrapped into the forthcoming semiconductor tariffs.\nAlthough the Trump administration has softened some of its tariff plans, the US economy is still expected to slow and be put on a \u201crecession watch,\u201d Daco said. His firm estimates that the increased cost of imports will lead tohigher prices,accelerated inflationand reduced economic activity both in the US and abroad.\n\u201cWhen you think about your trade policy, you want to be very careful not to exercise an extreme degree of pressure via higher prices on these sectors, and that\u2019s why so far there have been the exemptions and exclusions that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Daco added. \u201cIt\u2019s because there\u2019s a gradual realization that imposing a tax on imports of those critical products eventually hurts US businesses and hurts US consumers and therefore leads to lower economic activity.\u201d\nStill, there are added risks from the haphazard nature by which they\u2019ve been announced and applied, Daco added:Depressed consumerand business confidence leads to hesitation on spending and investment, while theheightened volatilityof financial markets and depressed stocks result in negative earnings and wealth.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what will be announced tomorrow, or what will be the trade policy landscape in a few weeks time, a few months time,\u201d Daco said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s very difficult to calibrate any type of forecast with any sense of precision.\u201d\nAlongside those near- and longer-term headwinds, tariffs could have unique impacts on each sector being evaluated under Section 232:\nRelated articleChina has a powerful card to play in its fight against Trump\u2019s trade war: rare earths\nCopper and critical minerals:It\u2019s not yet knownwhich mineralsthe US could consider investigating under Section 232; however, an investigation is already underway on copper \u2014 a critical cog in the ongoing electrification of America and industries such as defense.\nThe US imports about 50% of the copper it uses, and demand is only expected to grow, especially as energy-consuming industries such as artificial intelligence and blockchain boom, Dan Ikenson, economist and trade policy scholar at Ikenomics Consulting, told CNN.\n\u201cIt takes 16, 17, 18 years to get the licenses for mines and permits for refining,\u201d he said. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have those resources, and we\u2019re dependent on the world for it, we should not be agitating and looking to pick trade fights, we should be working out arrangements where we can have long-term access to Canada\u2019s exports, Chile\u2019s and Peru\u2019s.\u201d\nLumber:Softwood lumber is a critical and preferred ingredient for homebuilding, and 30% of it is imported by the US. Homebuilders warn that tariffs on softwood lumber and other materials couldfurther exacerbate the housing affordability crisis.\nHigher costs of lumber imports could also affect other products, such as furniture and even toilet paper.\nThe Trump administration, to bolster the US lumber industry, recently ordered that half of America\u2019s national forests be opened up for logging \u2014 a move criticized for its potential negative effects on the environment, species, watersheds and recreation.\nTrump has frequently quipped that theUS doesn\u2019t needto import items like lumber, cars and oil, claiming that natural resources and manufacturing potential are plentiful enough domestically for America to be self-sufficient.\nEconomists, researchers and other experts have frequently warned that it\u2019s not that simple: It takes years for manufacturing facilities to be built, supply chains to be established, and skilled workforces to be trained. (Plus, the construction of those new facilities would likely require imported materials that now are coming at a premium.)\nPharmaceuticals:Tariffs herepresent conflicting policy goals for Trump, who has stated he wants to bring down the prices of pharmaceutical products and bolster US manufacturing, Diederik Stadig, health care sector economist for ING,wrote in a postlast week.\n\u201cWhile some branded production might gradually be shifted to the US, a big increase in generic production is unlikely,\u201d he said, noting that the construction of new facilities takes roughly 10 years.\nTariffs also have an inflationary effect, which would drive up health care costs and hamper the affordability of medication, especially for people without insurance: Under a 25% tariff, commonly prescribed drugs could increase from 82 cents per pill to 94 cents a pill, or roughly $42 more per year, he wrote. More complex prescriptions, such as those for cancer treatment, could jump even higher, he wrote, estimating that a 24-week prescription could see additionalcosts in the $8,000 to $10,000 range.\nTariffs also have the potential to impact the availability of pharmaceutical products, Johnson & Johnson CEO Joaquin Duato said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday.\n\u201cTariffs can create disruptions in the supply chain, leading to shortages,\u201d Duato said. \u201cIf what you want is to build manufacturing capacity in the US, both in medtech and in pharmaceuticals, the most effective answer is not tariffs but tax policy.\u201d\nTo mitigate any potential impacts, Duato noted that he believes it\u2019s important for health care firms such as his to work with the government to ensure there\u2019s enough manufacturing capacity in the US.\nSemiconductors:Medical devices, Wi-Fi routers, laptops, smartphones, cars, household appliances and LED lightbulbs arejust a few examplesof where semiconductor chips are found. And these products often don\u2019t just require one or two. For instance, new cars contain thousands of them.\nPut another way, semiconductor chips are\u201cthe crude oil of the 21st century.\u201dAnd it has become glaringly obvious what happens when that oil runs dry: As a side effect of the pandemic, a chip shortage put cars and other products in short supply and fanned the flames of inflation.\nAlthough the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act passed during the Biden administrationhelped incentivize chipmakers like TSMCto open US facilities, even if tariffs do spur more domestic chip production, America still lacks electronic assembly capabilities, John Dallesasse, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, previously told CNN.\nBecause of that, any chips produced in the US would still have to be shipped abroad to places like Taiwan, South Korea, China or Mexico to be put into the finished electronics Americans buy, and those would be subject to tariffs.\nCNN\u2019s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/15\/economy\/next-round-of-tariffs-cost","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump says free trade killed American auto jobs. That\u2019s not the whole story","date":"2025-04-14","body":"Much of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff rhetoric has been about restoring factory jobs \u2014 particularly auto jobs \u2014 that he says had been destroyed by bad trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\u201cAmerican steelworkers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen \u2026 they really suffered gravely,\u201d Trump said during his April 2 rollout of new tariffs. \u201cForeign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream.\u201d\nTrump promises that his 25% tariffs on all imported cars will raise costs enough to bring a flood of new auto plant construction, and thus auto jobs, back to US shores. But the loss of auto jobs in the US, especially across the upper Midwest, is a complex story beyond trade deals and shifting production to low-wage countries. There was also the fact that American car buyers abandoned the three Detroit automakers for foreign competitors following years of questionable quality and value. And most importantly, the introduction of automation, which drastically reduced the hours needed to assemble a car.\n\u201cWhat you see is that the real story in the auto sector is automation,\u201d said Jason Miller, a business professor at Michigan State University and an auto industry expert.\nOne of the reasons the production shift to Mexico gets so much attention from those angry about assembly plants and auto parts factories closing, Miller says, is due totiming. The introduction of more robots, and the resulting job loss, \u201cwas especially severe during the exact time period that trade liberalization took place.\u201d\nAnd the situation is not nearly as dire as Trump makes it out to be. In fact, there are more workers building cars in US assembly plants today than when NAFTA took effectin 1994,according to the US Labor Department data. They also built roughly twice as many cars as Mexico and Canada combined last year, according to S&P Global Mobility.\nExperts widely agree that the trade deals are a distant third cause of autofactory closings, behind automation and market share losses.\nTariffs are not going to reverse those factors.\nAutomation revolutionized car manufacturing. It cut the time it took to build a car from about 50 hours of labor in 1988 down to about 18-20 hours by 2005, said Laurie Harbour, partner at auto industry consultant Wipfli, which studies auto plant efficiency.\n\u201cAt the same time, (the Detroit automakers) were dramatically losing market share,\u201d Harbour said. \u201cSo those two things combined \u2013 I\u2019m not making as many vehicles, and I\u2019m making them in like half the time \u2013 is what led to the plant closings.\u201d\nUp through the early 1970s, more than 80% of US car sales went to the traditional Big Three American carmakers \u2014 General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, which is today owned by Stellantis, according to Wards Automotive, which reports on the auto industry. That market dominance started to decline in the face of Japanese imports. By 2007, the Big Threelost a majorityof US sales for the first time, and in 2024, they made up only 38% of the US market combined.\nThat loss of market share was greatly self-inflicted, said Patrick Anderson, president of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan think tank.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that deficient quality, uninspired design and bad labor relations of 20 to 30 years ago caused lasting wounds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US automakers have recovered from much of that. But before it got there, it did end up bankrupting GM and Chrysler.\u201d\nAnd despite building better quality cars in recent years, those American brands haven\u2019t been able to win back many of the buyers it lost to import brands, he said.\nWhile foreign automakers were winning market share, they were also building their own US plants. But not all auto jobs are made equal.\nMost of those new plants were nonunion factories built in lower-wage \u201cright-to-work\u201d states in the South. Currently, the only exception is a Chattanooga, Tennessee, Volkswagen plantthatvoted to jointhe United Auto Workers union just a year ago.\nLast year, Asian and European brands built 4.9 million vehicles at US plants, edging outthe 4.6 million built by Ford, GM and Stellantis, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. Tesla built an additional 648,000 at its two US plants. That is why even with automation and market share losses, there are more US auto plant assembly jobs today as there were 30 years ago.\nWhile assembly jobs are slightly above their 1994 levels there has been a decline in auto parts jobs.  That\u2019s significant \u2014 nearly twice as many auto workers build parts as perform the final assembly.\nMany of those parts jobs disappeared due to production shifts to Mexico or automation in American plants. And new US auto parts jobs followed the new assembly plants to nonunion states in the South: Michigan has lost half of its 220,000 auto parts jobs since the 1990s, while auto parts jobs in Alabama have more than doubled, according to Miller, the business professor at Michigan State University.\nEven so, there is no doubt that NAFTA led to a boom in assembly plants and auto parts factories in Mexico. Today, virtually every major global automaker has a plant in Mexico to serve the US market. Last year, Mexican plants built 4 million vehicles and shipped 2.5 million of them to American customers, according to S&P Global Mobility.\nUnder NAFTA, and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that Trump negotiated in his first term to take NAFTA\u2019s place, automakers operated as if the three countries were a single market. They built cars and trucks by moving parts and vehicles freely across the borders.\nBut more cars have also been imported from Asia and Europe. Today, South Korea is the second-largest source of car imports behind Mexico, sending 1.4 million cars to US dealers. Japan is right behind with 1.3 million followed by Canada with 1 million and Germany a distant fifth with 430,000 exports, according to S&P Global Mobility.\nDespite its problems, US auto plants still dominate the North American market and are major players globally, unlike other sectors such as textiles and semiconductors.\nLast year, 10.2 millions cars \u2014 or two-thirds of the North American output \u2014were assembled at US plants,according to S&P Global Mobility. That\u2019s enough to account for 55% of the cars purchased in the United States, with 1 million exported to other countries, including Canada and Mexico.\nUS car production is currently down only 14% since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, according to Wards Automotive. That\u2019s even as car production in Mexico has soared 272% since then.\nDespite the arguments made by the Trump administration, tariffs won\u2019t relocate auto plants in foreign countriesto America anytime soon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a minimum of a two-year exercise to pull a plant out of Mexico and move it here,\u201d said Harbour.\nUS assembly plants with excess capacity can\u2019t necessarily start producing the additional models now being built elsewhere. And reopening a plant that has been closed can take years.Even if new auto plants are built, they would need to be highly automated to compete with lower-wage Mexican plants.\n\u201cYou will not see US manufacturing employment numbers go back to the 1990 level due to automation,\u201d said Miller.\nEven members of the Trump administration are talking about automation in new plants, which would mean fewer jobs in any returning plants than the factories of the past.\n\u201cHere\u2019s the key. Factories now can use robotics,\u201d said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a recent interview onCNBC. \u201cSo American workers can be much more efficient with robotics. You\u2019re going to see the greatest surge in \u2026 teaching people how to be robotics mechanics \u2026 it\u2019s a great paying job and it requires a high school education.\u201d\nIt\u2019s more likely that parts plants will shift back to America than assembly plants, said Harbour. But that doesn\u2019t mean there will be significantly more jobs at those factories.\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see some job growth. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a jobs boom,\u201d said Harbour. \u201cIt\u2019s being portrayed to be much larger than I think it will be.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/14\/business\/us-auto-jobs-history-free-trade-automation","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

And other markets, including oil, bonds and the dollar, are sending a clear message of deep skepticism that Trump will be able to pull this one off.\nFollowing another steep sell-off Thursday, stocks appeared calmer \u2014 for now \u2014 and posted strong gains Friday.\nRelated articleWall Street is seeing right through the Trump 2.0 spin\nThe Dow ended the day higher by 619 points, or 1.56%. The S&P 500 rose 1.81% and the Nasdaq was 2.06% higher. Markets were buoyed by Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins telling theFinancial TimesFriday that the central bank would step in to support financial markets if there were signs of distress.\nBut stock market investors have been trading on a knife\u2019s edge, and any announcement coming from the Trump administration on tariffs has the ability to send stocks surging or tumbling. For example, stocks plunged Thursday after the Trump administration clarified the math it had already used to set China\u2019s massive 145% tariff. The street had believed the tariff was 125%. The Dow sank sharply, at one point falling more than 2,000 points.\nIn the 129-year history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the index has closed higher or lower by at least 1,000 points just 31 times. Four of those times happened in the past week.\nThe S&P 500 fell by just over 9% across the first week of April, its biggest one-week drop since March 2020. The benchmark index gained 5.7% this week, its biggest one-week gain since 2023.\nDespite Wednesday\u2019s historic gain after Trump announced his detente, stocks remain well below where they were trading before the president presented his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff plan on April 2.\nThebond market is acting weirdly.\nTypically, you\u2019d expect bond prices to rise throughout periods of turmoil. US Treasuries are historically considered to be the safest of safe assets, backed up by the full faith and credit of the US government.\nBut bonds aren\u2019t rising \u2014 they\u2019re falling.\nThat\u2019s largely because investors have lost faith in US trade policy, and they fear America could get hurt even worse than the countries Trump\u2019s tariff policy is targeting. As JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in hisannual letter to shareholdersMonday, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy risks alienating its most important partners and the country\u2019s special standing in the world.\nRelated articleThe bond market is acting weird. It spooked Trump\nUS Treasury yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, briefly surged on Friday above 4.5%. They were under 4% earlier in the week. That represents a massive move for the market. Higher yields could hurt America\u2019s economy, as a number of consumer loans are closely tied to those rates.\n\u201cThe upward action in rates has been rapid in historical context and has provided no comfort to investors looking for havens in turbulent markets,\u201d analysts at Citi said in a Friday note.\nUS Treasuries were on track for their worst week since 2019, according to Bloomberg\u2019s US Treasury total return index, when theNew York Federal Reserve had to step inand purchase Treasuries to bring down a spike in yields caused by a liquidity crunch.\n\u201cCurrent market conditions don\u2019t require Fed intervention at this point, but Fed officials are likely monitoring market function closely,\u201d said Chip Hughey, managing director for fixed income at Truist Advisory Services.\nDimon said Friday on an earnings call that he expects there will be a \u201ckerfuffle\u201d in the Treasury markets that would lead to the Federal Reserve intervening.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to do it now \u2026 they\u2019ll do it when they start to panic a little bit,\u201d Dimon said.\nThe oil market has been trading like we\u2019re going into a recession.\nPrices have tumbled over the course of the past couple of weeks as investors feared Trump\u2019s trade policy could sap demand for travel, shipping and transportation \u2014 all of which require fuel.\nUS oil on Friday morning fell below $60 a barrel, close to a four-year low, before recovering slightly. Brent, the global benchmark, was hovering around $63 a barrel, the lowest since April 2021, before also gaining slightly.\nOil gained on Friday after US Energy Secretary Chris Wright told reporters that the US could stop Iran\u2019s oil exports as part of Trump\u2019s negotiations over the nation\u2019s nuclear program, according toReuters. US oil settled up 2.4% at $61.50 a barrel. Brent rose 2.26% to $64.76 a barrel.\nYet concerns remain about the impact of tariffs on economic growth and how a potential slowdown could disrupt demand for oil.\nOil prices have served as a prime recession indicator in recent years. Prices tumbled after surging above $100 a barrel for the first time as the Great Recession took hold in 2008. And prices went negative for the first time during the pandemic as a glut of oil became so severe that traders were literally paying storage facilities to take the unwanted oil off their hands.\nThe dollar on Friday tumbled to its lowest level in three years. That\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019d expect when tariffs are put in place.\nTypically, tariffs raise the value of a local currency, because it encourages residents to purchase homemade goods instead of foreign options, stretching their money further in comparison to other currencies.\nBut currency traders have sold off the dollar, because they believe America will bear the brunt of Trump\u2019s trade war fallout and end up comparatively weaker than before tariffs were put in place.\nThe dollar on Friday hit its lowest level against the euro since 2022. The dollar index \u2014 which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies \u2014 fell 0.9% Friday after tanking 2% Thursday, which was its worst single-day drop since 2022. Those are massive moves in currency trading world.\n\u201cInvestors and central banks are selling Treasuries and dollars due to a loss of confidence and credibility in American assets,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist RSM. \u201cFinancial chaos has its cost.\u201d\nMeanwhile, gold prices surged above a record high $3,200 a troy ounce on Friday. Gold is up more than 23% this year and just posted its best quarter since 1986. The yellow metal is considered a safe haven amid economic and political uncertainty.\nDespite financial markets casting enormous doubt that the Trump administration can salvage the opportunity it created for itself to strike bilateral trade agreements with all 150 countries around the world, the Trump administration remains optimistic.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week that more than 70 countries have asked to meet with US representatives to strike a deal that could get them out from under the thumb of Trump\u2019s punishing tariffs. Although the administration has provided few details of which countries it is negotiating with, it said it would favor allies like South Korea and Japan first.\nRelated articleXi says China \u2018not afraid\u2019 as Beijing raises tariffs on US goods to 125% in latest escalation of trade war\nBut trade deals are incredibly complex arrangements usually negotiated over the course of years, not months. And even if Trump were to negotiate trade with all those countries over a short period \u2014 whether full deals or letters of agreement that put a framework of a deal together \u2014 China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter,remains the elephant in the room.\nUS tariffs on China are now at at least 145% andChina on Friday retaliatedwith 125% tariffs of its own. That will do enormous damage to the world\u2019s two largest economies, and both sides have said they are not eager to back down.\nChina has consistently said it is open to negotiations, but wants to do it in a way in which it will be respected. China has ignored America\u2019s warnings not to raise its tariffs, according to a source familiar with the discussions.\nIn the meantime, economists have been unmoved by Trump\u2019s sudden change in tune. Although negotiated trade agreements would undoubtedly be good news for the economy, much of the damage has already been done, Wall Street economists have argued. And punishing 10% universal tariffs remain in place, as do 25% tariffs on autos, 25% tariffs on some goods from Mexico and Canada, and 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum.\nThat\u2019s why JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs say the likelihood of the United States and the global economies going into a recession this year are basically a coin flip.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan and Kyle Atwood contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/11\/investing\/stock-market-dow-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"This key American business sector has a massive trade surplus with the rest of the world. Its jobs are at risk in a trade war","date":"2025-04-11","body":"While the White House wages a trade war on behalf of US manufacturing, the largest and most important part of the American economy \u2014 one that has a trade surplus, not a gap \u2014 is under threat.\nThe US trade gap, caused by American consumers and businesses importing more goods than they\u2019re exporting, has gotten all the attention in the debate over tariffs\nBut we sell far more services than we purchase from other countries. This means the US service sector enjoys a trade surplus with almost every trading partner around the globe, including those at the center of the trade battle: China, the European Union member states, Canada and Mexico.\nAmerica\u2019s trade surplus in services rose to $293 billion in 2024, up 5% from 2023 and up 25% from 2022, according to Commerce Department data.\nService sector businesses \u201care all industries that power American economic growth. They\u2019re the US economy\u2019s secret sauce,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWe sell a lot of services into the rest of the world and these countries know that and they\u2019ll use it against us that if push comes to shove. They can put up trade barriers and enforce new standards before you come into the country.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s why even if tariffs brought back some manufacturing jobs, likely years from now, those US factory jobs may not make up for the loss of service sector jobs.\nThe service sector includes just about anything that doesn\u2019t come out of a factory, farm, mine, or oil well. It includes retailers, restaurants and hotels, as well as software, internet and telecom providers. There are truckers and airlines, movie studios and media companies. It\u2019s also schools and health care providers, lawyers and accountants.\nJobs in the service sector have long driven the US economy, despite the image of a mid-20th century America as a country backed by manufacturers.\nThe service sector employed 57% of private sector non-farm workers in 1939, in the midst of the Great Depression, when the Labor Department started tracking US employment. Today, service sector businesses account for 84% of those jobs.\nRelated articleA lot of US autoworkers like the idea of auto tariffs. But some are being laid off as a result\nManufacturers accounted for as much as 44% of private sector jobs during World War II, but that has been falling steadily since then. Last year, less than 10% of private sector employees worked in manufacturing, according to the Labor Department data. That\u2019s primarily due to automation and the growth of the service sector. Trade is a distant third for the causes of its reduced importance.\nIt\u2019s normal for manufacturing jobs to shrink as a percentage of employment as a country gets wealthier and more technologically advanced, according to Cardiff Garcia, editorial director of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public policy organization.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way an economy evolves,\u201d Garcia\u202ftold CNN on Thursday. \u201cIf you want to employ a big share American workers in manufacturing, you almost have to drag the economy back into the past.\u201d\nEven within the auto industry, the center of much of the tariff dispute, service sector jobs outpace manufacturing jobs. About 1.3 million workers are employed at America\u2019s car dealers, and only 1 million work at US auto plants and parts makers. And number of dealer jobs may fallif tariffs reduce the supply of cars and the price of cars increase, as is expected to happen.\nThat\u2019s especially true for automakers which now face tariffs on all cars destined for their US dealerships, such as Volkswagen-owned Audi, which has no American factories.\n\u201cWhen the president says, \u2018I don\u2019t care if foreign cars are sold in the United States,\u2019 the challenge of that is we have people in the United States employed by foreign car dealerships, you\u2019re somehow saying their jobs are less worthy,\u201d said Jason Miller, a business professor at Michigan State University.\nIf other countries retaliate in response to the US tariffs, that could also take aim at Americans services abroad.\nFor example, China, the second largest market for movie box office, is considering restrictions on US films being exported there.\nIn addition, the European Union could place limitations on American banks to operate as freely there. It is also weighing massive fines for US technology companies.\n\u201cPush too far, and (the EU) could tighten the screws \u2014 digital levies on Silicon Valley, regulatory clamps on Wall Street or taxes on U.S. pharma exports,\u201d said Tobias Gehrke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\nAnd the trade war, and the other Trump administration actions on immigration, could also cut down on the number of college and university students who come here on student visas.\nThere are about 1.1 million international students, making up about 7% of students on all campuses, according to Institute of International Education. The tuition, room and board that they pay is not only crucial to many schools, it also reduces the nation\u2019s trade deficit. But the Trump administration has been revokinghundreds of student visas, and even some students who are not at risk of losing their visas are becoming reluctant to attend American schools in the current environment.\nInternational tourist visits are also expected to drop, potentially costing billions for hotels, restaurants and attractions such as theme parks.\nTourism Economics, a firm that tracks the hospitality industry, forecasts a 9.4% decline in international visitor in the US for 2025, led by a 20.2% decline in visitation from Canada. The firm also estimates that international visitor spending in the US is expected to decline 5%, which would mean a loss of $9 billion this year alone.\nThis is a stark contrast from the end of last year, when Tourism Economics estimated  a nearly 9% increase in international visitors, with a 16% increase in spending by foreign travelers.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s policies and pronouncements have produced a negative sentiment shift toward the US among international travelers,\u201d said a statement from Tourism Economics.\nOn Wednesday, Delta Air Lines said it\u2019s expecting less travel by Americans in the second half of this year; the airline will cut the seat additions that it had planned for 2025 and will trim its payrolls through attrition. CEO Ed Bastian said he now sees a recession as likely.\nAnd there will be fewer jobs or skimpier paychecks moving goods, as well. American trucking employs 1.5 million and warehousing and storage another 1.8 million, according to the Labor Department.\nAbout 40% of the cargo moving through the Port of Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s largest, is coming from or going to China, said Gene Seroka, the port\u2019s executive director. He projects a 10% drop in cargo in the second half of this year due to tariffs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to see mass layoffs. But the amount of work will be much less than it traditionally has been,\u201d he said.\nThe biggest danger to service jobs, though, comes from the possibility of a tariff-sparked recession, with cash-strapped Americans spending less and businesses failing or pulling back.\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re a service economy, services take the brunt of that,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cHealth care, education, financial services. Every industry gets nailed in a recession.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/11\/business\/service-sector-trade-war-jobs-threat","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Fact check: Trump falsely says Europe doesn\u2019t buy anything from US, wildly exaggerates trade deficit with China","date":"2025-04-07","body":"Speaking to reportersSunday on Air Force One, PresidentDonald Trumpdefended his new global tariffs with a familiar series of false claims about tariffs and trade.\nAs he hasbefore, Trump wildly exaggerated the US trade deficit with China \u2014 describing it as more than three times higher than it actually is. He repeated hisfrequent false claimthat China paid the tariffs he imposed during his first presidency on imported Chinese products; these payments were made by US importers. And he once again falsely described trade with Europe, wrongly saying the continent doesn\u2019t buy \u201canything\u201d from the US. In reality, the European Union purchased about $649 billion worth of US exports in 2024.\nTrump\u2019s Sunday remarks also included inaccurate assertions about other subjects, but we\u2019ll stick to tariffs and trade in this article. Here is a fact check.\nTrump said Sunday that the US has a trade deficit with China of $1 trillion or more.\n\u201cWe have a tremendous deficit problem with China. They have a surplus of at least a trillion dollars a year. I think it\u2019s like a trillion-one,\u201d he said.\nlive updatesMarkets plunge on Trump\u2019s tariffs as Netanyahu visits White House\nAs we\u2019venotedin previous fact checks, those numbers are not close to accurate. In fact,official federal statisticsshow the 2024 trade deficit with China in goods and services trade was about $263 billion. Even if you exclude the services trade, at which the US excels, and count only trade in goods, the 2024 deficit with China was about $295 billion.\nThe US has never approached a $1 trillion trade deficit with China. The deficit in goods trade alonehit a recordof about $418 billion under Trump in 2018 before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years.\nTrump repeated his regular assertion that China paid the tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports during his first presidency, wrongly declaring, \u201cI took in, during my four year(s), hundreds of billions of dollars from China.\u201d\nIn fact, US importers, not foreign exporters like China,make the tariff paymentsto the US government, andstudy after studyhas found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs on China. It\u2019s easy to findspecific examplesof companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.\nTrump made a series of false claims about trade with Europe, all repeats fromprevious comments.\nHe said Sunday: \u201cThey don\u2019t take our cars. They don\u2019t take our food products. They don\u2019t take anything. And we take their cars: Mercedes, Volkswagen, BMW. You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don\u2019t take our farm product.

While the European Union certainly hassome trade barriersthat make it harder for US companies to export products there, theofficial federal statisticsshow the US\u202fexported about $649 billion worth\u202fof goods and services to the European Union in 2024.\nIt\u2019s similarly false that \u201cthey don\u2019t take our farm products.\u201d While the EU does have sometrade barriersthat impede US agricultural exports, the US Department of Agriculturesaysthe EU bought $12.8 billion worth of US agricultural exports in 2024, making it the fourth-largest export market for US agricultural and related products behind Mexico, Canada and China.\nAnd while US automakers have often struggled to succeed in Europe, Trump went too far when he said, \u201cThey take no cars.\u201d According to areportlast month from the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, \u201c164,857 US-made cars were exported to the EU in 2024,\u201d valued at about $8.4 billion at current exchange rates.

{"title":"Trump\u2019s tariff threats are hurting your job prospects","date":"2025-03-26","body":"One in four US businesses has scaled back their hiring plans because of the turmoil unleashed by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, according to a survey of chief financial officers released Wednesday.\nThe quarterly survey, conducted by Duke University and the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Atlanta, found a significant drop in CFO economic optimism as they grapple with the fog of the trade war. Almost all of their post-election increase in optimism faded.\nThe tariff chaos has caused a deer-in-headlights moment for many firms. Executives don\u2019t know how high tariffs will go, what products will be affected, or how long they\u2019ll stay in place. Faced with deep uncertainty, some businesses are pulling back.\nAbout 25% of CFOs say they have cut their 2025 hiring plans due to tariffs, according to the survey, which was conducted Feb. 18 to March 7. About 70% said trade policy will have no change to their hiring plans, while only 6% reported an increase.\nLikewise, 25% of CFOs say they have cut their capital spending plans this year because of trade policy.\n\u201cTariffs are first-order concern. At least in the short run, they are a great risk,\u201d John Graham, professor of finance at Duke\u2019s Fuqua School of Business, told CNN in a phone interview.\nOnly a \u201cfew\u201d firms reported changing plans on hiring and spending because of immigration or corporate tax policy, the survey found.\nIn a statement to CNN, the White House said Trump\u2019s economic agenda has already led to trillions of dollars of investments in the US, adding: \u201cPresident Trump used tariffs to unleash historic economic, investment, job, and wage growth in his first term with no inflation, and he\u2019ll repeat the magic again in his second term.\u201d\nThe Duke CFO survey found that despite their worries about tariffs, own-firm optimism among CFOs fell more modestly than their economic optimism.\nTariffs have catapulted up the worry list in Corporate America in recent weeks.\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, CFOs were asked for the most pressing concern facing their businesses. Tariffs only ranked No. 9.\nNow, tariffs are No. 1 \u2014 by a long shot. In fact, Graham said the gap between tariffs and the No. 2 issue is the widest since the survey started asking the question 20 years ago.\nRelated articleConsumer confidence plummets to lowest level since January 2021\nOf course, unlike some of those other leading fears in the past such as Covid-19 and toxic mortgages, tariffs are part of an intentional White House policy aimed at leveling the playing field on trade.\n\u201cIt\u2019s self-inflicted, both because of the tariffs themselves and because of the way the tariffs have been rolled out,\u201d Graham said.\nTrump has endorsed tariffs as a critical tool in his policy arsenal. He has held up tariffs as a way to address a range of issues, including unfair trade tactics, high budget deficits, the loss of manufacturing jobs, perceived threats to the US dollar, illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl into the United States.\nYet the on-again, off-again nature of the trade war during Trump\u2019s second term has rattled investors, weighed on crumbling consumer confidence and unnerved some business owners.\n\u201cI\u2019m losing sleep over tariffs. A president has never made me lose sleep before,\u201d said Ryan Messenger, CEO of First Rate Blinds, a family-owned business that sells blinds, shades, shutters and drapes.\nMessenger, a North Carolina father of four who switched from voting for President Joe Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024, is alarmed by the roughly 20% increase in costs due to tariffs for some products his firm imports from Mexico.\nHis company plans to absorb a portion of the cost of the tariffs, eating into its bottom line, and pass along the rest to consumers in the form of significantly higher prices.\n\u201cSome people might not buy new shades,\u201d Messenger said of the higher prices.\nMessenger said the volatile trade policy has caused problems for his business. For instance, it\u2019s not always clear what imports from Mexico are temporarily exempt from Trump\u2019s 25% tariff on Mexico because they are compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade agreement Trump signed during his first term.\n\u201cEveryone is scrambling and confused. It\u2019s so messed up,\u201d Messenger said, adding that some suppliers are increasing prices ahead of tariffs.\nTariffs could cause businesses to pull back on hiring due to higher costs and uncertainty.\nOne commercial builder in the CFO survey said: \u201cTariffs are a major concern \u2026 the potential cost escalation of imported raw materials will negatively impact us.\u201d\nHiring plans can also be hurt by retaliatory tariffs lobbed by foreign countries on products made in America. Those tariffs can hurt demand for US goods.\nMessenger said he\u2019s not shocked that Trump is using tariffs, noting this was a campaign promise.\n\u201cTrump said he was going to do it. But I figured there\u2019d be more thought involved. And it would just be a tool to get a better deal. But he\u2019s the one who made the deal!\u201d Messenger said, referring to USMCA.\nThe CFO survey is just the latest example of deteriorating sentiment around the economy.\nA separate report, released Tuesday by The Conference Board, found that consumer confidence plunged in March to the lowest level since January 2021.\nOf course, shifts in sentiment alone won\u2019t necessarily damage the economy. Only real changes in behavior by consumers and businesses will.\nFormer Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore is increasingly worried about the ongoing plunge in consumer confidence.\n\u201cThe reason I\u2019m concerned is that perception can become reality,\u201d Moore, a senior visiting fellow in economics at The Heritage Foundation, told CNN in a phone interview on Tuesday. \u201cIf people stop spending, that\u2019s going to affect the real economy. That\u2019s the worry.\u201d\nMoore blamed the drop in consumer confidence on political polarization andtrade-war driven turbulence on Wall Street. He predicted a sustained recovery in stock prices will inspire a rebound in confidence.\n\u201cMy policy advice for Republicans: Stop talking about tariffs and get the tax cuts done quickly,\u201d Moore said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/26\/economy\/trump-tariffs-trade-war-jobs-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

His remarks came just hours ahead of a meeting between US and Canadian officials on trade.\nThat meeting was \u201cvery, very productive,\u201d Ford told reporters after it ended, adding that he felt that \u201cthe temperature is being lowered.\u201d Ford said he plans to meet again with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick next week.\nMeanwhile, Canada has requested consultation with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over US tariffs on steel and aluminum, the WTO said ina statementon Thursday. Canada claims the tariffs violate trade rules.\nIt\u2019s easy to see how this trade war can quickly get out of hand. If world leaders aren\u2019t careful, they can get stuck in an escalatory cycle that\u2019s hard to escape.\n\u201cThis game has exploded into other areas,\u201d said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nIt\u2019s not just the US-Canada trade fight.\nChina respondedto Trump\u2019s initial 10% tariff hike in February by announcing retaliatory tariffs as well as new export controls and by adding Calvin Klein owner PVH Group to a government blacklist.\nThe European Union on Wednesdayfired backat Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs by taking aim at American jeans, boats and whiskey, much to the dismay of the US liquor industry.\nAsked about the retaliatory EU tariffs, Trump said: \u201cOf course I will respond.\u201d\nAnd then he did.\nTrump on Thursdaythreatened a massive tariff\u2014 200% \u2014 on wine, champagne and other European alcohol.\nIn other words, Trump has retaliated against the EU\u2019s retaliation to Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nWhat if the EU retaliates to that?\nThe trade war escalation has alarmed investors,CEOsand economists \u2014 not to mention agrowing chunk of the American public.\n\u201cIs this going to spiral out of control?\u201d Kent Smetters, faculty director of the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Model, told CNN in an interview.\nSmetters, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, where Trump graduated from, now thinks it\u2019s a \u201ctoss-up\u201d whether the US economy stumbles into a recession this year.\nThe broadening out of the trade war was somewhat predictable.\nAfter all, Trump is applying tariffs, a trade tool, to areas unrelated to trade such as immigration, fentanyl and protecting the dominance of the US dollar. Trump has even floated the use of tariffs to pressure Russia into a peace deal.\n\u201cThis is Donald Trump\u2019s Windex. He sprays it on everything,\u201d Lovely said, likening the president\u2019s love of tariffs to the dad in \u201cMy Big Fat Greek Wedding\u201d who thinks Windex can solve any problem. \u201cAny restraint we had over commercial policy staying in the commercial policy lane is gone. But I do have to say that in this case, the US started it.\u201d\nAnd Trump has signaled he\u2019s not ending it anytime soon.\nDespite growing pushback from Wall Street, Trump has threatened a wide range of additional tariffs, including reciprocal tariffs scheduled for April 2. Those looming tariffs, if they move forward, could trigger further retaliation.\n\u201cThe last few weeks have reminded us that trade is emotional. Countries can take things personally. And there are big personalities involved these days,\u201d said Christine McDaniel, senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center and a former trade official under President George W. Bush.\nFord, the Canadian politician who threatened to shut off US electricity and briefly slapped a 25% surcharge on electricity exports, hasemerged as a particularly vocal opponentof Trump\u2019s trade policy.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, on the other hand, has taken a different approach. Sheinbaum said Wednesday that her country would wait until April 2 before responding to Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nAll of this is just adding to the uncertainty facing investors and business leaders.\n\u201cHuman behavior is very difficult to model and predict. Trade economists had it pretty easy for 30 years. But we don\u2019t have models for this new world,\u201d said McDaniel.\nThere is growing concern in Corporate America about the fallout of the trade war.\nThe Business Roundtable said Wednesday that its CEO Economic Outlook Index has dimmed and CEOs have cut their plans to hire and invest.\nThe vast majority (85%) of CEOs oppose Trump\u2019s approach to trade, according to a straw poll of roughly 100 major US CEOs at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute CEO Caucus.\nThe Yale event, held in Washington on Tuesday and featuring the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Pfizer, American Airlines and other firms, revealed that 94% of CEOs polled are worried tariffs will be inflationary and 85% believe Trump\u2019s tariffs are backfiring.\nJeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, told CNN that business leaders universally believe there are legitimate reasons to apply tariffs selectively. But Sonnenfeld said CEOs are \u201cangry\u201d over the shifting justifications offered by the administration for Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\u201cThe broad-sweeping assault on allies instead of adversarial and rival nations has CEOs dismayed and embarrassed,\u201d Sonnenfeld said in an email.\nOf course, it\u2019s too early to know how the trade war will evolve \u2014 and what the ultimate impact will be on the economy and financial markets.\nForeign leaders may be reluctant to continue the escalatory cycle so as not to further damage their local economies.\n\u201cThey understand tariffs are bad for their economies. That could be a natural break in this tit-for-tat,\u201d said Lovely.\nIt\u2019s also possible that Trump is forced to dial back the tariff pressure if the US economy starts to really weaken or if Wall Street throws an even bigger temper tantrum.\n\u201cThe president is in a tight spot, and every tariff (or threatened tariff) makes his position more difficult,\u201d Simon Johnson, head of MIT\u2019s Global Economics and Management group, told CNN in an email. \u201cIf he keeps going in this direction, prices will rise and the economy will slow even further.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/13\/economy\/trade-wars-can-spiral-out-of-control","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"Fact check: Trump wildly exaggerates trade deficits with Canada, Mexico, China and the EU","date":"2025-03-06","body":"President Donald Trump hasfor yearswildly exaggerated the size of US trade deficits with various other countries. Now, as Trump cites those trade deficits as a key justification for his tariff policies,newly released federal statisticsshow just how wrong Trump\u2019s numbers are.\nPreviously released federal figures for 2023 and part of 2024 had already shown that Trump\u2019s claims about the US deficits with Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union were way off. Now, the Department of Commerce has published full-year 2024 figures that allow us to say precisely how far off.\nThe figures were released Thursday, hours before Trump announced a pause, until April 2, on his tariffs on Canadian and Mexican productscovered by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreementhe signed in his first term.\nBefore we get into the data, a quick reminder: Having a trade deficit with another country means the US imports more goods and services from the country than the US exports. Though Trump often describes trade deficits as subsidies or losses, having a deficitdoes not meanthe US is giving away money for nothing.\nFor example, the US trade deficit with Canada exists largely because the US imports alarge quantity of cheap Canadian heavy crude oilthat helps keep gas prices down for American drivers.\nTrump, who on Tuesday imposed 25% tariffs on almost all imports from Canada (10% on energy), has repeatedlysaidthis year that the US has a \u201c$200 billion\u201d trade deficit with Canada \u2013 sometimes making the claimexplicitlyand sometimes using vaguer language about a supposed $200 billionsubsidyorlossto Canada.\nTrump\u2019s number is not even close to correct. The new federal statistics show the 2024 deficit with Canada in goods and services trade was $35.7 billion, down from $40.6 billion in 2023.\nEven if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade at which the US excels, the 2024 deficit with Canada was $70.6 billion. It was $72.3 billion in 2023.\nTrump also imposed 25% tariffs on products imported from Mexico. Hesaidin a Fox News interview in February, \u201cWe have a deficit with Mexico of $350 billion.\u201d\nAgain, that\u2019s distant from reality. The new federal figures show the 2024 deficit with Mexico in goods and services trade was $179 billion, up from $162.1 billion in 2023.\nThe 2024 deficit with Mexico in goods trade alone was $181.5 billion, up from $161.4 billion in 2023.\nTrump, who has imposed aseries of tariffsin his first and second presidential terms on products imported from China,saidin a Fox News Radio interview in February that \u201cwe have a deficit with China of over $1 trillion.\u201d He repeated the \u201c$1 trillion\u201d number in a Februaryspeech.\nThat, too, is a massive exaggeration. The new federal figures show that the 2024 deficit with China in goods and services trade was $263.3 billion. That\u2019s up from $252.1 billion in 2023 \u2013 but lower than ineveryyearof Trump\u2019s first presidency.\nTrade deficits rise and fall fornumerous reasonsother than presidential policy. We mention the fact that Biden-era deficits were lower than Trump-era deficits, though, because Trump hasclaimedthat Biden let the deficit with China \u201cget out of hand.\u201d\nThe 2024 deficit with China in goods trade alone was $295.2 billion, up from $278.7 billion in 2023.\nTrump has regularly, andincorrectly, castigated the European Union over its trade practices. Hetold reportersin February that \u201cwith the European Union, it\u2019s, you know, $350 billion deficit.\u201d Hesaidat a subsequent February event that it\u2019s \u201cabout a $300 billion deficit with the European Union.\u201d\nWrong once more. The new federal figures show that the 2024 deficit with the European Union in goods and services trade was $161.1 billion, up from $125.1 billion in 2023.\nThe 2024 deficit with the European Union in goods trade alone was $236.7 billion, up from $201.6 billion in 2023. So, counting only goods trade, Trump\u2019s claims about the deficit with the European Union are a bit closer to the truth than his claims about the deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China \u2013 but they\u2019re still not actually close to the truth.\nThis article has been updated with additional information.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/06\/politics\/us-trade-tariffs-trump-fact-check","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

In February, the share of respondents who believe it is a good time to expand saw its biggest monthly decline since April 2020.\n\u201cUncertainty is high and rising on Main Street, and for many reasons,\u201d Bill Dunkelberg, the NFIB\u2019s chief economist, said in a release. \u201cConfidence that the economy will continue to grow is fading.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s whipsawing trade policy has unsettled America\u2019s decision makers and ignited fearsof inflation picking back up. Recession fears are also taking hold, and on Sunday, Trump refused to rule out an economic downturn this year, whichsent major stock indexes reeling.\nAll of that is now confusing a large swath of the US economy, according to the NFIB\u2019s latest survey. The White House has frequently pointed to NFIB data as an indication of economic strength \u2013 a November survey following Trump\u2019s election showed small business optimism rose by the most in any month in history. But since then, optimism has fallen.\nThere are more than 33 million small businesses in the United States,according to the Small Business Administration, which employs nearly half of all private-sector workers. A looming global trade war, which threatens to jack up prices, coupled with signs of a sputtering economy, is giving small businesses some pause.\n\u201cThe uncertainty we face in the economy has no set timeline,\u201d Mark Valentino, head of business banking at Citizens Bank, said in commentary issued Tuesday. \u201cBusiness owners are reevaluating vendor contracts, labor force and borrowing strategies.\u201d\nHe said tariffs are raising concerns among small businesses of higher costs, which means they\u2019re likely taking a hard look at their cash flow and reviewing other financial statements to \u201cidentify areas for improvement.\u201d\nEarlier this month, Trump kept his promise of imposing a blanket 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada, after delaying them for a month \u2014then quickly lifted tariffs for all Canadian and Mexican importsthat fall under a North American free trade agreement. Meanwhile, Trump doubled tariffs on China to 20%, on top of existing duties.\nThe Trump administration has said it\u2019s not done with its overhaul of US trade policy, promising to deliver tariffs that match other countries\u2019 dollar for dollar, or so-called reciprocal tariffs, on April 2.\n\u201cThe Trump administration is putting American jobs, products and strength first,\u201d Kelly Loeffler, the administrator of the Small Business Administration, said Monday at a press conference in Indianapolis.\nThe administration is also clamping down on immigration \u2014 both legal and otherwise \u2014 which is forcing small businesses to \u201cremain cautious in this regard as well,\u201d Valentino said.\nThat could raise labor costs for certain industries such as construction and agriculture, and in the NFIB\u2019s latest survey, the share of respondents deeming labor costs as their biggest problem jumped in February and was \u201conly one point below the survey\u2019s highest reading of 13% reached in December 2021,\u201d according to a release.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/11\/economy\/small-business-uncertainty-nfib","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"US retail spending plunged last month, falling for the first time since August","date":"2025-02-14","body":"American shoppers pulled back on their spending last month for the first time since August asstubborn inflation continued to biteand harsh weather curbed economic activity.\nRetail sales plunged 0.9% in January from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Friday. That\u2019s down sharply from December\u2019s upwardly revised 0.7% gain and well below economists\u2019 expectations of a 0.4% decline. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation.\nShoppers reined in their spending across multiple categories last month. Specialty stores and auto dealers were hit hardest, with spending falling 4.6% and 3%, respectively.\nUS stocks were mostly flat Friday morning at market open, with all three major indexes up just 0.1%.\nA key measure that excludes volatile components, referred to as the \u201ccontrol group,\u201d was down 0.8% in January. Spending at restaurants, bars and department stores remained in positive territory last month.\nRelated articleKey takeaways from Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s congressional hearing\nSales at retailers and food establishments account for about a third of overall spending in the US. The American economy is driven by consumer spending, accounting for about 70% of economic output.\nInflation is down considerably from the 40-year highs of summer 2022, but it has shownsigns of getting stuckin recent months. That\u2019s a big reason why the Federal Reserve is holding off on additional interest rate cuts, after delivering three consecutive cuts last year.\nInflation could worsen if President Donald Trump keeps his promise of imposing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada as soon as March 1. The Trump administration is also weighing levying reciprocal tariffs in April. Most economists say Trump\u2019s hefty duties would likely ramp up price pressures in the US, contrary tothe Trump administration\u2019s beliefthat foreign countries will pay for the tariffs.\nWhile the government\u2019s retail figures are adjusted for seasonality, unusually cold weather in recent years has had an outsized impact on people\u2019s spending behavior, typically in January.\nThat means the latest figures might not be fully representative of the US consumer\u2019s health. January\u2019s decline also comes after a strong gain in the prior month.\n\u201cThe drop was dramatic, but several mitigating factors show there\u2019s no cause for alarm,\u201d said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an analyst note Friday. \u201cSome of it can be chalked up to bad weather, and some to auto sales tanking in January after an unusual surge in December due to fat dealer incentives. Especially considering December was revised up strongly, the rolling average of consumer spending remains solid.\u201d\nLast month was also when blazing wildfires ravaged Los Angeles, which may have kept Americans in the country\u2019s second-largest city hunkered down.\n\u201cWe will need to wait until the February data to see if this is the start of a more cautious consumer trend or indeed whether it was simply a weather related pull back and we get a subsequent big gain,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, in commentary issued Friday.\nFriday\u2019s report doesn\u2019t move the needle for the Fed.\nWall Street is still betting with near certainty that the central bank will stand pat at its March 18-19 meeting, according to futures, after central bankers paused rate cuts last month. That\u2019s mostly because recent inflation data has come in hotter than expected and the job market is holding steady, with unemployment at a low 4%.\nFor the Fed to begin cutting again, it would need to see either inflation back on track toward the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the job market weakening more than expected, or even a combination of the two, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told congressional lawmakers this week during his semiannual testimony on monetary policy.\nThe biggest wild card for the Fed this year is the Trump administration and its policies, such as stiff tariffs, mass deportations, deregulation and slashing the size of the federal government\u2019s workforce. It\u2019s not clear how those policies put together will ultimately affect the US economy.\n\u201cMy view is until we have more clarity, it\u2019s going to be impossible to make a judgment about where our policy should go and how fast and at what pace, and so we\u2019re just going to have to get more information before we\u2019re going to be able to move,\u201d Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday at an event in Atlanta in reference to the Trump administration\u2019s promises and actions.

{"title":"With tariffs and trade in the spotlight, what Trump means when he says America is \u2018losing\u2019 billions to Canada, others","date":"2025-01-16","body":"When President-elect Donald Trump recentlyfloated the idea of annexing Canada, a key reason he gave was a claim that the United States was \u201closing $200 billion a year\u201d to its northern neighbor.\nSpeaking atMar-a-Lago last week, Trump didn\u2019t specify what constituted the $200 billion, but he used the figure in the context of how the US \u201csubsidized\u201d Canada and also had a \u201cmassive\u201d trade deficit for items \u2014such as cars and lumber\u2014 that he said the US does not need.\nThe lion\u2019s share of the $200 billion was attributed to US defense spending of which Canada directly benefits, and the remainder is from the trade deficit, a Trump-Vance transition official told CNN.\nIn 2023, the US had a trade deficit of $67.9 billion dollars with Canada,Commerce Department data shows.\nTrade policy hasonce againlanded in the spotlight as Trump isexpected to wield tariffsand other measures as key policy levers during his second administration.\nRelated articleCanada is preparing to strike back hard with retaliatory tariffs if Trump starts a trade war\nHowever, some economists caution that exaggerating or classifying trade deficits as losses or subsidies isn\u2019t a fair representation of what has become a crucial mechanism for the US economy.\n\u201cThe President-elect sees the world as a zero-sum game: Anything that\u2019s not made here or bought elsewhere is considered a loss, which simply isn\u2019t the case,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN.\nGary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, put it another way.\n\u201cThat\u2019s like saying that I lose $25,000 a year to Albertsons, where I do my shopping,\u201d he said.\nIn simple terms,a trade deficit resultsfrom when the value of a country\u2019s imports exceeds the overall value of exports.\nAnd for much of the past 50 years,the US has had a trade deficit, driven by goods (America runs a growing surplus on services).\nThat trade gap widened significantly in the 1990s as globalization accelerated, the American economy boomed and consumers and businesses purchased more from abroad. The deficit hit north of $700 billion in the mid-aughts before global trade and the US economy constricted considerably during the Great Recession.\nThe deficit hovered between $400 billion and $550 billion from 2009 to 2016, during the Obama administration, and moved closer to $600 billionduring Trump\u2019s first term.\nAnd then Covid-19 came along.\nIn theeconomic recovery that followed, consumption soared for goods and services \u2014 both those from overseas as well as domestically \u2014 while some exports took a hit as the demand from other countrieslagged that seen in the US. (Other factors contributing to the pandemic-era deficit widening included a shift in oil and petroleum trade from surplus to deficit while the trade surplus decreased because of restrictions on foreign nationals and rising shipping costs, White House economistswrote in 2022).\nThe US trade deficit widened toa record $945 billion in 2022, narrowed to $785 billion in 2023, but wasexpected to widen againin 2024 in part due to economic expansion and consumer demand,an increase in shipmentsin preparation for potential port strikes or a rise in tariffs, as well as the strong dollar weighing on exports, economists noted.\nIn 2023, in addition to the $67.9 billion deficit with Canada (which narrowed from the year before), the US narrowed its deficit with Canada to $274.9 billion from $382.3 billion, and the deficit with Mexico \u2014now America\u2019s biggest trading partner\u2014 increased $21.9 billion to $152.4 billion, Commerce Departmentdata shows.\nThe $945 billion overall trade deficit represents about 2.8% of gross domestic product, which falls in line with therange seen since 2010, according to World Bank data.\nTrade balances factor heavily into current account balances \u2014 a broad measure of countries\u2019 international transactions that also include personal and government transfer payments. The current account balance (of which the US has a deficit) is offset by the capital and financial accounts (US has a surplus), which include foreign asset transactions and international debt forgiveness.\n\u201cFrom my analytical framework, global trade balances plus global capital flows equal zero,\u201d Brusuelas said. \u201cSo, if we want to buy maple syrup from our friends across the border, that just adds variety, quality and choice of my consumption; it doesn\u2019t take away or cause a loss for our economy because presumably the Canadians then get those dollars and buy US services \u2014 typically financial services, government debt, bonds, equities.\u201d\nTrade deficits aren\u2019t necessarily inherently terrible, economists say, noting they can be a reflection of a strong economy and the power of the US in stimulating the economies of trading partners elsewhere.\n\u201cYou obviously want to run closer to balance if possible,\u201d Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN. \u201cBut there can be efficiencies made by importing certain goods that are produced more cheaply abroad or produced more as a specialty of a certain economy.\u201d\nCoffee purchased from Central America is one example of a specialized product with no readily available substitute; however, heavily reliance on a certain country or product can backfire, as seen during the pandemic recovery.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be running such large deficits that it makes you dependent on a certain economy for certain things,\u201d said Grein. \u201cWe saw this come to a head during the pandemic with things like semiconductors.\u201d\nRelated articleTrump\u2019s quest for Greenland could make Ozempic even more expensive\nWhen relying heavily on a certain economy for specific items, that can easily crimp a supply chain and lead to other challenges, she said.\nOther risks come with the US persistently spending more than it earns and financing the difference with foreign investment, according to PIIE.\nThe US has to borrow more or attract investment from abroad, which can increase foreign-based financial claims in America. That in turn could cause higher debt or interest rate burdens and national security concerns.\nThe increase in imported goods also can negatively affect manufacturing jobs, which also suffered because of increased automation and improvements in technology, PIIE noted.\nStill, according to PIIE, imports can allow consumers to purchase items (including those exclusive to other countries that can\u2019t be produced domestically) for a lower cost and spur economic growth while the increased foreign investment can result in jobs, higher wages, technology advancement and enhanced productivity.\nThere are potential avenues to reduce the trade deficit, some more painful than others (such as a recession); but bilateral trade restrictions or tariffs likely will not achieve that outcome, said Hufbauer.\n\u201cIf you try to squeeze the deficit with one country \u2014 for example, China \u2014 it\u2019s just going to migrate over, the goods are going to come from some other source (such as) Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, Korea, wherever can produce the most similar type of goods,\u201d Hufbauer told CNN, noting those shifts occurred in recent years when tariffs were placed on Chinese goods.\nIt\u2019s possible that Trump could instead insist on some bilateral balance provision, such as requiring European Union countriesto purchase US natural gas or specific products, he said. However, that could require more capacity than the US has at this time when unemployment is still low, he added.\nSome of the most effective tools in reducing trade deficits are those that impact how much people, businesses and governments save, according to PIIE.\nThe US trade deficit could very well hit $1 trillion when the Commerce Department releases its 2024 data next month. China, on the other hand, just reported a nearly $1 trillion surplus.\nRelated articleChina\u2019s exports surge amid trade tensions\nWhile both reflect some \u201cfront-loading\u201din advance of potential tariffs, the chasm goes beyond economics or finance, said Brusuelas, the RSM economist.\nThe $1 trillion deficit and surplus risk \u201caltering the political economy of the US,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRather, it feeds into the great global competition, which has opened the door for trade protectionism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is what underscores the bi-partisan consensus that China must be confronted on national security grounds and has triggered the move to protect infant industries such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and synthetic biology to ensure that China does not increase its power \u2014 both economic and political \u2014 relative to that of the United States via trade and technology transfers.\u201d\nTrade tensions can have negative effects that ripple through economies, industries and companies.\nBoeing, for example, is America\u2019s largest exporter and therefore highly exposed to any trade war. China is the largest global market for new aircraft purchases, with Boeing forecasting that China\u2019s fleet of commercial jets will double in the next 20 years.\nThe aircraft maker has been down this road before. The company\u2019s sales to China ground to a near-halt in 2017 as trade tensions between the two countries escalated during Trump\u2019s first term. Orders from Chinese buyers fell from 64 in 2016 to 51 in 2017 to zero in both 2018 and 2019. A similar drop could occur if a new trade war breaks out.\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t know what Trump will do with Chinese tariffs,\u201d Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an industry consultant, told CNN in November. \u201cBut if he slaps 60% tariffs on all Chinese goods, the quickest way for China to retaliate is to switch to (Boeing rival) Airbus for 100% of its needs.\u201d\nThis potential Cold War plays directly into questions about the sustainability of both the annual operating deficits and the overall national debt, Brusuelas said.\n\u201cIt means that the US isentering uncharted terrain with respect to financing a new geopolitical competition at a time when interest on the debt is one of the largest line-item entries inside the national budget,\u201d he said. \u201cThis requires trade-offs. One cannot have as much guns and butter as one wants, given the political, economic, financial and social constraints that accompanies such a competition.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/16\/economy\/us-trade-deficit-trump-200-billion","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"China\u2019s exports surge amid trade tensions","date":"2025-01-13","body":"China\u2019s exports gained momentum in December, with imports also showing recovery, though strength at the year-end was in part fueled by factories rushing inventory overseas as they braced for heightened trade risks under a Trump presidency.\nExports have been a vital growth engine for the $18 trillion economy, which is still burdened by a prolonged property crisis and shaky consumer confidence. While policymakers can find solace in recent policy measures keeping the economy on track for an \u201caround 5%\u201d growth target, challenges such as potential US tariff hikes cloud the outlook for 2025.\nUS President-elect Donald Trump, set to return to the White House next week, has proposed hefty tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking fears of a renewed trade war between the two superpowers.\nAdding to the challenges, unresolved disputes with the European Union over tariffs of up to 45.3% on Chinese electric vehicles threaten to hinder China\u2019s ambitions to expand its auto exports and help address deflationary overcapacity concerns.\n\u201cTrade front-loading became more visible in December as a result of both Chinese New Year effects and Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration,\u201d said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. China\u2019s biggest festival runs from January 28 to February 4.\n\u201cImport growth could be underpinned by stockpiling of commodities like copper and iron ore, as part of (China\u2019s) \u2018buy low\u2019 strategy,\u201d he added.\nOutbound shipments in December rose 10.7% year-on-year, customs data showed on Monday, beating 7.3% growth forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and improving from November\u2019s 6.7% increase.\nImports surprised to the upside with 1.0% growth, the strongest performance since July 2024. Economists had expected a 1.5% decline.\nChina\u2019s trade surplus grew to $104.8 billion last month, up from $97.4 billion in November. Its trade surplus with the US widened to $33.5 billion over the same period from $29.81 billion a month prior.\nA Chinese customs spokesperson told reporters there was still \u201chuge\u201d room for China\u2019s imports to grow this year.\nBuoyed by a weakening yuan, Chinese manufacturers managed to find buyers overseas in 2024 to compensate for depressed domestic demand by continually reducing prices, analysts said.\nAs a result, China\u2019s exports grew by an annual 5.9% last year, while imports increased just 1.1% over the same period.\n\u201cThe double-digit rise in December exports (led by the US and ASEAN), along with the increase in the PMI new export orders, supports our earlier judgment that the threat of tariffs could affect export patterns in the next couple of quarters, with a potential boost in shipments before the introduction of new tariffs, followed by a drop-off,\u201d Barclays analysts said in a note.\n\u201cOverall, we think the modest increase in imports and easing CPI inflation suggest the recent domestic demand recovery is still too shallow and too weak.\u201d\nMarket reaction was muted to the trade data. The yuan hovered near 16-month lows against the dollar, while key share indexes were down.\nSigns of stabilization have emerged following China\u2019s recent stimulus push.\nFactory activity remained in modest expansion for the third consecutive month, while services and construction recovered in December, an official survey showed.\nSouth Korea, a key indicator of China\u2019s imports, reported a 8.6% increase in shipments to China in December, suggesting resilience in demand for technology products.\nChina\u2019s iron ore imports in 2024 rose for a second straight year to hit a new peak, as lower prices spurred buying and demand remained resilient despite the country\u2019s protracted property crisis continuing to weigh on steel demand.\nThe world\u2019s largest agricultural importer also bought a record amount of soybeans last year, after buyers concerned about US-China trade tensions rushed to secure US soybeans ahead of incoming US president Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.\nBut crude oil imports fell last year, the data showed, marking its first annual decline in the last two decades outside the Covid-19 pandemic-induced falls, as tepid economic growth and peaking fuel consumption dampened purchases.\nChina\u2019s top leaders have pledged to loosen monetary policy and adopt a more proactive fiscal policy in 2025, aiming to offset external pressures and revitalize domestic demand.\nThe government is targeting economic growth of around 5% for the year, a goal that had proved challenging to achieve at times in 2024.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/13\/business\/china-exports-trade-tension-hnk-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The dirty secret of America\u2019s holiday shopping season","date":"2025-11-25","body":"Americans, enraged about years of rising prices, are going into the 2025 holiday shopping seasonprepared for battle. But this holiday shopping season could look a lot stronger than you\u2019d expect \u2013 on paper, anyway.\nHow\u2019s thatpossible?\nHigh-income consumers keep spending like they\u2019ve never heard of thisaffordability crisispeople keep talking about. But middle- and lower-income folks, despite declaring that they\u2019refed up with their financial situations, are still spending, in aggregate. That\u2019s prompting forecasts for flat or even slightly higher retail sales growth over 2024 \u2013 Mastercardforecastsa 3.6% rise in overall holiday spending this year.\nBut those folks are spending more in part because prices are higher. Stubborn inflation, combined with already-high prices, has forced people to shell out more for the holidays, pushing spending numbers up.\n\u201cHoliday shopping is far from full swing, but spending shifts are already surfacing,\u201d said Vicki Hyman, communications director at Mastercard, in a recent report. \u201cInflation is expected to be a larger contributor to sales growth, as opposed to actual sales volume.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why holiday shopping data onBlack Fridayand beyond may give a somewhat rosy picture of the economy, even if headlines fail to expose the ugly side of the economy that has folks so furious.\n\u201cLow-income and high-income households are often living in two different worlds \u2013 and experiencing two different economies,\u201d Joe Wadford, senior economist at Bank of America Institute, told CNN.\nBlack Friday through Christmas will test America\u2019s economic strength. Preliminary reports look good: Early-bird holiday shoppers have been out in strong numbers this year, according to a report earlier this month from Bank of America.\nPaychecks have grown fatter over the decade, and deposits into Bank of America accounts are higher now than they were in 2019, the bank said. That helped fuel a rise in credit and debit card spending overall, which grew 2.4% per household in October 2025 over October 2024, for the best month since February 2024. Spending has risen for five straight months, the bank said.\nShopping for holiday items was up an even stronger 5.7% over the past year in October.\nBut here\u2019s the catch: That spending is measured in dollars, not items. The number of shopping transactions that Bank of America tracks has fallen slightly since January.\nIn other words: Inflation is taking a bite out of Americans\u2019 shopping \u2013 and possibly their gift giving this year.\n\u201cConsumers are clearly spending more and getting less,\u201d Wadford said.\nSome of the spending figures may also be skewed bytariffs.\nAs Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs took shape, Americans rushed to buy items like electronics and jewelry so they could get ahead of the increase in prices. That may ultimately lead to lower spending on those items during the holiday season \u2013 because many people already bought what they wanted or because higher prices may dissuade some folks from making purchases during the holidays.\nAnother problem with aggregate holiday shopping reports is that they rarely tell youwhois doing the shopping. The details tend to paint a less glossy portrait of the economy than some of the headlines suggest.\nFor example, the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes about the economy, showed consumer spending among low- and middle-income consumers is on the decline. They\u2019re increasingly cash-strapped, and they\u2019re looking for more discounts and promotions when they\u2019re shopping.\nMeanwhile, the Fed found high-end consumers are continuing to spend  \u2013 including on luxury items and travel.\nThat trend is starting to show up in holiday spending reports, too: Lower-income Americans have continued to spend \u2013 their credit and debit spending rose 0.7% last month over October 2024, far below annual inflation \u2013 Bank of America reported. But high-income Americans increased spending at more than triple that pace.\nIt\u2019s part of the so-calledK-shaped economy, in which higher earners get a boost from their stock market investments and home valuations and use their fatter paychecks to spend. But lower earners increasinglylive paycheck to paycheckand look for discounts \u2013 or curtail their spending to cope with rising prices.\nThose who make $170,000 and above are still spending like crazy \u2013 with double-digit growth this year, noted Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. But those with more moderate incomes, particularly those with low credit scores, are spending less than they were pre-pandemic.\nBank of America found that wages are only up 1% year-over-year for low-income families. But prices are up 3% as of the September inflation report.\n\u201cWhen your bills are up $300, but your wages are only up $100, what are you going to do?\u201d Wadford said.\nFor those who are under financial stress, the pressure is mounting.\n\u201cIt truly is a bifurcated economy,\u201d American Express CEO Stephen Squeri said on an earnings call with Wall Street analysts last month. Squeri noted that American Express customers tend to spend more money than customers with other credit cards \u2013 which he attributed to the fact that Amex customers tend to be wealthier.\nThat\u2019s similar to executives from other consumer brands, including Target, Walmart, Home Depot, Crocs, Chipotle and Coca-Cola, who all noted some degree of consumer pain among folks who make roughly $100,000 or less \u2013 and robust consumer spending among those who make more.\nIt\u2019s one reason a poll published byFox Newsthis week showed 76% of Americans have a negative view of this economy, up from 67% in July.\n\u201cI would call it a K-shaped economy on steroids this holiday season,\u201d said Long. \u201cIf you look at the gross spending and gross growth, it looks good.

But they remain unnerved about the cost of living and weak hiring","date":"2025-10-10","body":"Persistent worries about the higher cost of living and few job opportunities pushed consumer sentiment down to its seventh-lowest level in October, on records going back to 1952.\nConsumer sentiment edged a hair lower early this month to a preliminary reading of 55, the University of Michigan said Friday \u2014 a weak level rarely seen in the post-World War II era. It\u2019s slightly above the lows it reached this spring when President Donald Trump unveiled massive tariffs.\n\u201cPocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers\u2019 minds,\u201d Joanne Hsu, the survey\u2019s director, said in a release. \u201cConsumers do not expect meaningful improvement in these factors.\u201d\nTheshutdown of the federal government, which stretched into its tenth day on Friday, has not so far affected Americans\u2019 perceptions about the economy, according to the survey. More than a million federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay.\n\u201cInterviews reveal little evidence that the ongoing federal government shutdown has moved consumers\u2019 views of the economy thus far,\u201d Hsu said.\nThe macroeconomic effects of the shutdown aren\u2019t significant, according to economists, but they get bigger the longer it lasts. The next Senate vote to fund the government isscheduled for Tuesday, though Congress appears to remain deadlocked.\nAfter a brief recovery, America\u2019s economic mood began to sour again in recent months on growing frustrations about higher prices and a weakening labor market, according to various surveys. Friday\u2019s survey showed \u201cdeclines in expectations for future personal finances as well as current buying conditions for durables.\u201d\nStill, that may not mean much for the US economy: Sentiment hasn\u2019t been a good predictor of future spending in recent years. In the summer of 2022 when inflation was running at 40-year highs, sentiment plummeted to its lowest level on record, but Americans continued to spend later that year.\nThat dynamic has persisted. Sentiment has been weak this year, but Americans haven\u2019t cut back on their spending. Retail salesincreased in Augustfor the third consecutive month, according to Commerce Department data, rising 0.6% from the prior month.\nEconomists say spending largely hinges on the health of the labor market, which has slowed recently, but remains fairly solid, with unemployment still relatively low. So long as layoffs aren\u2019t surging, Americans will likely continue to spend, despite their economic jitters.\nBut with the federal government shut down, the release of crucial economic statistics has been suspended, including the monthly jobs report, which was scheduled for October 3. However, alternative data by private companies and Federal Reserve regional banks, which aren\u2019t as affected by the shutdown, showed that the labor market continued to slow last month.\n\u201cMany of the themes from September carried into October with the tough job market not inspiring confidence alongside persistent cost-of-living and high interest rate concerns,\u201d Oren Klachkin, financial market economist at Nationwide, wrote in an analyst note Friday.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/10\/economy\/us-consumer-sentiment","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Credit card rewards benefit the rich the most. Here\u2019s who actually pays for them","date":"2025-10-19","body":"Americans arefeeling bleakabout the economy. Yet, despite headwinds, high earners are still spending like mad \u2014 and credit card companies are offering more and more perks to attract them.\nBut some experts are worried these additional rewards for the rich are raising costs for everyone else, from merchants to customers.\n\u201cCredit card companies (are) working to serve the most affluent customers more and more,\u201d said Doug Kantor, general counsel at the trade group National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS). These companies \u201ctry to get (high earners) more rewards at everyone else\u2019s expense by pushing those costs on to everyone.\u201d\nThis year, bothAmerican ExpressandJPMorgan Chaseadded luxury perks to their top rewards cards. For example, the Amex Platinum Card now offers a $200 credit for an Oura ring, while the Chase Sapphire Reserve comes with a credit of up to $500 for high-end hotels;both cardshave many other benefits like access to airport lounges. These new perks were paired with higher annual fees, with the Platinum Card now $895 and the Sapphire Reserve $795.\nHowever, annual fees are only part of how credit card companies provide what they advertise as thousands of dollars in savings for cardholders.\nThese rewards are also funded by the fees that credit card companies charge merchants every timeanycustomer pays with a card. These so-called swipe fees often include items like interchange, processing, and other charges that merchants must pay to credit card companies to accept their cards.\nThe US market has the highest of these rates compared to the rest of the world, \u201cand that\u2019s what\u2019s used to fund these very rich rewards,\u201d said Brian Riley, director of credit advisory services at Javelin Strategy & Research.\nSo, as the rich lean on credit cards with greater rewards, the price merchants pay to accept them has also gone up \u2014 forcing merchants to choose between lower profits or raising their own prices.\nThat\u2019s why even cash payers end up contributing to these elite card rewards. Joanna Stavins, principal economist and policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, found in herresearchthat those who pay with cash and debit effectively \u201csubsidize\u201d credit card users by paying the same prices without reaping the rewards.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely high-income consumers who are more likely to benefit,\u201d said Stavins.\nThere\u2019s a growing divergence in spending between high- and low-income households. In September, credit and debit card spending for high-income households grew more than four times faster than low-income spending, according to data from theBank of America Institute.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a gap, and the gap is widening,\u201d said David Tinsley, the senior economist at the Bank of America Institute.\nAlmost halfof US consumer spending comes from those with incomes in the top 10% \u2014 the highest percentage since at least 1989. And while most low- and middle-income earners prefer paying with cash or debit cards,a majority(51%) of households making more than $150,000 annually prefer credit cards, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2025 findings.\nAs credit card usage rises, so have acceptance fees for merchants. Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic these swipe fees have increased nearly 70%, according to NACS, which cited data from Nilson.\nTo combat this, NACS has lobbied for legislation that aims to promote competition and allow merchants to choose credit card payment networks with lower costs. Despite picking up key supporters when the law was introduced in 2023, such as now-Vice President JD Vance, the legislation hasn\u2019t advanced and observers see little chance of it becoming law in the near-term.\nJavelin Strategy & Research\u2019s Riley said that without such legislation, credit card issuers have doubled down on premium cards that often charge consumers high annual fees and merchants higher fees to accept them \u2014 a lucrative business model in an economy where high earners see the fastest growth in spending and wages.\nAmEx did not comment for this story, but theirfees pagesays they provide \u201csimplified options\u201d for merchants to accept their cards. The company also offers lower rates for some merchants depending on their type of business, the amount of the transaction, and whether they\u2019re in an emerging market.\nChase told CNN that while the Sapphire Reserve Card is designed for \u201caffluent customers who deeply value travel, dining and experiences,\u201dthe company offers several types of credit cardsfor different types of customers.\nSome experts say these swipe fees are necessary for merchants to maintain the advantages of accepting cards.\nTodd Zywicki, a law professor at George Mason University, has advocated against proposals to cap swipe fees, arguing that the growing use of credit cards has benefited merchants and consumers alike \u2014 giving businesses the flexibility to conduct purchases with no need for cash and providing consumers access to credit.\nHe noted swipe fees also support services like fraud prevention, which protect customers from paying for charges when their card is stolen.\nAnd, he said, merchants can certainly choose to refuse card payments if the cost of accepting them is too high.\n\u201cThey want the benefits of accepting credit cards without bearing the cost,\u201d he said.\nHowever, some research shows the divide may not be simply between rich and poor \u2014 but rather, that the benefits from these cards go to those with high credit scores at the expense of those with low credit scores.\nA study published by theInternational Monetary Fundthat looked only at credit card users found those with high credit scores \u2014 including those with low incomes \u2014 benefited from the use of rewards cards. High-income consumers with high credit scores gained the most, while high earners with low credit scores ended up losing out more than any other group, according to the researchers.\nCNN\u2019s Auzinea Bacon contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/19\/business\/premium-credit-cards-wealthy-us-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Consumer sentiment is back to near-record lows. But Americans are still spending. Here\u2019s why","date":"2025-09-26","body":"Americans are souring on the economy again to levels seen rarely in the post-World War II era, raising the question of what it means for spending, economic growth and other key metrics gauging the world\u2019s largest economy.\nConsumer sentiment fell this month to a final reading of 55.1, the University of Michigan said in its latest survey released Friday. The reading was the seventh-lowest on records going back to 1952.\nAmericans are growing pessimistic for the same reason they did so just a few months ago; fears of higher inflation, which could worsen because of President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policy. On Thursday, Trump announced new tariffs ontrucks, furnitureandpharmaceuticals.\nAmericans are now also jittery over the labor market.\n\u201cConsumers continue to express frustration over the persistence of high prices, with 44% spontaneously mentioning that high prices are eroding their personal finances, the highest reading in a year,\u201d said Joanne Hsu, the Michigan survey\u2019s director, in a release.\n\u201cInterviews this month highlight the fact that consumers feel pressure both from the prospect of higher inflation as well as the risk of weaker labor markets,\u201d she added.\nSince the pandemic, sentiment hasn\u2019t been a good predictor of future spending behavior, but the labor market might be.\nIn the summer of 2022 when inflation was raging at four-decade highs and consumer sentiment plunged to its lowest level on record, Americans continued to spend at a solid clip in the following months. And in 2023 when a standoff in Congress prompted sentiment to decline, Americans still splurged throughout that year, namely on concerts and travel.\nAmerican still haven\u2019t reined in their spending: Personal consumption expendituresclimbed 0.6% in Augustfrom the prior month, the Commerce Department said Friday, in the thick of the back-to-school shopping season. After adjusting for inflation, spending rose 0.4% last month.\n\u201cRecent data show consumers resumed spending over the summer, especially those with higher incomes. And why wouldn\u2019t they? Unemployment is still low, nominal wages are still increasing and asset valuations are near all-time highs,\u201d Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said Friday at an event in Washington, DC.\nThe US labor market is slowing, with job growth sputtering and unemployed Americans taking longer to find a job, raising the risk of conditions deteriorating. That was a key reason why the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates last week for the first since December.\nBut unemployment remains low at 4.3% and layoffs haven\u2019t surged, according to Labor Department data. That bodes well for spending in the coming months.\nAmericans with higher incomes continue to power the US economy while low- and middle-income households remain strained by the higher cost of living. That divergence is also becoming evident in sentiment surveys.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the higher-income people in the country who do the majority of the spending, and those are the same people who are more likely to have investments,\u201d Stephanie Guild, chief investment officer at Robinhood, told CNN.\nMajor US stocks indexes have hit record highs repeatedly over the past couple of months, boosted by expectations of Fed rate cuts, continued AI fervor and solid company earnings. On Friday, stocks rose after Trump\u2019s latest tariff announcements, on track to snap a three-day losing streak.\nA resilient stock market is keeping some households with higher incomes from souring like their lower-income counterparts.\n\u201cSentiment for consumers with larger stock holdings held steady in September, while for those with smaller or no holdings, sentiment decreased,\u201d Hsu of the University of Michigan said.\nGuild said that \u201cwith the market at record highs, despite the last few days, I definitely think it makes people feel comfortable about their savings.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/26\/economy\/us-consumer-sentiment-september","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s tariffs are driving a wedge through the US economy, further separating the haves from the have-nots","date":"2025-09-26","body":"Americans ramped up their spending in August; however, their costs of living were on the rise as food and other goods became even more expensive last month and services prices remained stubbornly high.\nNew economic data released Friday showed that consumer spending rose 0.6% in the key back-to-school shopping month of August, and 0.4% when adjusting for inflation. That\u2019sfurther indicationthat a critical driver of the US economy continues to chug along despite broader uncertainty and a slowdown in the labor market.\nHowever, that spending is increasingly being focused on essential purchases, such as health care, at a time when income gains aren\u2019t keeping up.\nAt the same time, some prices \u2014 including those exposed tosteep tariffsimposed by President Donald Trump \u2014 are rising faster than they have in months, according to Commerce Department data released Friday.\n\u201cNot all households are weathering the tariff storm equally,\u201d EY-Parthenon economist Greg Daco wrote in a note to investors on Friday, adding that aggregate consumer spending \u201cgives the appearance of broad-based consumer resilience, but a silent majority is increasingly feeling the strain of higher grocery, furniture, auto, and services prices.\u201d\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures price index \u2014 the inflation gauge the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% target rate \u2014 rose 0.3% on a monthly basis (versus a 0.2% increase in July), which lifted the annual rate to 2.7% from 2.6%, and hitting a six-month high.\nEnergy and gas prices rose in August, and that was a big driver of the monthly increase; however, food prices shot higher as well. Those were up 0.5%, the highest monthly gain since March, and are now up 2.2% from last year.\nWhen excluding food and energy, categories that can be quite volatile, a closely watched gauge of underlying inflation held steady in August. The core PCE price index rose 0.2% in August, the same pace as July, and was unchanged at 2.9%.\nFriday\u2019s data showed that inflation remains well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n\u201cInflation dynamics inside the August PCE report illustrated stubborn service sector inflation that increased from 3.5% to 3.6%, while one can clearly observe rising good prices inside the index with a year ago increase of 13.9% in beef and veal costs along with a 7% increase in household utility costs as well as a 6.2% increase in the cost of electricity all on a year ago basis,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, wrote in a note Friday.\nEconomists were expecting inflation to rise 0.3% from July and to increase to 2.7% annually.\nStocks moved higher on the news. The Dow rose by 200 points, or 0.44%. The S&P 500 gained 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.03%.\nFor the August spending spree, Americans appeared to dip into their savings. Friday\u2019s report showed that the saving rate dropped to 4.6% from 4.8% in July.\nPart of that was because spending gains outpaced income growth for the month. Personal income was up 0.4% and just 0.1%, when accounting for inflation.\nOn an annual basis, inflation-adjusted (or \u201creal\u201d) after-tax personal income is growing 1.9% while real spending is up 2.7%, Commerce Department data shows. Pre-Covid, in September 2019, real disposable income was growing at a3% tick, Commerce Department data shows.\nStill, although the spending trajectory appears strong on the aggregate, the US economy is being increasingly powered by the few: Through the second quarter of this year, the top 20% of earners accounted for roughly half of all spending, Moody\u2019s Analytics data has shown.\nThe Fed just cut rates. But relief might not come quickly enough for some Americans\n\u201cWhile we are encouraged by the 0.4% increase in income growth, the fact that Americans had to draw down savings to support the current pace of spending is a not-so-friendly remainder that the pace of spending is likely driven by upper-end households while lower-income cohorts remain stressed,\u201d Brusuelas wrote.\nThe latest sentiment data from the University of Michigan, also released Friday, showed that Americans\u2019 feelings about the economy remainnear a record low.\n\u201cYou have to go back to the Great Recession to see economic vibes this bad,\u201d Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, wrote Friday. \u201cNotable this month, the decline in sentiment was felt across demographics \u2014 people of most backgrounds are feeling more sour on the current and future economy.\u201d\nOne exception: people with large stock holdings.\n\u201cWealth provides some insulation from perceived economic volatility, and investors have been largely doing OK,\u201d she added.\nThis \u201cK-shaped\u201d environment, economists warn, makes the US economy increasingly vulnerable to shocks.\nAnother potential red flag for the economy is an ongoing shift in the composition of consumer spending.\nRecent months\u2019 data and company earnings reports show that Americans are putting an increasing share of their dollars toward essential areas \u2014 particularly health care, housing and insurance \u2014 as they pull back on other spending, said Adam Josephson, a longtime paper and packaging analyst who publishes a newsletter on consumer spending and other economic trends.\nAs of August, spending on health care accounted for nearly 23% of all consumer spending, Josephson told CNN. And almost half of health care spending is coming from the Medicare and Medicaid side, he added.\n\u201cAs more of people\u2019s wallets go toward mandatory items, the less money they have to spend on discretionary items,\u201d he said in an interview.\nAnd when discretionary spending falters, that could spell trouble for the broader economy.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been seeing it for the past year among all manner of consumer companies, whether it\u2019s [consumer packaged goods] companies, retailers, restaurants, airlines, hotels, you name it, any company that sells something that could reasonably be considered discretionary seems to be having a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these companies that sell to the consumer economy are experiencing growing difficulties, what are they likely to do? They\u2019re likely to contract, cut costs, which means lay people off, shut facilities.\u201d\nJosephson pointed to Starbucks as a prime example.\nThe nation\u2019s largest coffee chain announced plans Thursdayto close 400 underperforming shops nationwide. Although the closures account forbarely 1% of Starbucks\u2019 footprint, the cost-cutting includes the layoffs of roughly 900 employees.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/26\/economy\/us-pce-consumer-spending-inflation-august","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Americans kept spending last month despite elevated inflation","date":"2025-08-29","body":"US consumers kept spending in July, even as inflation remained elevated that month, new data showed Friday.\nConsumer spending rose 0.5% from June, according to Commerce Department data released Friday. That\u2019s slightly below expectations for a 0.6% bump but represented a slight pickup from the0.4% increase notched in June, according to FactSet consensus estimates.\nJuly is typically a month filled with summer sales events, notably Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, as well as a key month for back-to-school spending. However, spending on cars and financial services (bolstered by the strong stock market performance) drove the lion\u2019s share of last month\u2019s spending gains, Friday\u2019s report showed.\nWhen factoring in inflation, spending rose 0.3% last month, an acceleration from a tepid 0.1% gain in June.\n\u201cConsumer spending is solid, and goods inflation remains moderate for now as the tariff war has yet to slow the economy appreciably or lead to a worrisome outbreak of inflation that could worry markets,\u201d Chris Rupkey, FwdBonds chief economist, wrote Friday in a note to investors.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures price index \u2014 the inflation gauge the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% target rate \u2014 rose 0.2% on a monthly basis, which kept the annual rate at 2.6%.\nThe core PCE price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories and is considered a better indicator of underlying inflation trends, rose 0.3% from June (matching the pace seen the prior month) and saw its annual rate accelerate to 2.9% from 2.8%.\nStocks were lower Friday morning but pared some losses after the data release. Dow futures were down 100 points, or 0.21%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.23% and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.44%.\nThe July inflation data was right in line with what economists had expected.\nSolid income growth helped to provide fuel for resilient US consumers, whose spending powers more than two-thirds of America\u2019s economic activity.\nPersonal income rose by 0.4% last month (marking an acceleration from 0.3% in June), a reflection of higher wage gains, the report showed. The savings rate held steady at 4.4% last month.\nWhile both spending and income rebounded last month, July also marked the first month since March when monthly spending exceeded income, noted Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\u201cThis is an encouraging sign that American consumers are still willing to open their wallets when they see deals,\u201d she wrote.\nAnd, in July, the appetite for spending was largely directed in the area of durable goods \u2014 products like appliances, cars and the like are that are meant to last for several years.\nAuto-related purchases played a key role in the durable goods rebound; however, real (inflation-adjusted) spending also picked up modestly in categories such as furnishings and other home equipment as well as recreational goods and vehicles.\nJuly marked the biggest monthly increase in durable goods since Americans\u2019 pre-tariff spending spree in March, noted Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein on Friday.\n\u201cSpending on these big-ticket items was flattish in April before posting back-to-back declines in May and June, raising concerns about the tariff impact on durable goods spending,\u201d they wrote in a note posted Friday. \u201cThose worries may fade a bit after today\u2019s report showed durable goods spending rebounded in July rising 1.9% in the month.\u201d\nHowever, they also noted that Friday\u2019s report included a continuation of another trend showing how tariffs are starting to weigh on consumers: They\u2019re pulling back on discretionary spending.\nRecreational services spending posted the smallest monthly gain of any services category, and spending at hotels and restaurants fell last month, they noted.\nThe inflation trajectory outlined in Friday\u2019s Personal Income and Outlays report mirrors that of what was seen in the closely watched Consumer Price Index as well as the Producer Price Index.\nPrices are rising more than they typically should (and more than desired by the Fed), andbusinesses are slowly starting to pass along higher tariff coststo the end consumer.\n\u201cThe real hit (from tariffs) is in the next six months,\u201d Navy Federal Credit Union economist Long told CNN in an interview Friday. \u201cThe reason it\u2019s been so slow is the middle class doesn\u2019t have extra room in their budgets to absorb higher costs.\u201d\nSmall businesses are scrambling as US tariff exemption comes to an end\nThis is a different environment than 2022, when households were quite a bit more flush from the extra savings they built up during the pandemic and the stimulus payments received during that time, she said.\n\u201cA lot of brands and retailers and restaurants were shocked that they could keep raising prices, and people were not pushing back,\u201d Long said. \u201cNow, consumers are pushing back, and that\u2019s a big part of the story of why, even at this point as the inventories run down, we\u2019re seeing a more muted pass-through of the tariffs.\u201d\nThe tariff-driven price increases were expected to be a slow boil: US businesses loaded up their warehouses prior to the tariffs going into effect; many of the announced tariffs were delayed, reduced or contained many product exemptions; companies along the supply chain are letting their profit margins eat some of the costs; and other tariffs are still going into effect.\nTariffs weren\u2019t expected to drastically reaccelerate overall inflation \u2014 but the pace of price hikes remaining elevated for the coming year could present some challenges of their own for the economy, Long said.\n\u201cThe United States is entering a stagflation-lite period,\u201d she said, noting an economic environment with high inflation,stagnant economic growth and rising unemployment.\nThe concern moving forward, Long said, is that the higher costs will lead to cost-cutting efforts by businesses.\n\u201cI do agree that the Federal Reserve needs to cut in September and needs to cut again in December, because while there\u2019s not an inflation crisis brewing, there is a lot of potential for a layoff crisis to start,\u201d she said.\nCNN\u2019s John Towfighi contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/08\/29\/economy\/us-pce-consumer-spending-inflation-july","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Clean energy savings are disappearing. Here\u2019s how to get them","date":"2025-08-14","body":"Time is running out for US consumers to get money back for rooftop solar installations, electric vehicles, energy efficient appliances and more after President Donald Trump and Republicansslashed clean energyout of the tax code last month.\nAnd the potential savings are steep.\nThe federal tax credit alone takes $9,000 off the cost of rooftop solar for the average customer, according to estimates from EnergySage, an online marketplace that connects customers to solar installers in their area.\nConsumer interest in tax credits spiked soon after Trump signedthe spending billinto law.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an all time high in customer inquiries over the past month, so demand is up significantly,\u201d Emily Walker, director of insights at EnergySage, told CNN. The marketplace saw a 205% year-over-year increase in homeowners working with contractors to get solar panels on their roofs, in some cases adding batteries as well.\nBut if consumers want to take advantage of tax credits, especially for solar, batteries, heat pumps and home insulation, they need to act quickly, Walker said.\n\u201cInstallations don\u2019t happen overnight and in order to claim the tax credit, the system does have to be completed by the end of this year,\u201d she added.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very compressed timeline, which is why our advice to homeowners right now is to get quotes, start the process right now, or you could miss out.\u201d\nSome states are trying to get the word out as well. The Colorado Public Utilities Commission recentlypublished a websitedetailing all state and federal consumer rebates for clean energy, putting the information in a central location. They had 1,400 visitors to the site in just the first few days, said commission director Rebecca White, and plan to do in-person outreach to communities soon.\n\u201cWhat we want is for people to take advantage of what they\u2019re eligible for,\u201d White said. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in lowering your bill, electrifying your home, moving to an electric vehicle, there is just a ton out there and some of it does go away at the end of the year.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what you need to know while there\u2019s still time to jump on savings.\nThere is an income limit for this tax credit \u2013 see more informationhereon who qualifies.\nElectric vehicle tax credits expire soonest; consumers will need to buy a vehicle by September 30 in order to receive $7,500 off a new EV (see which models qualifyhere), or $4,000 off a qualifying used EV. It\u2019s the shortest timeline, but these are also the easiest credits to get as they\u2019re automatically deducted from the vehicle\u2019s sticker price, rather than through a tax break the following year.\nIn Colorado, the state with the most EV sales in the country, about 60,000 vehicles are being sold per year, said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. Toor said the state doesn\u2019t track how many vehicles were bought with the federal tax credit discount, but he expects most of them are.\nSome dealerships in Colorado are advertising the closing window to get the tax credits with a countdown clock on their websites, Toor said.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been thinking about buying an electric vehicle, it is likely that the best deals you\u2019re going to get for a while will be between now and September 30, so it is time to pull the trigger and buy that vehicle,\u201d he said.\nToor said that while he\u2019s concerned about the end of federal tax credits, \u201cthey\u2019re pretty clearly the vehicles of the future, and it\u2019s pretty clearly where the global automotive industry is going.\u201d\nGoes towards rooftop solar, battery panels, solar water heaters, geothermal heat pumps, small wind turbines and more. There is no income cap for this tax credit.\nThis tax credit helps cover 30% of the cost ofclean energy that generates powerfor your home or feed into a utility\u2019s net metering program. Importantly, in order to qualify for the tax credit under the GOP tax bill\u2019s new timeline, the system must be installed by the end of the year.\nIt takes around two to three months to put solar on your roof, Walker said.\nHowever, there is more homeowner legwork needed when preparing to install solar panels. The most important place for homeowners to start is by researching costs in their area and getting multiple quotes from contractors, Walker said.\n\u201cYou want to make sure that you\u2019re not paying more for solar right now, which would negate the benefit of receiving the tax credit,\u201d she said.\nGoes toward energy efficient appliances such as heat pumps, water heaters and boilers, biomass stoves, home insulation, better insulated windows and doors. There is no income cap for this tax credit.\nThis tax credit gives homeowners up to $3,200 each year to help cover the cost of these appliances or insulation upgrades. Homeowners can also use the tax credit to pay for an energy audit to see where their homes are wasting energy and how to make them more efficient.\nFederal data released last year showed most people were using this credit to help pay to better insulate their homes.\n\u201cIf you have that furnace in your basement that you know is near the end of its useful life, this is the moment to not wait for that thing to go out in the middle of the winter,\u201d said Zach Pierce, head of policy at the home electrification nonprofit Rewiring America. \u201cGet that process moving so that you can get on that schedule before the end of the year.\u201d\nSome electric vehicle buyers have more time to claim a tax credit to help pay for buying and installing a charger in their homes.\nThis credit pays for 30% of the cost of a home EV charger, up to $1,000, but only applies to consumers in census-designated low income communities.\nAmerica was already losing to China on clean energy.

{"title":"Consumer spending heated up a bit last month \u2013 but so did inflation","date":"2025-07-31","body":"US consumers continued to spend in June, powering the economy in the process, despite tariff-related price hikesbecoming more present on store shelves and online.\nConsumer spendingrose 0.3% from May, when spending was flat, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday. Adjusted for inflation, spending ticked up 0.1%.\nThe report \u2014 which provides a comprehensive look on how prices are changing as well as how households\u2019 income, spending and savings are faring \u2014 showed that inflation picked up as well last month.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures price index \u2014 the inflation gauge the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% target rate \u2014 rose 0.3% on a monthly basis, which lifted the annual rate to 2.6%, the highest since February.\nTariffs are starting to leave a bigger mark on overall inflation; however, consumers, whose spending powers more than two-thirds of economic activity, are largely \u201cholding up OK,\u201d Gus Faucher, chief economist of The PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN in an interview.\nPersonal income rose 0.3% in June and the savings rate held steady at 4.5%, Thursday\u2019s report showed.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re seeing modest growth in consumer spending,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy has definitely downshifted over the past year; we\u2019re seeing slower job growth, slower income growth and along with that is coming slower consumer spending growth.\u201d\n\u201cYou add on top of that, tariffs \u2014 both the price increases and the uncertainty that\u2019s created \u2014 and consumers have turned a bit more cautious,\u201d he added.\nEconomists were expecting PCE to rise 0.3% from 0.2% in May and accelerate on an annual basis to 2.5% from the initially reported 2.3% increase (May\u2019s annual inflation rate was revised upward to 2.4% in Thursday\u2019s report).\nExcluding energy and food, which tend to be quite volatile, the \u201ccore\u201d PCE index showed price hikes picked up speed in June, rising 0.3% from May (the fastest gain in four months), and holding at an annual rate of 2.8%\nThe PCE price index was expected to heat up slightly in part because of rising gas prices, which had been falling for much of the year, as well as pricier goods from businesses passing along tariff-related costs to consumers.\nThat was indeed the case, according to Thursday\u2019s report: Energy prices shot up 0.9% after falling 1% the month before. Goods prices rose 0.4% (durable up 0.5%, non-durable goods up 0.4%), marking the highest monthly rate since January when prices bumped higher after holiday season discounts.\n\u201cDurable goods prices were up a half of a percent,\u201d Faucher said. \u201cThese things can bounce around form month to month, and I don\u2019t want to read too much into everything; but, certainly, that\u2019s suggestive of tariff costs being passed along to consumers, and I think we\u2019re going to see more of that over the next few months.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies, which include widespread (but highly volatile) tariffs on imported goods from countries around the world, are starting to result in higher prices for consumers as well as elevated inflation rates.\nThe tariffs are paidby the companies that import the goods, but then those price increases are often spread out through the supply chain and, oftentimes, passed onto consumers in some form.\nAnd while the higher tariffs aren\u2019t expected to trigger an inflationary surge like Americans saw in 2022, the price hikes won\u2019t be easy for everyone, Faucher said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be uncomfortable for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that they\u2019re going to start to see it, and they\u2019re going to notice that their paychecks aren\u2019t going as far as they were.\u201d\nStock futures were relatively unchanged after the latest spending and inflation data. Dow futures were up 100 points, or 0.23%. S&P 500 futures rose 0.92% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 1.33%.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.\nCNN\u2019s John Towfighi contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/31\/economy\/us-pce-consumer-spending-inflation-june","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

But President Donald Trump\u2019s tumultuous trade war drove her to buy a car this past April, fearing higher prices if she waited any longer.\nNow Wilburn has a $607 monthly car payment coming out of her $1,600 Social Security check, which she said is her only source of income.\n\u201cThings are so tight right now,\u201d Wilburn told CNN. \u201cBut the car was a necessity because of my oldest son\u2019s medical appointments.\u201d\nAs Trump waged a global trade war this past spring, many Americans raced to make major purchases \u2014 cars, electronics and furniture \u2014 trying to beat any potential price hikes caused by tariffs. That spending spree has left many with new debt and could weigh on consumer spending, which powers the US economy, in the months ahead.\nRetail sales surged in Marchas consumers drove up car sales, spurred on by tariffs targeting imported cars and auto parts, which went into effect in April and May, respectively.But those numbers have weakened since then, according to Commerce Department data, declining 0.9% in May in the steepest monthly decline in two years.\nMeanwhile, US household debt reached $18.2 trillion in the first three months of the year, a record high on data going back to 2004, as delinquencies marched higher, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nFor families like Wilburn\u2019s, the spring\u2019s spending spree was a gamble against uncertainty \u2014a bet that may now require years of careful budgeting to manage.\n\u201cOnce I get everything level again, hopefully it will get easier, but I don\u2019t know,\u201d Wilburn said. \u201cNow we can\u2019t really do anything for our enjoyment, like buy bird food for all the birds in the backyard.\u201d\nAmericans who are now saddled with new debt may pull back on their purchases. Economists say \u201cdiscretionary spending\u201d \u2014 purchases that are not necessary for one\u2019s survival \u2014 is usually first on the chopping block. That includes eating out and traveling for leisure.\nABankrate surveyof consumers\u2019 plans for discretionary spending showed that 54% of US adults said they expect to spend less on travel, dining out or entertainment this year, up from 49% who said the same last year. In May, retail spending at restaurants and bars fell 0.9%, the Commerce Department said, the first monthly decline since February and the steepest one since February 2023.\nAnnika Wheelock, 28, and her family used a loan and a home equity line of credit to accelerate spending on more than $137,000 in purchases \u2014 including a new car, computers, a refrigerator and home repairs \u2013 to avoid any sticker shock from Trump\u2019s tariffs. With her husband returning to school this fall and their retirement contributions slashed, Wheelock, who works as a nurse, says her family is now living paycheck to paycheck.\n\u201cAfter making all these purchases, we\u2019re hunkering down and not planning on spending that much money, like we\u2019re not planning on going out and putting money back into the economy anytime soon,\u201d she said.\nIn March, aCreditKarma surveyof more than 2,000 US adults showed that 51% of them said they changed their spending behavior in anticipation of Trump\u2019s tariffs, with 18% specifically saying the pulled forward major purchases.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs are widely expected to eventually weigh on Americans through higher inflation, even those who front-loaded their big-ticket purchases. That means consumers who took part in the spring spending spree are left even more financially vulnerable.\nHenry Tuason, a 52-year-old school photographer from Los Angeles, said he spent nearly $50,000 earlier this year on a new laptop, television and a $45,000 Hyundai Tucson Hybrid to get ahead of the tariffs\u2019 impact. He said he\u2019s been on edge these days, worried his family could suddenly deal with an unexpected hardship.\n\u201cOne day, when I went to go pick (my wife) up from work, people were driving very badly and I told her how picking her up is stressing me out because of this brand new car,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s gone back to taking the bus because to crash it prematurely would be very bad.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s not just being prepared for emergencies. If more Americans find themselves without a job or dealing with any financial hardship, that would further trigger a pullback in spending.\n\u201cAnytime you lose a job is bad, but it\u2019d be much worse if me or my wife did nowadays, after everything we bought,\u201d Tuason said.\nThe unemployment rate remains at a low 4.2% for the third consecutive month in a row and employers are still demonstrating an appetite to hire. On Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that job openings unexpectedly rose in May to 7.7 million. However, entry-level hiring is down and Trump\u2019s chaotic trade war paralyzed some business decision-making.\nFor now, Wall Street and economic policymakers are watching closely whether spending plummets after households stretched themselves to beat Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\u201cAs the tariffs kick in with price increases finally taking effect, that will be a hit to people\u2019s real income, their purchasing power, and because of that, you will see a slowing in consumer spending,\u201d Jay Bryson, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief economist, told CNN. \u201cAnd that will also be because of that pull-forward in spending.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/02\/business\/us-spending-debt-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Americans reined in their spending last month","date":"2025-06-27","body":"The US economic engine sputtered in May: Consumer spending declined for the first time since January, according to new data released Friday that also showed inflation heated up on an annual basis.\nThe Commerce Department report showed that consumer spending fell 0.1% last month after rising 0.2% in April. When taking inflation into account, spending declined by 0.3% for the month.\nA nearly 50% drop-off in motor vehicle sales was a significant driver of the May spending retreat as consumersrushed to dealerships to buy carsin March and April, fearing that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs would send those costs soaring.\nHowever, Friday\u2019s report also showed that consumers pulled back on spending at restaurants and hotels.\nConsumer spending powers more than two-thirds of US economic activity, and economists have expressed concern that the steep tariffs on most imported goods \u2014 and, especially, the mounting uncertainty of how Trump\u2019s trade policy could affect the economy \u2014 will erode Americans\u2019 resiliency.\n\u201cApart from autos, households are also shelling out less for services (notably restaurant meals), with volumes flat in May after little rise in April,\u201d Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO, wrote in a note Friday. \u201cThis could reflect some anxiety about the trade war.\u201d\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures price index was 2.3% for the 12 months ended in May, versus 2.2% in April. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.1%, unchanged fromApril.\nEconomists were expecting the PCE price index to rise 0.1% from April, resulting in the annual rate ticking up to 2.3%. They expected spending to pick up slightly to 0.3%, according to FactSet.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy categories, the core PCE price index rose 0.2% from April and ticked up to 2.7% on an annual basis.\nTrump\u2019s broad (and fluctuating) slew of tariffs have yet to cause a noticeable jump in inflation, but that\u2019s to be expected.\nAmong the key reasons for that: Economic data is lagged; there have been significant shifts in tariff policy, and some of the most aggressive duties were curtailed, paused or lessened; businesses front-loaded purchases, building up their pre-tariff inventory and offering up discounts to keep from alienating customers; and some costs from the initial waves of new tariffs might have been absorbed by retailers and manufacturers.\nSome categories, such as home furnishings and toys, are starting to reflect higher prices, and those increases are likely the tip of the iceberg.\n\u201cThe conclusion is that, essentially, there is more to come, and it will be a larger shock,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN in an interview.\nHigher prices are expected to hit in the coming months, but only after pre-tariff inventories are depleted, Oren Klachkin, Nationwide Financial Markets economist, wrote in a note to investors.\nBut progress on trade agreements could lessen the blow, he wrote, noting news Thursday that the White House and China signed a deal.\n\u201cThe US-China trade news yesterday is ostensibly encouraging as it suggests the threat of April tariff levels is now off the table,\u201d Klachkin wrote.\nStill, he cautioned, there\u2019s too much up in the air on the trade front for the Federal Reserve\u2019s liking.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect any rate cuts over the summer but see [three-quarter-points\u2019 worth] of easing by year-end after evidence of a weaker labor market emerges,\u201d he wrote.\nA slew of critical labor market data will be released next week, with the June jobs report due out Thursday, because of the July 4 holiday. Economists are expecting the report will show a continued cooldown in labor market conditions, with job gains slowing to 125,000 and the unemployment rate potentially rising to 4.3%, early forecasts from FactSet show.\nPersonal income fell more than expected for the month, sinking 0.4%; however, the May decline was largely a reflection of Social Security payments returning to more typical levels. In March and April, former public workers received large retroactive payments made under the Social Security Fairness Act for reduced benefits under prior legislation.\nDespite the recent months\u2019 volatility in those income numbers, the trend is one where income growth \u201cremains quite subdued,\u201d Daco said.\n\u201cReal disposable income (what\u2019s left after taxes) is currently trending at a pace of 1.7% year over year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will bring down consumer spending from the 3% (annual) pace that we were accustomed to through most of 2024 closer to 1.5% over the coming months and perhaps even below 1% in the back half of 2025.\u201d\nThe closer spending growth gets to 1%, the more vulnerable the US economy becomes, he cautioned.\n\u201cYou\u2019re much more subject to a stalling,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re exposed to price shocks, oil prices shocks, tariff shocks, interest rate shocks, stock market shocks, and therefore you\u2019re more at risks of experiencing a more significant slowdown or possibly a recession.\u201d\nAnd, by and large, consumers are ill-equipped to weather any kind of economic storm, said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet.\n\u201cA rush of federal dollars helped the economy recover from the fastest (and one of the deepest) recessions in history, contributing to high price growth that households were largely able to absorb,\u201d Renter wrote in a note on Friday. \u201cNow, debt levels are climbing, savings are spent down, and consumers are simply more vulnerable.\u201d\nIn May, the personal saving rate fell to 4.5% after jumping higher in April, a month that saw the Social Security payments surge.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/27\/economy\/us-pce-consumer-spending-inflation-may","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Consumer confidence improves for the first time since November","date":"2025-05-27","body":"It\u2019s been a little while since Americans had an inkling of optimism about the economy.\nConsumer confidence rose 12.3 points this month to a reading of 98, the Conference Board said in its latest survey released Tuesday, the first monthly gain since November and the biggest monthly increase since March 2021. That\u2019s higher than economists\u2019 expectations for a reading of 88, according to data firm FactSet.\nFor the past several months, President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping policy changes, including his ongoing trade war, have taken a toll on people\u2019s attitudes toward the economy. Last month, consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the early days of the Covid pandemic.\nBut progress in Trump\u2019s negotiations with other countries over trade gave Americans a sense of hope this month.\nRelated articleBeijing sees a \u2018victory\u2019 with the US tariffs truce. What\u2019s it aiming for next?\n\u201cThe rebound was already visible before the May 12 US-China trade deal but gained momentum afterwards,\u201d Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at the Conference Board, said in a release. \u201cThe monthly improvement was largely driven by consumer expectations as all three components of the Expectations Index \u2014 business conditions, employment prospects, and future income \u2014 rose from their April lows.\u201d\nStill, economic jitters persist and Trump still has more than a hundred trade deals to hash out by early July, when his reciprocal tariffs are slated to go back into effect, if countries haven\u2019t negotiated a trade deal with the US. So, uncertainty is still very much elevated, which raises the question of what it means for consumer spending, which powers two-thirds of the US economy.\n\u201cConsumer confidence may have soared, and Americans have reason to be happy given the rollback in tariffs, especially with China,\u201d said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in commentary issued Tuesday. \u201cBut when prices start rising from existing tariffs in a month or two, it will be a sobering reminder that a new inflation fight has just begun.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s trade war is still in flux, but some countries have signaled they\u2019re willing to cooperate and potentially strike a full trade deal.\nThe first country was the United Kingdom on May 8, which didn\u2019t announce an actual trade deal, but rather a concept of a framework, with some details that were agreed upon, such as car imports from the UK being taxed at a reduced rate.\nThen on May 12 in Geneva, China and the United States agreed to drastically roll back tariffs on each other\u2019s goods for an initial 90-day period, in a surprise breakthrough between two countries that were engaged in a worsening tit-for-tat trade war.\nBut any potential US-China trade deal still has a rocky path ahead. Last week, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said the US was \u201cundermining\u201d the Geneva talks after the Trump administration warned companies against usingAI chipsmade by national tech champion Huawei. Beijing has alsoscoffed at Trump\u2019s demandthat China work to prevent the flow of fentanyl into the US, saying that it\u2019s the \u201cUS\u2019s problem, not China\u2019s.\u201d\nThe European Union on Sunday said it\u2019s willing to fast-track trade talks with the US, prompting Trump to delay the 50% tariff on EU imports he threatened last week until July 9. Trump said he and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had a \u201cvery nice call\u201d that led to the pause.\n\u201c(Von der Leyen) said she wants to get down to serious negotiation,\u201d Trump told reporters at Morristown Municipal Airport in New Jersey. \u201cJuly 9 would be the day, that was the date she requested. Could we move it from June 1 to July 9? I agreed to do that.\u201d\nConsumer confidence may potentially be starting to recover, but Trump\u2019s trade war is far from over. That leaves Wall Street and the Federal Reserve to keep a close eye on whether consumer demand remains in positive territory or fall off a cliff in the face of lingering uncertainty.\nRelated articleAs Trump reignites a trade war and faces a bond market revolt, the economy is about to go through the wringer this week\nIt\u2019s been somewhat difficult to assess the true health of consumer spending lately. Over the past few months, Americans have pulled forward purchases, particularly of cars, to beat Trump\u2019s tariffs. That has skewed crucial economic data, such as retail sales. Will consumers continue to spend after these brief buying sprints?\nA key gauge of underlying demand in the economy \u2014 referred to as final sales to private domestic purchasers \u2014 accelerated to 3% in the first quarter from 2.9% in the fourth quarter. All eyes will be on that figure for the second quarter, when it is reported in July.\nThis Friday, the Commerce Department is set to release April data on household spending, income and the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.

{"title":"How Trump\u2019s megabill transfers wealth in the US","date":"2025-05-24","body":"A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nIt took intense lobbying from President Donald Trump, an all-nighter, and a vote on a bill for which many people did not yet have a clear grasp of the final changes, but House Republicans got it done this week. They passed their version of the \u201cone big, beautiful bill,\u201d a behemoth that pairs tax cuts with new provisions that will push people off Medicaid and food assistance.\nLow-income Americans will feel the effect of changes to aid programs, while the wealthy will see most of the windfall from tax cuts, according to multiple assessments.\nDemocrats argue the trade-off is cruel, but Republicans say it\u2019s necessary to deliver on Trump\u2019s economic agenda and to root out waste and fraud, protecting the programs for those who need them.\nWhat the House passed is an opening bid as the process now shifts to the US Senate, which must pass its own version of a tax and spending bill.\nSenators will be gauging the public reaction to the House bill and what critics have said is a reverse transfer of wealth, much of which will be put on the nation\u2019s credit card in the form of deficit spending.\nHere\u2019s a look at how the \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d takes benefits from lower-income Americans in order to cut taxes, primarily for the wealthy.\nHow much does the bill cut in taxes? How much does it cut in spending?\nThe House\u2019stax and spending cuts packageis certainly a \u201cbig\u201d bill in terms of its impact. We don\u2019t have all the final figures yet because the Congressional Budget Office is still working on the analysis of the final version of the bill, which contained some significant last-minute changes.\nButCBO\u2019s initial estimatesfound that the package\u2019s tax measures would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over a decade, while other provisions would cut nearly $1 trillion in federal support forMedicaid and food stampsover that period.\nMedicaid, which provides health insurance to low-income Americans, would face the largest cuts in the package, with CBO projecting a nearly $700 billion reduction in federal spending. Meanwhile, food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would face a $267 billion cut in federal support.\nThe bill would also increase spending for defense, immigration enforcement and homeland security, while pulling back on federal spending in some other areas.\nThe national debt is more than $37 trillion. How much would this bill add to that incredible figure?\nOverall, the bill would add $3.1 trillion to the nation\u2019s debt, including interest, over the next decade, according to anearly independent analysisfrom the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nWe are still waiting for the final word from CBO.\nLong-term budget projections are notoriously difficult, and House Republicans were altering the provisions up until just before they passed the bill. Plus, things could change when senators start working on their version.\nMost of the tax cuts in the bill aren\u2019t exactly cuts, but rather extensions of tax cuts from Trump\u2019s first term. Will most Americans see their tax bill go down if something like this bill becomes law?\nCurrently, if Congress doesn\u2019t act, most Americans would see their taxes increase because the individual income tax cuts from the 2017 bill are set to expire at the end of this year. The House package would make permanent essentially all of those provisions.\nHowever, many people may not notice that aspect of the legislation since \u201call it\u2019s going to do is extend the tax system that they\u2019ve come to know and hate,\u201d said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\nBut here\u2019s the impact the bill would have compared with Congress doing nothing: On average, the majority of Americans would see a tax cut next year \u2014 more than 80%, in fact, according tothe center\u2019s analysisof the tax provisions. The average household would see their federal taxes drop by about $2,900.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t include the impact of the spending cuts, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute.\nWhat do we know about how much goes to wealthier taxpayers and how much goes to middle-class and lower-wage taxpayers?\nHigher-income taxpayers would come out ahead, with 60% of the tax cuts going to the top 20%, who have incomes of at least $217,000, next year and more than a third going to the top 5%, or those who earn $460,000 or more, according to the center.\nThe following numbers show how the rich would get the biggest boost in their after-tax income compared to others.\nThose in the top 20% would see an average tax cut of $12,660 next year, increasing their after-tax income by 3.4%. But again, that\u2019s compared with current law, in which Trump\u2019s first-term tax cuts are expiring.\nMiddle-income earners, those making between about $67,000 and $119,000, would get a tax break of $1,840, bumping up their after-tax income by 2.4%, while those in the lowest bracket, who earn less than about $35,000, would get a tax cut of $160, nudging up their after-tax income by 0.8%.\nIndividual circumstances will also play a major role, since the tax package provides targeted breaks for certain groups. For instance, because of the temporary elimination of taxes on tips and overtime, those who receive those types of compensation could see more tax relief than other workers making the same income.\nThere\u2019s an important reason Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts now need to be extended. In 2017, lawmakers were able to make it appear like the tax cuts would have less of a long-term effect on the deficit and national debt by making them temporary. They bet, correctly, that this year\u2019s Congress would prioritize either extending the tax cuts or making them permanent. Are there any similar accounting tricks in this bill?\nThere certainly are! House Republicans included many of Trump\u2019s campaign promises in the bill but made them temporary to reduce their cost.\nThe elimination of taxes on tips and overtime would be in effect from 2025 through 2028, as would be the $4,000 boost in the standard deduction for senior citizens, which aims to fulfill Trump\u2019s promise to end taxes on Social Security benefits. Plus, the deduction of up to $10,000 in interest on certain car loans also expires after 2028.\nSeveral of the package\u2019s business tax measures \u2014 which are factored into the tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans \u2014 are also temporary. That\u2019s one reason why the bill is not as advantageous to the super-rich in later years.\nSeparately \u2014 and this is not a matter of accounting, but rather of politics \u2014 new work requirements for Medicaid, which are expected to push millions of people out of the program and likely leave them uninsured, wouldn\u2019t kick in until the end of 2026, which is notably after the midterm election. However, states would have the option of implementing the mandate earlier in the year.\nMaking all the temporary individual and business tax provisions permanent would add $5.1 trillion to the nation\u2019s debt, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\u2019s early analysis.\nThe bill partially offsets tax cuts by slashing Medicaid coverage and food stamps. How does that factor into the impact the bill will have on the country?\nThis is key to understanding the bill\u2019s overall effect on Americans\u2019 wallets, particularly on those who are lower on the income ladder.\nThe deep spending cuts to Medicaid and food stamps will result in millions of people losing access to their health insurance and food assistance, leaving them far worse off financially. The measures, particularly introducing work requirements to Medicaid and expanding them in the food stamps program, will not only be felt by the low-income adults that the Republicans are targeting, but also children, senior citizens, people with disabilities and others, experts say.\nThePenn Wharton Budget Modelcrunched the numbers, taking into consideration both the tax cuts and spending reductions on Medicaid and food stamps, as well as the changes to the federal student loan program, which aim to limit the federal role in student borrowing.\nIt found that the lowest-income Americans, making up to about $17,000, would see their incomes fall by $820, on average, next year \u2013 after taking into account taxes and certain government benefits. That\u2019s a drop of 14.6%, on average.\nThe next group, with incomes between $17,000 and $51,000, would lose $430 in income, or 1.1%, on average.\nMiddle-income households would fare better, receiving a tax break of $840, or a 1.1% gain in income, on average. These taxpayers have incomes between $51,000 and $93,000.\nBut the highest earners, those making more than $174,000, would enjoy bigger income boosts, of just over $12,000, or 2.6%, on average.\n\u201cFor lower income people, what they are losing in Medicaid, Affordable Care Act premium support and food stamps more than dominates any type of benefits from taxes on tips and other tax cuts,\u201d said Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not going to make it back through economic growth.\u201d\nThis bill is probably unlikely to pass the Senate in its current form. What do we know, if anything, about how Senate Republicans might change it?\nChanges seem like a certainty. This bill is being passed under a budget reconciliation process that allows Republicans a way around filibuster rules. That means they can make their megabill law with only Republican votes in the Senate, although they only have three votes to spare with Vice President JD Vance\u2019s tie-breaking vote. Some GOP senators wantmore spending cuts. Others are worried about the Medicaid changes. One wants a more generous tax credit for children. Plus, non-budget-related items could be stripped by the Senate parliamentarian. Assuming something ultimately passes the Senate, it would then have to go back to the House. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson have shown an ability to get things over the finish line. But this will be a major legislative test for new Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\nDespite the cuts, the bill still adds to the national debt. Is there any active talk across party lines about how to deal with Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security spending, which the government says are unsustainable?\nThe short answer is no. The bill we\u2019re talking about right now has more tax cuts than spending cuts, which is why it adds to the deficit. The things driving deficit spending are the growth in Medicare and Social Security as baby boomers age. Bothprograms\u2019 trust fundscould run out of the money they need to pay full benefits in a decade or so. Yet neither party is making reform of those programs a top priority, in large part because touching them is politically toxic. Solutions would probably have to be bipartisan. There are plenty of known solutions \u2014 things like incremental changes to the retirement age or payroll tax hikes on higher wage earners \u2014 but those are not currently being seriously debated. On Medicaid, the GOP answer is the cuts in the bill, but it\u2019s paired with much larger tax cuts.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/24\/politics\/house-tax-spending-cuts-bill-explained","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Already racked by economic uncertainty, consumers who bought big-ticket items now have to pay a hefty bill or take a hit to their savings.\nOn top of that, it\u2019s gotten more difficult to find a job, credit accounts that are newly delinquent are rising, and Trump\u2019s volatile trade war could deliver a double whammy of stagnant economic growth and rising inflation \u2014 a destructive combination known as \u201cstagflation.\u201d\nSo if the expectation is that Trump\u2019s tariffs are going to jack up prices, it could make sense to forward a purchase to avoid sticker shock, as many Americans did earlier in the spring,according to Commerce Department data.

The survey of 2,500 adults sought to evaluate their personal financial situations as well as how they were adapting to changing forces in the economy, including new tariffs, the rise of generative artificial intelligence and the role of higher education.\nThe survey was conducted between April 3 and April 23 \u2014 a period that followed Trump\u2019sApril 2 announcementof a new slew of massive tariffs and alater pause of dozens of those tariffs. The survey period was before the recentde-escalation of the US and China trade war.\nSurvey respondents indicated plans to hold off on some major purchases and scale back in other areas of their lives in order to not accumulate debt, according to KPMG.\n\u201cSeeing them go through the Covid cycle and into this new cycle, they\u2019re quickly adapting to their spend-smart initiatives as they look at their personal finances and ways to control costs and how they evaluate major purchasing decisions,\u201d Matt Kramer, KPMG\u2019s US products line of business leader, told CNN in an interview.\n\u201cI think it took a little bit long the last cycle (the pandemic) where they just weren\u2019t quite used to making those major adjustments, and maybe the cost of money was a little bit cheaper back then,\u201d he said.\nBut now, consumers appear to be signaling they havelittle appetite to incur new debtand are hunkering down more quickly.\nAbout 68% of respondents said they did not want to take on any more credit, according to the report. And many respondents surveyed by KPMG indicated they intend to cut back on purchases both large and small: 43% said they will delay buying a car because of tariffs, and 70% said they already were or planned to use free ad-supported TV as an alternative to ad-free streaming services.\n\u201cThey\u2019re clearly looking at opportunities to save,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThey\u2019re switching providers where it makes sense, whether that\u2019s their streaming services, whether it\u2019s looking at insurance providers.\u201d\nBeyond tariffs and personal finances, KPMG\u2019s survey showedthat GenAIis playing an increasing role in people\u2019s personal and work lives. About 45% of respondents said GenAI is having a significant impact on their day-to-day personal life as well as their professional life, up from 41% and 40%, respectively last year.\nThe survey also showed that perceptions have shifted around higher education and that half of respondents said a degree isno longer essentialfor a well-paying career.\n\u201cApprenticeship, technical training and looking at how technology is advancing and how you can accelerate your skills much more quickly, all of that is playing in to those responses,\u201d Kramer said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/15\/economy\/consumer-tariff-survey-kpmg","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

On a monthly basis, prices were unchanged, versus a rise of 0.4% in February.\nRelated articleUS economy goes into reverse from Trump\u2019s abrupt policy shifts\n\u201cThis was a good report, no question about it,\u201d Robert Frick, chief economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, told CNN in an interview Wednesday.\nHowever, that takeaway comes with a major caveat: Trump\u2019s sweeping policies \u2014 particularly cutbacks in federal jobs and spending massive tariffs and mass deportations \u2014 not only have injected substantial uncertainty into the economy but also have significantly raised recession risks, Frick said.\n\u201cBut let\u2019s not fool ourselves,\u201d Frick cautioned. \u201cThings will get worse later this year, probably later in the summer. But for now, we really need to cross our fingers and hope that incomes and jobs hold up, because those are the things that will insulate us against the effective tariffs and higher inflation.\u201d\nEconomists expected the PCE price index to cool sharply to 2.2% annually in March, likely due to falling energy costs as oil prices slumped on lower demand expectations.\nEnergy prices did indeed fall, plunging 2.7% in March. Food prices, however, saw their biggest jump in months, rising 0.5% from February.\nExcluding food and energy costs, the core PCE price index was flat for the month and slowed to an annual rate of 2.6% from 3%.\nIn any other environment, inflation heading towards 2% would likely fuel optimism that the Fed would resume its rate-cutting ways and lower interest rates.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s economy-shaking policy decisions, especially those that have triggered a trade war with China, theaten to put the central bank between a rock and a hard place by stagnating economic growth while driving inflation higher.\n\u201cInflation is set to pick up as tariff increases lead to higher goods prices,\u201d Gus Faucher, chief economist for PNC Financial Services, wrote in a note on Wednesday. \u201cThis will create a dilemma for [Fed policymakers]. Inflation is still above the [central bank\u2019s] 2% objective, but the labor market could start to soften, putting the committee\u2019s two goals in conflict.\u201d\nThe April jobs report is set to be released Friday and is expected to show a softening in employment gains but a still relatively stable labor market.\nHowever, other major economic data released Wednesday could portend some challenges for the months to come: In the first quarter,economic activity contractedfor the first time in three years (amid a surge of imports) and a separate report on private-sector hiring showed a precipitous drop-off in job gains.\nBased on Wednesday\u2019s Commerce Department data, the economy is holding up for now.\nConsumer spending rose 0.7% from February, marking a sharp acceleration from 0.1%.\nIt was the biggest monthly jump in spending activity in more than two years, Commerce Department data shows, as Americans rushed to buy products ahead of the bulk of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nBut the latest data lands at a time when uncertainty is swelling about the extent to which Trump\u2019s massive policy moves \u2014 including a broad array of tariffs \u2014 could upend global order and the US economy.\nHelping to fuel spending was a 0.5% jump in personal incomes, a strong rate that bodes well for continued consumer spending, Frick said.\n\u201cThe No. 1 thing I always look for is income, because no matter how anxious people are feeling about the economy or inflation, if they have the money, they\u2019ll spend the money,\u201d he said.\nConsumers didn\u2019t sock away as much into savings last month as they did in February, but the personal saving rate came in at a healthy 3.9%.\nConsidering those household finance dynamics as well as inflation, Wednesday\u2019s release was a \u201cgood report\u201d but also another sign of a \u201ccalm before the storm,\u201d Frick said.\n\u201cIn the context of what\u2019s to come, it will help bulwark us against the effect of tariffs and [product] scarcity and layoffs that will be coming,\u201d he said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/30\/business\/us-pce-inflation-consumer-spending-march","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

That was a slightly smaller decline than a preliminary reading from earlier this month, which didn\u2019t capture people\u2019s reaction to Trump\u2019s 90-day tariff delay announced on April 9.\nSentiment in April was at its fourth-lowest level on records going back to 1952.\n\u201cWhile this month\u2019s deterioration was particularly strong for middle-income families, expectations worsened for vast swaths of the population across age, education, income, and political affiliation,\u201d Joanne Hsu, the survey\u2019s director, said in a release. \u201cConsumers perceived risks to multiple aspects of the economy, in large part due to ongoing uncertainty around trade policy and the potential for a resurgence of inflation looming ahead.\u201d\nStocks briefly jumped off their lows as investors assessed the latest survey: The Dow was down 200 points, or 0.5%. The S&P 500 was down 0.15%. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.1%.\nTrump\u2019s unpredictable trade war has weighed on Americans\u2019 attitudes toward the economy over the past few months, and now the Federal Reserve and Wall Street are watching to see if that means consumers become more cautious with their spending, or even pull back entirely.\nConsumer spending powers the vast majority of the US economy, so such a development would inherently mean weaker economic growth or even a recession.\nThe US consumer is clearly feeling uneasy, but it\u2019s unclear how that will translate into spending.\nIn June 2022, when inflation reached a four-decade high, consumer sentiment reached a record low, but shoppers continued to spend in the following months. And in 2023, when there was a standoff in Congress over the debt ceiling, Americans\u2019 economic mood soured but they still doled out on travel and concerts that year. Both economic growth and the labor market were on solid ground those years.\n\u201cSometimes the surveys are very negative, but they keep spending,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in remarksearlier this month.\nRelated articleFed Chair Powell gives starkest warning yet on potential economic consequences from tariffs\nHowever, today\u2019s economy is different from the one in 2022. The job market isn\u2019t running at the same red-hot pace; consumers have already exhausted any savings they accumulated during the pandemic; and just this week, the Department of Education announced it will resume the collection of federal student loans in default, ending a pandemic-era pause that began roughly five years ago.\nThere\u2019s also evidence that consumers becamemore financially strainedat the end of last year, according to the New York Fed\u2019s latest quarterly survey on household finances.Economists say it\u2019s been difficult to asses the underlying health of consumer spending because of temporary distortions to economic data, such as people front-running purchases of big-ticket items to beat Trump, tariffs, whichsent retail sales surging in March.\nBut as long as unemployment remains low and layoffs aren\u2019t picking up meaningfully, then spending should continue to chug along.\nThe lingering uncertainty over Trump\u2019s policies is also bedeviling central bankers who set interest rate policy, affecting the costs on everything from mortgages to credit cards.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs are widely expected to boost inflation, but its extent and duration is debated among economists. That\u2019s an important element that Fed officials are considering when considering their next moves once tariffs begin to show up in the data.\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know right now with confidence: Is this a one-time effect on inflation, or is it something longer term?\u201d Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Tuesday at an event in Washington. \u201cOur job with the Fed is to make sure it is not something longer term.\u201d\nRelated articleNot feeling the trade war pain yet?

Inflation expectations in the year ahead for April were slightly lower in the University of Michigan\u2019s final consumer sentiment report compared to the preliminary one, but they still reached their highest level since 1981.\nFor now, however, Fed officials haveadopted a wait-and-see approachto see how the US economy ultimately responds to the administration\u2019s slew of significant policy changes.\nTrump\u2019s shock therapy has already shown up in the so-called soft data \u2014 surveys such as the University of Michigan consumer sentiment report.

Consumers opted to put a good chunk in their piggy banks: The personal saving rate increased to 4.6% from a revised 4.3% rate in January.\n\u201cObviously, consumers remain jittery given spending remains subdued and savings high, but as long as incomes keep growing there\u2019s money to spend, which will support the economy and help Americans deal with persistent inflation,\u201d Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote Friday.\n\u201cWhile inflation ticked up, we have yet to know and feel the full effect of tariffs, especially on autos, and how much they will raise prices,\u201d he added.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/28\/economy\/us-pce-spending-inflation-february","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Why the American consumer is fed up","date":"2025-03-28","body":"Americans just feel like they can\u2019t catch a financial break. You know the feeling. You go to the grocery store, you look at the prices and you want to channel your inner Vince Lombardi: \u201cWhat the (heck) is going on out here?\u201d\nWorst of all, it feels like it\u2019s only going to get worse. There\u2019s a very good reason for that: Americans may, in a way, get taxed more when they go to buy things \u2013 more than they have for a long period of time.\nNo matter what some people will tell you, tariffs are, in fact, taxes. When you combine the potential tariff rates that the Trump administration could impose on us, the consumer, with the inflation that raged out of control coming out of the pandemic, it feels like things have gotten away from us.\nTake a look at a recent report from thenonpartisan Tax Foundation. It estimates that under President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs, the effective tariff rate will be 8% in 2025. That\u2019s so high that it would go off the page if you were charting tariff rates over the last 55 years.\nIndeed, you\u2019d have to go back to the 1960s to find a comparable rate. You\u2019d have to jump in a time machine back to when Americanswere still earningWorld War II victory medals (1946) to find a higher tariff rate on Americans.\nThe real world consequences of a heightened tariff rate could be a tremendous strain on the American consumer. TheYale Budget Labearlier this month estimated that Trump\u2019s tariffs could cost the average household $2,000 in inflation-accounted disposable income a year.\nThemedian household incomeis well under $100,000 per year.\nPrices for computers could rise by over 10%, by 5% for natural gas and even over 4% for something as simple as rice if the tariffs take effect.\nTheaverage price of a new carcould surge to over $50,000.\nNow, if we were only dealing with tariffs, it would be one thing. Every so often, prices get much more expensive very quickly.\nThe issue is that prices have already gotten much more expensive over the last five years because of heightened inflation. The cumulative inflation rate during that period, according to theConsumer Price Index, has been over 23%.\nWe haven\u2019t had a higher five-year inflation rate in over 30 years. The median five-year inflation rate since the late 1940s is only a bit more than 14%.\nTo stay with the grocery store comparison, the price of an average chicken is now over $2 more expensive than it was inFebruary 2020. The price of a loaf of white bread is $0.50 more expensive. A pound of ground beef is over $1.50 more expensive.\nNow, there are some things that aren\u2019t much more expensive at the grocery store (see bananas), but overall, your bill has gotten significantly larger if you\u2019re buying more than a few items.\nPutting tariffs on top of that could be a cross too much to bear for some people. Keep in mind that an estimated 25% to 30% ofAmericans live paycheck-to-paycheck.\nFor the rest of the populace, look at how the average person\u2019s incomehas changed, taking into account inflation and population growth. The growth over the past five years has been 2 percentage points lower than the median year since the early 1960s.\nThe real wage growth over the last four years, in which Congress passed a massive stimulus package at the beginning of the decade, has actually been -5%! There wasn\u2019t a single four-year period since at least the 1960s prior to Covid where there was anywhere near such a drop in income taking into account inflation.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that Americans are so pessimistic about the economy. Only once inCNN pollingsince the coronavirus pandemic began have a majority of Americans said the economy is good.\nOf course current or retrospective readings are one thing. Thoughts on the future are another. Belief that the economy would get better has generally been rising, according to theConference Board.\nThat was until the last few months. Fewer people are now expecting good things out of the future economy than at any point in over a decade.\nAfter having to deal with inflation and now potential tariffs, can you blame them?","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/28\/business\/consumer-economy-recession","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

That\u2019s hitting snacking,\u201d said Chris Costalgi, a vice president at market research firm NIQ, in an interview with CNN. Forty-two percent of consumers say they are buying fewer snacks because of higher prices, according to NIQ\u2019s February survey of 1,000 consumers.\nThe slowdown is showing up on food giants\u2019 bottom lines. PepsiCo, Campbell and JM Smucker have reported weak sales of their snack brands in earnings announcements in recent weeks.\nPepsiCo, the owner of Frito-Lay, said that people bought 3% fewer snacks last quarter. \u201cSalty and savory snack categories underperformed\u201d the broader packaged food industry, PepsiCo said, citing the \u201ccumulative impacts of inflationary pressures and higher borrowing costs on consumer budgets.\u201d\nPeople also stopped buying as many Goldfish crackers and Snyder\u2019s of Hanover pretzels. Campbell, which owns both brands, saw a 2% drop in snacks during its latest quarter, noting that snack sales were \u201cweaker than anticipated.\u201d\nAnd JM Smucker, the owner of Hostess, said people bought 5% fewer snacks during its latest quarter as more \u201ccautious\u201d and \u201cselective\u201d consumers turned away.\nOverall, salty snack purchases declined 0.3% during the 52 weeks ending on February 23, according to market research firm Circana. Cookies also dropped 0.3%.\nThe pullback on snacks comes as shoppers dial back on larger purchases, too, such asairline travel, major homerenovation projectsand clothing.\nMany companies are also noting a consumer slowdown because of inflation fears, President Donald Trump\u2019stariffs on imported goodsand a wobbly stock market.\nSpending at US retailers last month wasmuch weaker than expected, in a troubling sign of strain on shoppers. Retail sales rose 0.2% in February from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Monday.\nWeak consumer spending figures are adding to concerns that the US economy is slowing - andperhaps heading into a recession.\nSnack prices have gone up more rapidly than other store items. While grocery prices have increased 23% since February of 2021, prices for chips have increased 29%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\nThe average price of a 16-ounce bag of potato chips last month was $6.50. In February 2021, the average price was $5.05,according to the BLS.\nTo cut costs, consumers often switch from pricier big brands like Doritos to private-label brands sold by Walmart, Costco and other retailers.\nShoppers have also balked at companies downsizing bags of chips, cookies and other products while raising prices, a phenomenon widely known asshrinkflation.\nLast year, PepsiCo - which owns Lay\u2019s, Doritos, Tostitos and Ruffles - said it wouldtemporarily put more chips in some bagsto claw back customers tired of higher prices with skimpier bags. A PepsiCo spokesperson told CNN in October that Tostitos and Ruffles \u201cbonus\u201d bags would contain 20% more chips for the same price as standard bags in select locations.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/18\/business\/snacks-economy-pepsi-campbell","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

It covered everything from boosting people\u2019s incomes to establishing a childcare subsidy system, and expanding a \u201ccash-for-clunkers\u201d program to trade in old goods like cars and electronics.\nThe plan builds on Premier Li Qiang\u2019s promise during a major political meeting earlier this monthto ensurethat the \u201cgiant ship of China\u2019s economy\u201d will \u201csail steadily toward the future.\u201d\nHe had set an ambitious growth target of \u201caround 5%\u201d for this year. That would be possible only by boosting spending, to ensure China doesn\u2019t need to rely on exports to power its vast but slowing economy.\nAt anews conferenceon Monday to answer questions about the plan, Li Chunlin, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, the top planning agency, acknowledged that consumer confidence remained weak.\n\u201cThere is still a lot of work to be done to boost consumption, expand domestic demand and better meet the people\u2019s needs for a better life,\u201d he said.\nBesides suffering from low consumer confidence, China faces economic problems such as an uncertain employment outlook and a prolonged property sector downturn. Internationally, it\u2019s also being squeezed as the United States turns the heat up on a trade war against China.\nTrump doubled tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20% as of this month. In response, China has announced a fresh round of retaliatory tariffs, covering US agriculture imports, which took effect last week.\nOn Monday, official figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that retail sales, a measure of consumption, rose 4.0% in the January to February period. It was slightly faster than the 3.7% rise reported in December and met the expectations of a group of economists polled by Reuters.\n\u201cChina\u2019s economy had a decent start to the year, likely driven by fiscal stimulus,\u201d Zichun Huang, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a Monday research note. \u201cWe expect the recovery to continue over the coming months, but given the wider headwinds weighing on China\u2019s economy, we don\u2019t expect any near-term improvement to be sustained for long.\u201d\nThe country has been dealing with the persistent problemof deflation,which gives people little incentive to spend because they\u2019re expecting prices to drop more in the future. This tends to drag down consumption, which is an important component of economic growth.\nLast week, NBS said China\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI), a benchmark for measuring inflation, fell by 0.7% in February from the previous year. It was the index\u2019s lowest level in more than a year.\nAs for industrial production, which measures the output of industries such as manufacturing and mining, NBS said on Monday it expanded by 5.9% in the first two months of the year, slightly ahead of Reuters estimates of a 5.3% rise.

Consumer sentiment fell 11% this month to a reading of 57.9, a preliminary reading showed, down from last month\u2019s reading of 64.7 and reaching its lowest level since November 2022. That\u2019s a sharp retreat from December, after the US presidential election, when sentiment rose to its highest level in months.\nRelated articleWall Street is turning its back on Trump and flashing an economic warning\nThe Trump administration\u2019s rollout of its long-promised tariffs has been both erratic and contentious: Earlier this month, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, only todelay those duties againafter pleas from business leaders; then after US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports went into effect Wednesday, the European Union and Canadaresponded swiftlywith their own tariffs.\nThat\u2019s caused uncertainty to intensify in recent weeks,rattling Wall Streetand making it difficult for companies to plan ahead,according to recent business surveys. It\u2019s also sowed inflation fears. Americans\u2019 expectations for inflation in the year ahead climbed to 4.9% this month from 4.3%, the highest level since November 2022 \u201cand marking three consecutive months of unusually large increases of 0.5 percentage points or more,\u201d according to a release.\n\u201cMany consumers cited the high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors; frequent gyrations in economic policies make it very difficult for consumers to plan for the future, regardless of one\u2019s policy preferences,\u201d Joanne Hsu, the survey\u2019s director, said in a release.\n\u201cConsumers from all three political affiliations are in agreement that the outlook has weakened since February,\u201d she said.\nThe tariff-induced uncertainty comes as the US economy shows some signs of weakness \u2014 and the jury is out as to whether the situation will take a turn for the worse.\nIn January, consumer spending declinedfor the first time in nearly two yearsas home construction plummeted. Executives at major companies such asTarget,WalmartandDelta Air Lineshave recently warned of consumers feeling stretched and possibly pulling back this year. A closely watched real-time forecast of economic growth from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta shows the economy contracting a sharp 2.4% in the current quarter.\nAnd of course, various consumer surveys have showed that Americans are feeling uneasy.\nTrump did not rule out the possibility ofa recession this year, when asked in an interview that aired Sunday. That triggered a massive selloff on Wall Street.\nStill, the economy could keep its head above water simply because America\u2019s labor market is holding steady, with unemployment stillat a historically low level.\n\u201cThe consumer has been the workhorse of this economic cycle that will remain the case even as we move through this slower consumption patch,\u201d Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, told CNN. \u201cAnd the biggest driver of consumption in the US tends to be the labor market.\u201d\nIn addition to signs of a slowing economy, short-term inflation expectations have trended up in recent months as Trump\u2019s tariffs threaten higher inflation if a global trade war spirals out of control \u2014 a toxic combination resembling \u201cstagflation.\u201d\nRelated articleFed Chair Powell says he\u2019s not worried about the economy amid Trump\u2019s tariff chaos\nThat\u2019s a scenario in which growth flattens or turns negative as inflation picks up.

Adjusted for inflation, it sank 0.5%. Those are the biggest monthly declines since February 2021.\nSpending on goods \u2014 particularly autos and other big-ticket items \u2014 dropped off the most, Friday\u2019s data showed. Consumers continued to spend on the essentials, such as housing and gas, while also putting their discretionary dollars toward eating out and other leisure activities at hotels.\nAt first glance, January\u2019s spending slump, the first negative monthly reading in nearly two years, appears to substantiate an increasingly unsettling picture of the economic outlook.\nNot only do price pressures remain, but a slew of recent data indicates that the US economy is indeed softening: GDP growth is slowing, business investment has been sluggish, consumer sentiment has soured, jobless claims are picking up and inflation expectations are on the rise.\nAmid stubborn inflation, thousands of government workers losing their jobs, and costly tariffs looming, consumer sentiment declines.\nRelated videoConsumer confidence dips amid concerns about tariffs, jobs\nHowever, economists note that January\u2019s slowdown in consumer spending also could reflect factors such as frigid weather, deadly wildfires, a natural retreat from goods splurges the months before, auto dealers cutting incentives after a blockbuster December and also just pure caution.\n\u201cConsumers are scrambling to process the winds of change coming out of Washington, and have apparently decided to sit it out and wait,\u201d Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote in a note to investors on Friday.\nTo be sure, as incomes shot higher in January (rising 0.9%), consumers socked those dollars away instead of spending. The personal saving rate skyrocketed in January, jumping to 4.6% from 3.5%, Friday\u2019s report showed.\n\u201cSpending was much lower than expected; however, it came after pretty strong readings in the prior months \u2014 partly tied to holiday spending as well as the rebuild from the hurricanes that happened in October and September,\u201d Beth Ann Bovino, US Bank\u2019s chief economist, told CNN in an interview.\nTo that end, Bovino and others anticipate there could be a rebound in spending in the coming months, considering the labor market remains solid and as the Los Angeles area rebuilds from devastating wildfires.\n\u201cBeyond the dramatic drop in spending that could be explained as temporary, the report had good news on inflation and excellent news on income,\u201d Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in commentary Friday. \u201cSpending tends to follow income, and while consumers are jittery as evidenced by recent weak consumer sentiment and consumer confidence measures, if people have money, they usually spend it.\u201d\nExcluding food and energy prices, which tend to be more volatile, the closely watched core PCE price index rose 0.3% for the month and 2.6% from a year before, slowing from 2.9% in December.\nThe cost of food (especiallyeggs) and energy pushed up theConsumer Price IndexandProducer Price Indexreadings for January. That had economists expecting PCE would rise about 0.3% from December but that the annual rate would slow to 2.5% from the initially reported 2.6%, FactSet estimates show.\n\u201cThe good news from this report is that inflation didn\u2019t come in hotter than we, and looks like markets, expected,\u201d Bovino said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that cooler reading is going to change the Fed\u2019s path, given a lot of uncertainty over inflationary White House policies; but it does reduce the risk of fewer cuts.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s reading puts inflation back within striking distance of the Fed\u2019s 2% target and indicates that some disinflationary trends are still in play.\nHowever, close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.\nThe Fed itself indicated that it could take until 2027 for the pace of price hikes to stabilize at that 2% level.\nIt\u2019s widely expected that the Fed will hold rates steady when policymakers meet in March. Given the latest inflation read, Bovino anticipates that the next cut could come in the summertime.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, on Friday raised alarm about the potential negative ramifications if the Fed does not move to cut rates.\n\u201cWith flashing warning signs \u2014 dissipating labor gains, declining investment, and falling consumer confidence \u2014 today\u2019s inflation data shows that the Fed has a small window to act to cut interest rates,\u201d she said, categorizing the Trump administration\u2019s policies as creating a \u201cchaos economy.\u201d\n\u201cAt its meeting next month, the Fed should modestly cut rates to provide a buffer to respond to future uncertainty,\u201d she wrote.\nPrices remain elevated, and the cumulative effects of high inflation and high interest rates continue toweigh heavily on Americans, especially those who have little wiggle room in their monthly budgets. As of December 2024, prices were 10% higher than their pre-pandemic trend, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows.\nThe pullback in spending comes at a time whenAmerican consumers are growing increasingly pessimisticon fears that inflation will pick up because of President Donald Trump\u2019s talk of wide-ranging tariffs, according to various surveys.\nTrump has floated reciprocal tariffs on America\u2019s trading partners and 25% duties on Mexico and Canada as well as an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods.\nRelated articleAmericans are getting fed up with the economy. Does that mean we\u2019re heading into a recession?\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s February consumer survey showed that long-run inflation expectations surged to their highest level in nearly three decades.\nThe concern with higher inflation expectations is that they can be self-fulfilling to some extent: If consumers anticipate that prices will remain high, they might pull the trigger on large purchases and demand higher wages, and businesses might raise prices in response.\nRecent data has indicated shifts in purchases made by consumers and businesses \u2014 likely tied to uncertainty around tariffs.\nFed officials have expressed in recent speeches that it\u2019s crucial for people to keep faith that inflation will eventually return to normal in the long run.\nWhile uncertainty has swelled in part because of the shock-and-awe policy moves from the Trump administration, it remains to be seen how actions such as steep and broad tariffs, mass deportations, and theshrinking of the federal workforcecould affect the broader economy.\nComerica\u2019s Bill Adams noted that the consumer spending drop and the jump in the trade deficit could end up weighing on real GDP growth in the first quarter.\n\u201cThe question is the extent to which they are one-offs,\u201d he wrote in commentary. \u201cImport growth will likely be strong in February as well, as companies race to get ahead of decisions on tariff increases. But like January\u2019s drop in consumer spending, this is probably a temporary drag on GDP, since much of these imports will be companies pulling forward purchases that they otherwise would have made later in the year.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Bryan Mena and Elisabeth Buchwald contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/02\/28\/economy\/pce-inflation-consumer-spending-january","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The index fell to 98.3, falling for the third-straight month and marking the largest monthly decline since August 2021, as expectations for inflation in the year ahead climbed.

The National Federation of Independent Business\u2019 Uncertainty Index rose in January to its third-highest reading on record.\nAmerica\u2019s souring economic mood, driven by worries over President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive approach to tariffs, is a stunning reversal from the (brief) burst of optimism after President Donald Trump\u2019s election in November.\n\u201cThe fact that consumers don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s smooth sailing \u2014 you\u2019ve got one very obvious suspect.

But some have expressed the importance that expectations remain in check.\nIf Trump\u2019s policies cause inflation to pick up, \u201cit could be appropriate to ignore or look through an increase in the price level if the impact on inflation is expected to be brief and limited,\u201d St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said at a recent event in New York. \u201cHowever, a different monetary policy response could be appropriate if higher inflation is sustained, or long-term inflation expectations rise.\u201d\n\u201cI would be especially concerned by evidence suggesting (inflation expectations) are becoming unanchored,\u201d Musalem said.\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said Sunday in an interview with News Nation that the run-up in inflation expectations reflected in the University of Michigan\u2019s survey \u201cwasn\u2019t a great number.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s only one month of data.

The investment, which will come from JPMorgan\u2019s capital, directly, and from venture capital, is designed to enhance large and mid-sized companies\u2019 growth and drive innovation and strategic manufacturing, according to apress release.\nThe plan aims to facilitate $1.5 trillion in investments over 10 years. JPMorgan had previously aimed at delivering $1 trillion in investments to these initiatives.\n\u201cIt has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing \u2013 all of which are essential for our national security,\u201d said CEO Jamie Dimon, in a statement.\nThe announcement comes as President Donald Trumprevived a trade war between the US and Chinaon Friday, with Trump threatening to impose new triple-digit tariffs on Chinese imports.\nTrump\u2019s threat followed Beijing\u2019stightening of its control on rare earths, a group of critical minerals essential in the production of a wide range of electronics, automobiles and semiconductors. However, on Sunday, the Trump administration appeared to soften its tone, and markets were set to rebound Monday.\nBut the renewed tensions demonstrated how a major investment in companies aimed at US self-reliance could pay off in a new era of tariffs, trade wars and standoffs.\n\u201cOur security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America\u2019s economy. America needs more speed and investment,\u201d Dimon said.\nThe initiative will help ensure reliable access to critical medicines, minerals, defense capabilities, and energy and microchips to power AI, Dimon said. Rising tensions around the world, particularly with China, have challenged America\u2019s ability to secure all of those crucial needs.\nJPMorgan will hire an unspecified number of additional bankers and other investment staffers to execute its investment strategy, and it will create an external council to help guide it, the bank said.\nShares of JPMorganChase (JPM) rose more than 1% in premarket trading.\n\u201cHopefully, once again, as America has in the past, we will all come together to address these immense challenges,\u201d Dimon said.

But they\u2019re now showing the strain of inflation, President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and astock marketplunge.\nThat\u2019s a problem because consumer spending accounts for roughly70% of the US economy.\nConsumers proved resilient throughout Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Theypowered throughpandemic-driven inflation and the higher interest rates brought in to control it, thanks to a robust labor market and rising wages that helped buttress spending and drive the economy.\nBiden entered the White House in the depths of the pandemic and left office withstrong economic growth, monthly job gains for the entirety of his presidency and the stock market at record highs. But he also presided over a steep rise in housing, child care and other household costs that contributed to Trump\u2019s victory in 2024.\nThe Trump administrationhas said it\u2019s trying to\u201cturn back the economic plague unleashed by the Biden Administration.\u201d\nBut American  business leaders are now sounding the alarm about consumers freezing up, in part due to Trump\u2019s policies. Consumer confidence last month registered itsbiggest monthly declinesince 2021, according to the Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index.Airlinesare warning that consumer demand for travel is slowing, and shoppers arebuying lessclothing, home decor and other goods.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs have rattled consumers, businesses and investors, but the president has stayed the course, saying that his tariffs could cause \u201ca little disturbance.\u201d In aninterview with Fox Newson Sunday, Trump declined to rule out the possibility of a recession, contributing to astock market selloff this week.\nIn early March, Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada after delaying them for a month \u2014then quickly lifted tariffs for all Canadian and Mexican importsthat fall under a North American free trade agreement after discussions with those countries\u2019 officials. Meanwhile, Trump doubled tariffs on China to 20% on top of existing duties.\nThe Trump administration has warned that it\u2019s not done with its overhaul of US trade policy, promising to deliver reciprocal tariffs \u2014 tariffs that match other countries\u2019 dollar for dollar \u2014 next month. On Tuesday, Trump said in a social media post that he would add a25% tariffon Canadian electricity and a 50% tariff on all steel and aluminum imported from Canada.\nTariffs threaten to raise the prices Americans pay fora wide array of goods, and many economists say they will slow US economic growth.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this kind of breadth of tariffs. This, of course, impacts the whole (retail) industry,\u201d Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said on a call with analysts last week. Best Buy expects its suppliers to pass along some tariff costs to retailers \u2014 \u201cmaking price increases for American consumers highly likely,\u201d she said.\nTrump\u2019s tariff policy also comes as prices pick back up. Inflationheated upto 3% last month for the first time since June.\nIt\u2019s all taking a toll on US consumers and businesses.\nDelta Air Linesslashed its profit outlookMonday, warning that deteriorating corporate and consumer confidence is hurting travel demand.\n\u201cThe outlook has been impacted by the recent reduction in consumer and corporate confidence caused by increased macro uncertainty, driving softness in Domestic demand,\u201d Delta said in a filing with theSecurities and Exchange Commission.\nRetailers are also getting hit hard. The S&P 500\u2019s retail index, which tracks a broad range of retail companies, has dropped 13% in 2025 and fallen to its lowest level in more than a year.\nTarget, Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s, Home Depot and other chains have warned investors of a bumpy year ahead, with consumers dialing back spending on non-essential items.\n\u201cPersistent economic uncertainty has consumers taking a cautious approach to spending, particularly in discretionary categories,\u201d Target CEO Brian Cornell said on an earnings call last week. The company said that \u201ctariff uncertainty\u201d will impact its profit this quarter.\nKohl\u2019s (KSS) said Tuesday that sales could drop as much as 6% this year, sending its stock down 25%.\nThe economic uncertainty has taken the biggest toll onlower-income consumers, Kohl\u2019s CEO Ashley Buchanan said Tuesday on a call with analysts.\nConsumers making less than $50,000 a year are \u201cpretty constrained,\u201d she said, and \u201cit\u2019s also pretty, pretty challenging\u201d for customers making less than $100,000 annually.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/12\/business\/consumer-spending-trump-retail","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

While the exact details remain unclear, the president has said he is seeking to rebalance trade agreements between the US and its global partners.\n\u201cThe consumer sees darkening clouds for the economy ahead,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote last Friday after two closely watched economic reports painted a pained picture of the American consumer.\nThe Commerce Department reported that inflation-adjusted consumer spendingrose just 0.1% in February as Americans shored up their savings accounts, while a separate surveyshowed that consumer sentiment plunged 12%in March.\n\u201cAnd while they may not always be right, if they do not start spending again, this latest negative reading on confidence will become a reality,\u201d Rupkey added.\nConsumer spending powers more than two-thirds of the nation\u2019s economic activity; so if that engine falters, the economic consequences can start spiraling.\n\u201cConsumers, they need willingness and ability,\u201d Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America, told CNN. \u201cThe willingness (consumer confidence) they don\u2019t have; the ability (the income) is waning away.\u201d\nWhile Friday\u2019s Commerce Department data showed that personal income posted solid gains for the second consecutive month, real (inflation-adjusted) income after taxes is up just 1.8% year-over-year.\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty weak,\u201d North said. \u201cIt\u2019s not zero, but it\u2019s pretty weak.\u201d\nIf both disposable income and confidence are decaying, drops in core spending are likely to follow, he said.\nHowever, it also remains unclear whether the tepid January and February spending were reflections of recessionary or inflationary fears or if they were merely a step back after a purchasing surge in the finals months of last year, said Shannon Grein, Wells Fargo economist.\n\u201cWhile real spending came in weak, and we had some downward revisions to the prior month\u2019s data, I just think it\u2019s a little too soon to write off the consumer,\u201d Grein said.\nWages continue to outpace inflation, and overall income growth has been strong thanks to a still-tight labor market.\nHowever, a lot is riding on the continued health and stability of the jobs market.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big risk: Does this labor market data begin to turn in a way that causes consumers to really pull back on spending?\u201d she said. \u201cBut the ultimate fundamental for the household sector is income, and that\u2019s still in a decent position.\u201d\nStill, Greincautions, that\u2019s not the case for all households.\nAn ongoing theme of the post-pandemic recovery has been a widening bifurcation of American household finances. Lower-income and younger consumers are struggling more, living paycheck to paycheck and stand to face the brunt of tariff pressure, she said.\nDebt balances have beenon the rise, along with delinquencies.\n\u201cWe see that lower-income and younger borrowers are driving those delinquency rates higher \u2014 they\u2019ve maxed out,\u201d she said.\nHowever, on a macro level, the health of consumers\u2019 mortgage loans \u2014 which are the largest component of overall US household debt \u2014 are serving as a notable offset, she added.\n\u201cMortgage delinquencies are only approaching pre-Covid levels, where they were sitting at historic lows,\u201d she said. \u201cThe equity held in the single-family housing market is still near an all-time high.\u201d\nStill, she cautioned, the longer the uncertainty continues to drag on, the greater the chances that it could make people and businesses \u201cact in funky ways.\u201d\n\u201cI think the uncertainty of it just leads to more behavioral outcomes than just a simple implementation of a tariff could or would,\u201d she said. \u201cThe recent data are posing this question of, \u2018Is this all just temporary tariff effects, where people are just trying to act on the uncertainty?\u2019 Or is this a new sign of weakness that\u2019s finally showing up in the data?\u201d\nAnd while a recession is not the base case for Grein nor Wells Fargo, an overall cooldown is likely.\n\u201cI am bracing for a slowdown in growth, just based on this wait-and-see approach that\u2019s happening for businesses, households and the [Federal Reserve],\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re too far gone, but I do get more worried the longer this uncertainty persists from a growth perspective.\u201d\nVictor Yarbrough is cognizant of that widening gap. He\u2019s one of three brothers behind Brough Brothers Distillery, the first Black-owned bourbon distillery in Kentucky.\nBrough Brothers\u2019 original distillery is located where the brothers grew up \u2014 Louisville\u2019s West End, a section of town that was once considered a \u201cHarlem of the South\u201d but has suffered economically, especially in recent decades.\nTimes appear to be getting harder for some residents, Yarbrough said in an interview with CNN.\n\u201cTwo blocks away, there\u2019s a church that has food drives, we\u2019ve seen a lot more people carrying food baskets away each time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s telling me that for a lot of people \u2014 even in an economically depressed area \u2014 things are getting worse.\u201d\nAt the same time, Brough Brothers is in the midst of a massive expansion that includes a second, larger facility \u2014 complete with an event space \u2014 across town and has been planning (until just recently) to broaden its international distribution. The European Union and Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey and bourbon have thrown those plans into disarray.\nYarbrough said his company is doing everything it can to adapt but is concerned about how his customers will be able to navigate these times if prices of many goods go up.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very competitively priced, but the reality is, if people don\u2019t have jobs, then they can\u2019t spend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a necessity.

{"title":"Private equity wants in on your 401(k). What you need to know before investing","date":"2025-06-13","body":"Chances are very good that your 401(k) does not currently offer you access to private equity investments, which, as the name implies, are investments in companies that are not publicly traded.\nThe question is, will that change in the next few years? And, if it does, is it worth it for you to invest?\nLarge company pension plans and university endowments \u2014 both of which have very long time horizons \u2014 have invested for years in private equity and private debt funds. But 401(k)s typically haven\u2019t offered those options to plan participants. In November 2024, only 2.4% of 401(k) sponsors said they added a private equity investment option to their plan, according to a weekly poll question from the Plan Sponsor Council of America.\nThat may be because employers are afraid of potential lawsuits if they include those options, which typically charge investors more than investment funds in public companies. And under the Employment Retirement Security Act (ERISA), employers have a fiduciary duty to ensure that investment options in your 401(k) are prudent and have reasonable fees, said Jerry Schlichter, founding partner of Schlichter Bogard, who pioneered lawsuits against plan sponsors for charging excess 401(k) fees.\nIt also may be because private assets are riskier to invest in and information about them is opaque, since they\u2019re private. So there is less of a requirement to be transparent with investors about how a fund is doing on a regular basis.\nIn addition, private capital options are considered illiquid investments because you can\u2019t take your money out whenever you want. And that may prove too constraining for retirement plan participants, who may need access to their 401(k) money for any number of reasons \u2014 including changing or losing a job, Schlichter said.\nThere has been an increasing push to provide more private capital investment opportunities for retail investors and participants in workplace retirement plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s.\nOn the regulatory front, according to Jaret Seiberg, a financial services policy analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, the Trump administration is likely to make it easier to access so-called alternative investments, which include private equity, private real estate and hedge funds.\nThat could result in an executive order from the president requiring government agencies to expand access to such investments as well as rulemaking or guidance from the Department of Labor \u2014 whichenforces ERISA\u2014 \u201cto expand the ability of individuals to invest in 401(k) and IRA accounts in alternative investments,\u201d Seiberg said in a daily research note.\nThere arefar fewer public companies todaythan there were 30 years ago, as more companies remain private.\nFor that reason, some say, if investors want to own the whole market and have a truly diversified portfolio, where some asset classes move up when others move down, they should have access both to public and private companies.\nIn a recent conversation with Morningstar, BlackRock chief operating officer Robert Goldstein noted that the performances of publicly traded stocks and bonds have become more correlated than they used to be, and \u201cmany of the less correlated assets are only accessible through the private markets.\u201d\nThat may be. Or not. For average retail investors, it could be hard to tell because there currently isn\u2019t a centralized way to track the performance and underlying investments of private capital funds and directly compare them to that of the stock and bond funds and indexes they\u2019re used to.\nThat\u2019s just one reason why other market watchers and investor advocates worry about expanding access to private capital for average retirement savers.\nAmong those squarely in the camp of those who say employee and retiree nest eggs won\u2019t be helped \u2014 and could be harmed \u2014 by having exposure to private capital is Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, a nonprofit seeking to promote the public interest in financial markets.\n\u201cWhy is there a push to open up the private markets to 401(k)s now? It\u2019s not because workers want less liquid and harder-to-value assets in their 401(k)s. And it\u2019s not motivated by plan sponsors, who have long worried that exposing 401(k) plan participants to private market assets would violate their fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the investors,\u201d Schiffrin said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s because private market firms are finding it harder now to raise money. Their traditional sources of funding \u2014 institutional investors such as pensions and endowments \u2014 have evaporated.\u201d\nIndeed, for plan sponsors, including private equity among their plan\u2019s investment options will require a lot more due diligence from them in terms of investigating the underlying investments in a given fund and examining the fee structure, Schlichter said. \u201cThis is fraught with danger. A company that puts private equity in its 401(k) is undertaking a serious risk of breaching its fiduciary duty.\u201d\nCredit ratings agency Moody\u2019s this week put out an analysis, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which cautioned that the accelerated push to give private capital firms access to the multitrillion-dollar retirement investment industry holds risk for everyone.\n\u201cCompetition for retail investor capital within private markets will intensify as alternative asset managers roll out new partnerships and special funds to address this potentially vast, still largely untapped market,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cBut rapid growth within this still relatively opaque market also carries systemic implications.\u201d\nOne example, they cited, is the potential for a liquidity crisis. \u201cUnlike institutional investors, retail investors expect ready access to their cash. To help, managers are launching products with periodic windows of liquidity. But in volatile markets, retail investors may run for the exits, which would exacerbate liquidity needs and the risk of potential mismatches between a product\u2019s available liquidity and what investors are expecting.\u201d\nThe promise of investing in private equity is that the additional expense and risk assumed by investors can be rewarded with potentially strong returns over time.\nWhile it\u2019s hard to easily and quickly track private equity performance on your own, there have been academic and industry studies on it, and the results have been mixed, said Jason Kephart, senior principal for multi-asset strategy ratings at Morningstar.\nSo, while you will likely pay more and have less transparency into what you\u2019re investing in, having a stake in private capital is no guarantee that you will enjoy meaningfully better returns in your portfolio.\nAs for the diversification argument, Kephart said, it\u2019s worth remembering that just as with public companies, private companies\u2019 performance will be affected by external forces such as economic downturns, interest rates, geopolitical concerns, tariffs and supply chain issues.\n\u201cBeing private doesn\u2019t shield you from the world,\u201d he noted.\nAnd, Kephart added, \u201cIt\u2019s not like the public markets are broken. Public stocks and bonds have paid off pretty well for those who\u2019ve stayed invested.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/13\/business\/private-equity-401k-investing-explained","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"Wall Street is relying on the Supreme Court to protect the Fed. Is that wishful thinking?","date":"2025-11-29","body":"Wall Street barely blinked at President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the Federal Reserve this year. But its confidence could be shaken with an upcoming Supreme Court ruling.\nTrump has launched an intense pressure campaign against the Fed during his second term, frequently demanding interest-rate cuts and threatening to fire Chair Jerome Powell. The central bank has lowered interest rates twice this year, in September and October, and has another opportunity to cut rates in December.\nYet investors remain confident in the Fed\u2019s ability to fight inflation \u2014 at least according to measures such as long-term interest rates on US Treasuries and inflation expectations.\nTheir faith hinges on a Supreme Court case overTrump\u2019s efforts to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor.\nIf Trump wins, the Fed\u2019s vaunted independence to set interest rates without political interference could crumble.\nBut Wall Street seems to believe the Supreme Court will ultimately opt to keep the central bank independent. Markets also seem to believe that none of the names floated to succeed Powell as Fed chair when his term ends in May pose a threat in that regard, either.\n\u201cFor now, Wall Street is very comfortable with Fed independence,\u201d said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at financial services firm DA Davidson.\nJust three days after Trump said he fired Cook in August \u2014 the first time a president has tried to fire a Fed governor in the central bank\u2019s near-112-year history \u2014 the S&P 500 closed at a record high as other major stock indexes pushed higher.\nMeanwhile, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, a benchmark used for the rates on various loans, has steadily declined since the spring, when Trump began to threaten firing Powell. That means investors don\u2019t see interest rates getting out of control in the next decade, a sign of confidence in the Fed.\nIndeed, long-term market-based inflation expectations, which capture Wall Street\u2019s faith in the Fed\u2019s ability to fight price increases, have remained in check throughout the year.\nBut fears of growing government deficits have driven up so-called term premiums, the extra yield investors demand for holding long-term bonds over shorter ones. Investors say concerns about Fed independence have also played a role \u2014 albeit a minor one \u2014 in the uptick.\nThe court has scheduled oral arguments in late January to determine whether Trump has the power to fire Cook. The president has cited unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The Justice Department is investigating, but she has not been charged. Earlier this month, Cook\u2019s lawyers said the allegations are \u201cbaseless\u201d andurged the department to drop its inquiry.\nIn a separate case in May, the justices said in an unsigned opinion that Trumpcould keep Gwynne Wilcox, whom he fired from the National Labor Relations Board, off the NLRB while she continues fighting in court to reverse her termination.\nBut SCOTUS specifically said thatdecision doesn\u2019t impact the Fed.\n\u201cMarkets took a great deal of comfort from that,\u201d Randall Kroszner, a former Fed governor, said at a central banking conference on October 31 hosted by the Peterson Institute for Economics (PIIE). He said investors \u201cbelieve that the Supreme Court will take a reasonable and balanced approach\u201d in the Cook case.\nInvestors are also closely watching Trump\u2019s nomination of the next Fed chair. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led the search, revealeda shortlist of five peoplefrom the White House, the Fed and the private sector. The list includes National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett as well as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.\nBessent told CNBC recently that Trump\u2019s announcement could come around Christmas.\n\u201cMarkets still seem to be fairly confident Fed independence will prevail, and I think this is in part because of the names that we saw for Fed chairman were reasonable,\u201d Francesco Bianchi, an economics professor and monetary policy scholar at Johns Hopkins University, said at the PIIE conference.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/29\/business\/wall-street-fed-supreme-court","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Trump isn\u2019t to blame for affordability woes. Neither is Biden","date":"2025-12-11","body":"President Donald Trump is blaming his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the affordability concerns that are roiling the US economy \u2013 and politics. Many voters, meanwhile, are blaming Trump for their financial woes.\nBoth sides might be wrong.\nBiden and Trump both made policy decisions that affected consumer costs, such as the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs that rattled supply chains or the stimulus that the Biden administration pumped into the economy just as it was coming out of the pandemic.\nHowever, prices are not set by presidents. They\u2019re set by businesses, sometimes through negotiations with customers. And as taught in Econ 101, prices are based greatly on supply and demand: More demand and\/or less supply, and you get higher prices.\n\u201cFor better or worse, presidents are held responsible for the economy,\u201d said Tyler Schipper, professor of economics at University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. \u201cBut many factors of the business cycle and inflation are outside the control of the president.\u201d\nOf course, presidents \u2014 whether Democrat or Republican \u2014 don\u2019t want to appear powerless about important voter issues, like the economy or affordability. So sometimes, the easiest solution is to put the blame on something or someone else.\nDuring his term, Biden said the problems associated with inflation were temporary \u2013 a result of pandemic-related supply chain issues, the fault of Russia invading Ukraine or greedy oil companies.\nNow in 2025, Trump is simply blaming Biden.\n\u201cI inherited the worst inflation in history,\u201d he said,falsely, last week at a Cabinet meeting. \u201cThere was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.\u201d\nBut the worst of inflation under Biden was mostly gone by the time Trump took office this year. The 9.1% year-over-year rise in prices that occurred early in Biden\u2019s term had fallen to 3% by January of 2025.\nEconomists agree much of the inflation problem under Biden was due to supply chain and production issues. People shifted their spending to buy more goods, creating bottlenecks at the nation\u2019s ports, leading to shortages that fed inflation.\nThe increase in demand was partially driven by something that most politicians don\u2019t want to criticize: the nearly $2 trillion financial stimulus package to keep the economy afloat during the pandemic that put $1,400 checks in the hands of many Americans. The bill may have been inflationary when it passed in March 2021, but it was alsovery popularamong voters.\nSome economists say that the stimulus passed by Biden and Democrats in Congress, while a mistake in retrospect, was understandable at that time.\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather have problem of overdoing (stimulus) and having inflation rather than underdoing it and having a deep recession and possible depression,\u201d said Brett Ryan, senior US economist at Deutsche Bank.\nBut the stimulus wasn\u2019t the only thing putting cash in the hands of Americans. Low interest rates led to a surge of mortgage refinancing, turning $430 billion home equity into cash put directly in the hands of homeowners, according to the Federal Reserve. Lower interest rates also reduced average payment by $220 per month, also boosting spending money.\nWe\u2019re in a \u2018windchill\u2019 economy, where things feel worse than they are\nAnother major affordability issue is rising housing costs. But that took root in the bursting of a housing bubble in 2007 that caused the Great Recession under former President George W. Bush, resultingin fewer homes and apartments being built, Ryan said.\n\u201cMost estimates are than we have an undersupply of between 3 million to 5 million housing units\u201d today, he said, adding that the blame shouldn\u2019t fall on any particular administration.\nInflation wasn\u2019t just an American experience coming out of the pandemic. It was a global phenomenon, spurred in large part by Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions on Russian energy.\nThe war drove up not only energy prices, but also fed into higher food prices. Both countries were major wheat exporters, and Ukraine also exported raw materials used in fertilizers.\nIn June 2022, soon after the start of the war, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 the US government\u2019s key inflation measure \u2014 spiked to 9.1% year-over-year. That same month, gas prices hit a record $5.02 a gallon according to AAA, up 62% from a year earlier.\nBut neither gas prices nor inflation stayed at those peak levels.\nBy the end of that year, gas prices fell to $3.19 a gallon before eventually hitting $3.12 a gallon by the time that Biden left office. And inflation in January of this year was at a 3% annual rise, which is identical to where it stands in the most recent reading.\nEconomists widely agree that Trump\u2019s tariffs policies are placing upward pressure on some prices, though not as much as they feared in the spring.\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said businesses so far have been reluctant to pass along the full tariff cost, in part due to fear of Trump\u2019s wrath and the uncertainty of the ever-changing tariff policy.\nBut that won\u2019t be the case forever, he said.\nPeople spend most of their money on services \u2014 such as housing, insurance, interest on consumer debt and health care \u2014 rather than goods. This means tariffs ultimately haven\u2019t had a huge impact on inflation.\nAt his press conference Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that if not for tariffs and their impact on prices, the annual inflation rate followed most closely by the central bank would be essentially at 2%, or at the target level it prefers to see price increases. Inflation was at 2.8% in its most recent reading.\nThat increase from tariffs has made the Fed reluctant to cut interest rates as much as Trump has demanded. While the central bank would like to see prices rise at about a 2% inflation rate, consumers who are struggling to pay bills want to see prices fall. That\u2019s not likely to happen.\nIn general, \u201cpresidents get more blame and credit for what goes on in the economy than they deserve,\u201d said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institute. \u201cVoters really don\u2019t like inflation. And Trump muddied the waters by saying he can bring down prices. They\u2019re not going to be happy with a 2% rate of increase.\u201d\n\u2013 CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace and Bryan Mena contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/11\/business\/trump-affordability-crisis-blame","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Embattled Fed Governor Lisa Cook makes first public remarks since Trump said he fired her","date":"2025-11-03","body":"Interest rates are in a good place to deal with persistently elevated inflation, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said Monday in her first public remarks since President Donald Trumpsaid he had fired her.\nCook, appointed by former President Joe Biden and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, is the first central bank official to ever be subject to a firing attempt. In a letter announcing her removal, Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud, which still haven\u2019t been taken to court. Cook sued Trump shortly afterwards, in what has becomea landmark case on presidential power and Fed independencethat will be decided next yearby the Supreme Court.\nThe court ruled that Cookcan remain in her role for now, and has scheduled oral arguments in January. Cook said Monday she is \u201cbeyond grateful\u201d for the support she\u2019s received in her legal battle with the Trump administration, but didn\u2019t comment further on the topic.\nCook has voted to lower interest rates in the past two Fed meetings, but hadn\u2019t commented publicly on the economy since before Trump said in August that he fired her. Fed officials routinely participate in public events to lay out their views on the economy in the spirit of transparency and helping investors understand the direction of monetary policy.\nIn prepared remarks for an event in Washington, DC, Cook offered a balanced perspective on the US economy, detailing the twin threat to the central bank\u2019s dual mandate of stable prices and full employment.\nShe pointed to signs of strain in the labor market, such as rising Black unemployment, but suggested there\u2019s more urgency to finish the job on inflation than to lower rates further to prevent mass layoffs.\n\u201cLet me be clear. I am committed to reaching our 2% inflation target,\u201d she said. \u201cI see the current policy rate as remaining modestly restrictive, which is appropriate given that inflation remains somewhat above our 2% target.\u201d\nCook\u2019s latest comments come at a time when Fed policymakersare dividedon how Trump\u2019s economic policies might impact prices, employment and economic growth.\nThere were \u201cstrongly differing views\u201d among officials at last week\u2019s rate-setting meeting, when the Fed lowered ratesfor the second time in a row, Chair Jerome Powell said in a post-meeting news conference. Two Fed officials cast dissenting votes, but for opposing reasons: Fed Governor Stephen Miran voted in favor a larger, half-point cut; while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid preferred to hold borrowing costs steady.\nThat was the first time since 2019 there were dissents calling for both easier and tighter policy.\nOn one side, Fed officials argue that any inflation spurred by Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff strategy will likely prove to be a one-off price increase and that the US labor market is at serious risk of falling off a cliff if the Fed doesn\u2019t continue to lower rates. Most of the officials in this camp are Trump appointees.\nPowell has characterized the notion of limited tariff inflation as \u201creasonable.\u201d Cook herself said \u201cthe effect of tariffs on prices, in theory, should represent a one-time increase.\u201d\nThe other side of the Fed debate argues that the risk of higher inflation is greater, especially when considering that inflation has remained above the Fed\u2019s 2% target for more than four years. In a Friday statement explaining his dissent, Schmid said he has heard \u201cwidespread concern over continued cost increases and inflation\u201d from people in his district.\n\u201cRising healthcare costs and insurance premiums are top of mind,\u201d he said.\nThe suspension of government data because of the government shutdown, which is nearing the longest on record, has made the Fed\u2019s job of judging the economyeven more difficult.\nCook didn\u2019t provide a full-throated call for rate cuts in her latest remarks, but said she is attentive to the risks around the labor market. She also didn\u2019t sound overly concerned with inflation, stating that her \u201cassessment is that inflation is on track to continue on its trend toward our target of 2% once the tariff effects are behind us.\u201d\n\u201cWe are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated,\u201d Cook said. \u201cEvery meeting, including December\u2019s, is a live meeting.\u201d\nAt the end of Monday\u2019s event, Cook said she believes public service \u201cis worth the scrutiny.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been motivated to do public service, given my family\u2019s history, for example, in the civil rights movement and my participation in it myself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I had to learn to have a thick skin if I thought the principle was worth pursuing.\u201d\n\u201cThis too shall pass,\u201d Cook added.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/03\/business\/fed-governor-lisa-cook-makes-first-public-remarks-since-trump-said-he-fired-her","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Jerome Powell\u2019s era of consensus at the Fed is over","date":"2025-11-17","body":"Federal Reserve policymakers are split over whether they should continue cutting interest rates, ending a period of consensus that has defined Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s leadership of the central bank.\nThe Fed\u2019slatest decisionto lower interest rates by a quarter point in late October was opposed by two policymakers: one official who preferred to hold rates steady, and another who wanted a larger rate cut instead. A pair of opposing dissents had not been seen since 2019. Earlier this year, more than one Fed governor cast a dissenting vote for the first time in more than three decades.\nThe growingdivide among Fed officialshas spilled out into public speeches in recent days, presenting a challenge for Powell as he works to retain consensus among colleagues.\nThat division is a direct result of the uncertainty in the US economy and questions around the impacts of President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policy. The murky economic outlook has divided the rate-setting committee, which is tasked by Congress to keep the labor market intact and to tame inflation. Some Fed officials want to continue to focus on reining in higher prices, believing that tariffs could jack up inflation. Other policymakers say it\u2019s time to prioritize a weakening labor market.\nEconomists say the potential implications of a divided Fed are a mixed bag, but nonetheless represent an extraordinary shift in the politics of the world\u2019s most powerful central bank.\n\u201cIf these intellectual disagreements aren\u2019t able to be reconciled, then that could affect the Fed\u2019s effectiveness and credibility,\u201d said Derek Tang, an economist at LHMeyer, a monetary policy analytics firm.\n\u201cIn the next decade or so, the Fed could become like the Supreme Court, with people voting along party lines,\u201d he said.\nAs leader of America\u2019s central bank \u2014 and chair of its influential rate-setting committee \u2014 Powell now has his work cut out for him, but the outcome may be beyond his control.\nOver the past few decades, the Fed chair has increasingly played a key part in shepherding the central bank\u2019s policy decisions through careful consensus-building efforts.\nWith inflation and jobs in \u2018tension,\u2019 Powell warns of the Fed\u2019s tightrope on interest rates\nThe Fed chair\u2019s role of seeking unanimous agreement notably began under former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, according to Jon Hilsenrath, a long-time Fed watcher and senior adviser at brokerage firm StoneX Group. It involves regular meetings with members of the Fed\u2019s seven-person Board of Governors and the 12 regional Fed bank presidents.\n\u201cPowell built on what Bernanke and (former Fed Chair Janet) Yellen did,\u201d Hilsenrath said. \u201cBut this kind of breakdown in consensus is beyond Jay Powell or his leadership.\u201d\nIn a post-meeting news conference after the Fed announced its October decision, Powell said there were\u201cstrongly differing views\u201damong officials on how to move forward. He had previously characterized the division as merely a \u201chealthy debate.\u201d\nDissents from Fed officials are expected to persist through the final meetings of Powell\u2019s term as chair, which ends in May. That could make it difficult for Wall Street to know what to expect from the Fed: The chances of a December rate cut are currently a coin toss, according to futures.\nThe Fed\u2019s policymaking these days has indeed gotten much more complex: During the pandemic-fueled recession in 2020, it was clear the Fed needed to lower borrowing costs aggressively \u2014 and keep rates at ultra-low levels \u2014 to shore up a battered economy. Similarly in 2022, it was obvious the Fed needed to hike rates aggressively to tamp down the fastest inflation in four decades.\nAt the same time, a more divided Fed could bode well for its credibility.\n\u201cThe market might also come to a conclusion that they\u2019re not going to make extreme choices or lock themselves in to decisions that could lead the economy and the financial system in the wrong direction,\u201d Hilsenrath said. \u201cIf there\u2019s more disagreement, then that kind of moderates the Fed\u2019s behavior.\u201d\nAssessing the economy became even harder during the government shutdown, which was the longest in American history and suspended the release of weeks of economic data. At their October meeting, Fed officials were left without key readings on inflation and employment, metrics that are vital for policymakers when considering how to address their dual mandate.\nWith the government now reopened,an upcoming deluge of datacould easily tilt the scales in either direction.\nOn the side of holding rates steady to tame inflation are three of the four regional presidents who vote on policy this year. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who dissented in October and preferred no rate cut, explained in a statement that his decision came about partly because people in his district have voiced \u201cwidespread concern over continued cost increases and inflation.\u201d\nHis colleague Alberto Musalem, president of the St. Louis Fed and also a voter this year, said this week: \u201cWe need to proceed and tread with caution, because I think there\u2019s limited room for further easing without monetary policy becoming overly accommodative,\u201d at a Thursday event in Evansville, Indiana.\nOn Wednesday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she would be \u201chesitant to ease policy further,\u201d and that it would \u201clikely be appropriate to keep policy rates at the current level for some time to balance the inflation and employment risks in this highly uncertain environment.\u201d\nThe Fed\u2019s newest governor brings a Trump perspective on the economy. Is anyone buying it?\nMeanwhile, the opposing camp includes officials who believe the Fed should continue to lower rates, primarily because they don\u2019t see tariffs as likely having a persistent impact on inflation. They also believe the labor market is at risk of falling off a cliff if rates aren\u2019t lowered quickly enough.\nFed Governor Stephen Miran, who has taken leave from his role as head of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers in order to fill a temporarily vacant seat on the central bank\u2019s Board of Governors, dissented on the Fed\u2019s decision last month to lower rates by a quarter point, instead backing a larger, half-point cut. In his latest remarks, he argued that borrowing costs are exerting more pressure on the economy than most think and that inflation is bound to slow \u201csubstantially\u201d regardless.\nMiran is joined by Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, also Trump appointees, who have called for rate cuts starting in July. They believe that with inflation close enough to the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2%, the primary concern should be the softening labor market.\n\u201cIf you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,\u201d Miran told The New York Times in an interview that published on November 1. \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason to run that risk if I\u2019m not concerned about inflation on the upside.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/17\/economy\/powell-fed-consensus","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump may have broken Wall Street","date":"2025-07-17","body":"A version of this story appeared in the CNN Business Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nThis past April, when President Donald Trump started flirting with the notion of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell,stocks and the dollar tumbledbecause investors worried that even talking about such a move crossed a red line. You can\u2019t even joke about that, the Wall Street intellectuals told us \u2014 the central bank\u2019s independence is simply too important.\nPowell himself said it wasnot permittedunder the law, and a choir of Wall Street analysts chirped about thesanctityof the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence.\nCut to July: Trump is waving a draft of Powell\u2019s termination letter in front of lawmakers, and Wall Street is cruising.\nStocks remain near record highs. The dollar and bond markets briefly jolted but recovered after Trump denied reports he was preparing to fire Powell.\nThis seems to point to two possibilities:\nTrouble is, there\u2019s only one way to find out, and that involves crossing the red line that Trump has been inching ever closer to.\nICYMI:The president on Tuesday nighttold lawmakers in a meetingthat he was going to fire Powell, possibly as soon as Wednesday, over a costly renovation at the Federal Reserve headquarters, according to a source briefed on the president\u2019s remarks who spoke to my CNN colleagues.\nTrump even gestured to a document he claimed was a termination letter for Powell, a person who was in the room told CNN.\nRelated articleTrump says it\u2019s \u2018highly unlikely\u2019 he\u2019ll fire Powell after suggesting otherwise in meeting with lawmakers\nThen, on Wednesday, Trump said publicly that firing Powell was \u201chighly unlikely \u2026 unless he has to leave for fraud.\u201d (Coincidentally, Trump\u2019s OMB head has accused Powell of lying to Congress about the renovation, which Trump on Tuesday said he believes is afireable offense.)\nPut simply: The US has never been this close to seeing what happens when the president moves to unseat the Fed chair. Everyone on Wall Street and across Corporate America should be freaking out.\nJust this past Friday, George Saravelos, global head of FX strategy at Deutsche Bank, wrote that it is \u201cstating the obvious\u201d that investors would interpret Powell\u2019s firing as a \u201cdirect affront to Fed independence,\u201d which is widely seen as vital to managing inflation.\n\u201cThe empirical and academic evidence on the impact of a loss of central bank independence is fairly clear,\u201d Saravelos wrote. \u201cIn extreme cases, both the currency and the bond market can collapse as inflation expectations move higher, real yields drop and broader risk premia increase on the back of institutional erosion.\u201d\nOf course, nothing like *waves hands wildly* all of this has ever happened. And the empirical evidence may be showing that markets, like everything else, can become so conditioned to chaos that all the old rules no longer apply.\n\u201cMarkets appear to be getting accustomed to a pattern, most notable in the area of tariffs, in which the Administration threatens fairly radical action, only to dial it back when the initial market reacts negatively,\u201d Jonathan Doh, professor of management at Villanova School of Business, said in an email. \u201cIn each successive round, the responses have been increasingly muted.\u201d\nThis is the much-buzzed-about TACO trade \u2014 the idea that \u201cTrump always chickens out\u201d \u2014 that has proven profitable this year. If there\u2019s a Trump-related sell-off, investors buy the dip, wait for Trump to change his mind or scale back the offending policy, and then ride the rally. (Increasingly, though, investors are skipping the whole panic-selling part and just assuming nothing Trump says is real until some watered-down version of it has actually happened.)\nTo be clear, even though stock markets shrugged at reports of Powell\u2019s imminent firing, the news did provoke some movement in the currency and bond markets. Wednesday morning, before Trump\u2019s denial, gold, the classic safe haven, and long-term bond yields went up, while the dollar fell almost 1%.\nThose reactions are pretty much what you\u2019d expect, said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, though he noted that \u201cin theory, the bond vigilantes should have reacted more vigorously,\u201d to the news. (\u201cBond vigilantes\u201d are investors who use their buying power to signal their disapproval of a policy \u2014 they were a big reason why Trump decided to pause some tariffs for 90 days back in April.)\nBut stocks\u2019 relatively muted response, he said, could reflect some troubling dynamics on the Street.\nFirst, traders may be signaling that they are more excited about the prospect of lower interest rates (the No. 1 thing Trump wants from the Fed) than they are worried about the central bank\u2019s protection from the political fray.\nStock investors, he said, may be \u201cso enamored with the idea of lower rates that they don\u2019t care if they come as the result of governmental interference.\u201d\nWhich is a pretty wild idea!\nWhen I asked Sosnick if the Fed\u2019s independence may not be as precious to the market as market participants have long claimed, he said:\n\u201cI will assert that central bank independence is critical, and I think that I\u2019m not alone with that belief,\u201d he added. \u201cBut maybe not.\u201d\nMore worrisome, perhaps, is how the Trump administration perceives the market\u2019s reaction.\n\u201cWe have to wonder if the earlier report was a trial balloon designed to see how markets might react if Powell were indeed fired,\u201d Sosnick said. \u201cQuite frankly, the relatively muted reactions from stocks and the 10-year bond might have increased the president\u2019s willingness to take action, since the initial reaction was hardly catastrophic.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/17\/business\/wall-street-trump-fire-fed-powell-nightcap","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The Federal Reserve ignored Trump\u2019s interest rate demands \u2014 and he\u2019s not taking it well","date":"2025-01-30","body":"The Federal Reserve kicked off its second Trump era right where it left off: Doing exactly what it wanted to do, ignoring President Donald Trump\u2019sdemandsthat it lower rates.\nAs you\u2019d expect, the movewas poorly receivedby the president.\nHours after the Fed announced its decision tohold rates steadyon Wednesday, Trump, who nominated Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his first term, accused Powell and his colleagues of failing \u201cto stop the problem they created with Inflation,\u201d according to a post on Truth Social.\nAlthough Trump has danced around the issue of whether he\u2019ll fire Powell or work to gain direct control of interest rate decisions, both of which Powell has said is illegal, Trump\u2019s latest clash with the Fed reopens the door to a radical possibility that the central bank, as most have come to know it over the last few decades, could be turned on its head.\nThe decision not to lower rates further came after the Fed slashed its key interest rate by a full percentage point over its prior three meetings last year, right before Trump took office.\nOn the campaign trail and since taking office, Trump has not only advocated for lower interest rates but said he\u2019ll \u201cdemand that interest rates drop immediately,\u201d as he told attendees of the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting last week.\nLower interest rates tend to raisestock prices and make it cheaper for people to borrow money, often giving a boost to a president\u2019s favorability. But lowering interest rates can also fuel higher inflation.\nIn a press conference Wednesday after the Fed\u2019s latest rate decision was announced, Powellhad little to sayabout Trump\u2019s remarks concerning the Fed.\n\u201cI am not going to have any response or comment whatsoever on what the president said,\u201d Powell told reporters. \u201cIt is not appropriate for me to do so.\u201d\n\u201cThe public should be confident that we will continue to do our work as we always have, focusing on using our tools to achieve our goals and really keeping our heads down and doing our work, and that\u2019s how we best serve the public,\u201d Powell added.\nPowell, who has been at the helm of the Fed since 2018, has been standing firm that as members of an independent government agency, Fed officials have no obligation to the president or any elected official. Furthermore, when asked by a reporter in November if Trump can fire or demote him or his colleagues on the Fed\u2019s board of governors,Powell curtly replied, \u201cNot permitted under the law.\u201d\n\u201cPrice stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time,\u201d Powell said in a speech two years ago. \u201cBut restoring price stability when inflation is high can require measures that are not popular in the short term as we raise interest rates to slow the economy.\u201d\nWhen the Fed began raising interest rates in the spring of 2022, Powell was receiving most of his criticism from Democrats \u2014 especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who in a June hearing that year accused him of sacrificing Americans\u2019 jobs for his inflation fight, warning he would \u201cdrive this economy off a cliff.\u201d (He didn\u2019t.)\nAt the time, the Fed had been aggressively raising interest rates to tame inflation, which hit a 40-year high in 2022. The Fed\u2019s actions that year substantially raised borrowing costs for Americans and the stock market sufferedits worst year since 2008. But without the rate hikes, inflation,which now hovers near the Fed\u2019s 2% target, could have remained elevated, adding to the financial stress many Americans are already experiencing.\n\u201cThe absence of direct political control over our decisions allows us to take these necessary measures without considering short-term political factors,\u201d Powell said in his 2023 speech.\nEllen Meade, a Duke University economics professor who had a 25-year career at the Fed, has coauthored research \u2014 which Powell and other current and former Fed officials have cited \u2014 that supports that view.\nHer research suggests that central banks with a higher degree of independence, which was measured based on factors such as if rate-setting officials cannot be easily fired by politicians as well as whether government officials can participate in policy meetings or overturn decisions, generally have lower inflation.\nThe primary reason for that, as Powell pointed out as well, is that more independence frees central bankers from having to succumb to short-term political pressures, which can often lead to inflationary policies. That also helps create more stable economic growth in the long term, Meade said, based on her research and other similar findings.\nBut by the same token, central banks have better economic outcomes when they are held to account by lawmakers and operate under policy mandates like the Fed\u2019s, which calls for the bank to target an annual inflation rate of 2% and full employment.\nIf efforts to undermine the Fed\u2019s independence are successfully challenged, it would be akin to \u201cremoving the institution,\u201d Meade told CNN.\nThe Fed is widely considered an independent institution, partly based on interpretations of the 1913 law that established it and the reforms brought by the 1935 Banking Act. But its independence, highly regarded by Wall Street, is a feature that gained its legitimacy through history.\nHowever, there have been times when the Fed did not act independently, which came at a steep cost.\nIn the 1970s when Arthur Burns steered the Fed, he was known for his chummy relationship with then-President Richard Nixon. At the time Nixon was campaigning for reelection, the US economy showed signs of inflation brewing. That should have prompted the Fed to begin the painful process of hiking rates to stem price pressures, but, knowing it would hurt Nixon\u2019s ratings in the polls, Burns resisted tightening policy.\nThe Fed\u2019s lack of independence in that situation contributed to a painful period of persistently elevated inflation, famously known as \u201cthe Great Inflation,\u201d former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke argued in his 2022 book on monetary policy. It was not until Paul Volcker came along to lead the Fed that inflation was finally vanquished, and he did that in large part by making policy decisions based solely on what economic figures call for, not based on what a sitting president demands.\nThat commitment to being data dependent has stuck around ever since.\nRecognizing the Fed\u2019s failings in the 1970s, Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act in 1977 to include additional reforms, such as requiring the Fed chair to report to Congress twice a year to testify on the central bank\u2019s activity. That expanded on the 1935 Banking Act, which weaned the Fed away from the Treasury Department to minimize partisan influence and established the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee in its current form.\n\u201cThe assumption that law is the exclusive source of Fed independence is wrong,\u201d said Peter Conti-Brown, a financial regulation scholar, ina Yale Journal on Regulation study. \u201cBut the opposite assumption, that law is irrelevant, is also incorrect.\u201d\nThe Banking Act of 1935 states that the president may remove members of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, the group of Fed officials thatincludes Powell, who are responsible for setting interest rates along with regional Fed reserve bank presidents \u201cfor cause.\u201d\nWhile not explicitly defined, \u201cfor cause\u201d removal has generally been interpreted to mean more than, for instance, \u201cpolicy disagreements,\u201d said Christine Chabot, a law professor at Marquette University, whose teaching focuses on constitutional law and US government agency independence.\nA Supreme Court case in 1935,Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, established precedent over how much power the president has in removing agency heads. The case involved William Humphrey, \u201can aggrieved conservative commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, who was fired by Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 over policy differences,\u201d the Brookings Institution wrote in a 2018 analysis.\nRelated videoWhy a clash between President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell looks inevitable\nHumphrey died shortly after his dismissal, but his executor sued for damages. The Court ruled in favor of the executor, saying the Constitution does not say the president has the \u201cillimitable power of removal.\u201d\nDespite that ruling and the 1935 Banking Act, the question at hand, Chabot said, is whether that restriction is in violation of the executive power granted to a president to appoint in the Constitution.\nIn the 2024 Supreme Court case of Trump v. United States, \u201cthe Court recognized an unrestricted power of removal (of appointees) as one of the president\u2019s core powers under Article II of the Constitution,\u201d she said. Therefore, that could be used to make the case that the \u201cfor cause\u201d removal clause currently limiting Trump\u2019s ability to fire or demote Powell is unconstitutional.\nAt the same time, Chabot pointed out that prior Supreme Court cases such as Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which ruled that a president can remove a CFPB director without cause since they have sole control of the agency, have been careful to \u201ccarve out\u201d what\u2019s referred to as \u201ca special historical status for the Federal Reserve.\u201d\nThat status dates back to the Sinking Fund Commission, an independent group proposed by Alexander Hamilton, which was authorized by the first US Congress to help manage the government\u2019s debt by buying and selling bonds. The two highest members of the commission were not subjected to at-will removal by a president.\nThat demonstrates \u201cthere\u2019s a very good precedent for the Federal Reserve, in particular, being independent,\u201d especially since it similarly buys and sells US debt, but in its case to affect interest rates, Chabot said. On the flip side, the initial three USdepartments established did not restrict a president\u2019s power to remove leadership there. \u201cSo, somebody could say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s really the historical precedent we should follow here.\u2019\u201d\nBut putting history aside, the Court would likely also take into consideration the economic implications of restricting the Fed\u2019s independence and its ability to carry out its congressionally mandated duties, Chabot said.\nFor instance, US Treasury yields, which influence the rates Americans pay to borrow money, \u201ccould skyrocket,\u201d a reflection of the larger premium traders would price in \u201cfor greater policy uncertainty and higher inflation expectations,\u201d Meade told CNN.\nOn the campaign trail Trump said, \u201cI feel the president should have at least a say in there. I feel that strongly,\u201d referring to the Fed\u2019s interest rate decisions. \u201cI made a lot of money. I was very successful. And I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve \u2014 or the chairman.\u201d\nBut after a barrage of backlash, Trump sought to soften that position. \u201cA president certainly can be talking about interest rates because I think I have very good instincts,\u201d Trump said in a Bloomberg News interview less than two weeks after he claimed he deserved a say. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m calling the shot, but it does mean that I should have a right to be able to talk about it like anybody else.\u201d\nMandating that Fed chairs and other officials meet with him will likely be a much easier case to win than removal of chairs and other Fed board members, said Chabot. That\u2019s because the Constitution specifies that the president \u201cmay require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/30\/business\/trump-fed-powell-independence","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Those are the two outcomes that would put rate cuts back on the table.\nOfficials still expect to trim borrowing costs twice this year, according to their latest economic projections released Wednesday, though eight officials are predicting one or no cuts this year, compared to only four who expected that in December.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell in his post-meeting news conference acknowledged the high level of uncertainty among American consumers and businesses \u2014 a lot of it stemming from the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cturmoil,\u201d he said. Powell said that \u201cit remains seen how these developments affect future spending and investment.\u201d\nThe Fed\u2019s key borrowing rate remains in the 4.25% to 4.5% range. Standing pat also allows Fed policymakers to see how the Trump administration\u2019s flurry of policy changes ultimately affects the US economy, he said. That includes hefty tariffs, mass deportations and a downsizing of the federal workforce.\nNobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman says he thinks businesses will sit on their hands instead of investing when faced with too much uncertainty.\nRelated live storyThe Fed holds interest rates steady as it tries to figure out the Trump economy\nIn recent speeches, officials have said they\u2019re willing to adjust interest rates in either direction, depending on what economic figures show.\nThe Fed\u2019s latest pause marks the second time in a row that the central bank held borrowing costs steady.\nFed policymakers also expect the economy to be weaker this year than previously thought, according to the projections. They also forecast inflation to be higher this year.\nTo put it simply, as the Trump administration sets out to enact structural changes, Fed officials see the US economy trending toward \u201cstagflation,\u201d a troubling combination of sluggish or negative growth and accelerating inflation. It remains to be seen whether the US economy ultimately slips into a period of outright stagflation, which last occurred in the 1970s.\nAll 12 Fed officials with voting power voted in favor of Wednesday\u2019s decision to hold interest rates steady, though Fed Governor Christopher Waller dissented to a decision to slow the pace of the central bank\u2019s offloading of securities on its balance sheet.\nHere are key takeaways from the Fed\u2019s latest decision as Trump proceeds with significant policy changes.\nTrump\u2019s policies remain a huge wild card for the Fed because of their potentially wide-ranging effects on the economy. As expected, Powell was peppered with questions from reporters on how the Fed is assessing Trump\u2019s policy changes and he said it\u2019s still an evolving situation with many unknowns.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs threaten higher inflation and weaker growth, his administration\u2019s aggressive crackdown on immigration can cause labor shortages in certain industries, his mass layoffs of federal workers could send some local economies into a recession, but his deregulation efforts and the extension of his 2017 tax cuts could promote growth. Put together, it\u2019s unclear what the \u201cnet effect\u201d of Trump\u2019s policies on the US economy will be, as measured by growth, inflation and the labor market.\nPowell said Trump\u2019s tariffs was a factor contributing to officials\u2019 higher inflation forecasts for this year, but he noted that it\u2019s difficult to gauge how much of the higher inflation expected this year will be due to the president\u2019s trade war.\nLate Wednesday, Trump said the Fed should reduce its benchmark rate as tariffs roll out.\n\u201cThe Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling April 2, when reciprocal tariffs are expected to go into effect, \u201cLiberation Day in America.\u201d\nRelated live storyThe US economy added 151,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%\nEarlier this month, Powell said officials will be guided by what economic statistics ultimately show, not what forecasts predict. The Fed leader said that data shows there\u2019s been a \u201ca moderation in consumer spending.\u201d\nWhile American shoppers might finally be pulling back some, the US labor market remains a sturdy pillar of strength for the economy. In February, unemployment stood at a low 4.1% as employers added a healthy 151,000 jobs. And new applications for unemployment benefits, often an early indicator of any shifts in the labor market, remain historically low.\nIndeed, Powell pointed to the labor market\u2019s resilience as a key bright spot in the US economy, adding that any unexpected weakening could force central bankers to resume cutting sooner.\n\u201cLabor market conditions are solid,\u201d Powell said.\nWhen asked to weigh in on the odds of a recession, which some economists say have grown in recent weeks, Powell said those chances haven\u2019t risen to concerning levels yet.\n\u201cForecasters have generally raised \u2014 a number of them have raised their possibility of a recession somewhat. But still at relatively moderate levels,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go back two months, people were saying that the likelihood of a recession was extremely low. So it has moved, but it\u2019s not high.\u201d\nThe so-called \u201chard data\u201d that captures actual economic activity remains solid, but Trump\u2019s agenda has already shown up clearly across various sentiment surveys, or \u201csoft data,\u201d Powell said Wednesday.\nOn America\u2019s souring economic mood, Powell said it\u2019s not clear how that will affect spending, which powers 70% of the US economy.\n\u201cThe relationship between the survey data and economic activity hasn\u2019t been very tight,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are times people are saying very downbeat things about the economy and then going out and buying a new car.\u201d\nBut not only are American businesses and consumers growing pessimistic about the economy, but they\u2019re also expecting inflation to ratchet higher and remain elevated in the coming years, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s latest consumer survey.\nRelated articleAmerican consumer sentiment plunges on trade war fears\nIf long-term inflation expectations continue to climb, that could force the Fed to consider raising interest rates. In 2018 during Trump\u2019s first trade war, rising inflation expectations was a key factor that Fed officials pointed to that would force them consider hiking interest rates, according to a declassified document detailing policy alternatives, known as the \u201cteal book.\u201d\nPowell said that he still believes that long-term inflation expectations \u201care mostly well-anchored,\u201d pointing to survey data from the New York Fed. The Michigan consumer survey for March showed that Americans\u2019 inflation expectations in 5 to 10 years registered their \u201clargest month-over-month increase seen since 1993.\u201d\nStill, Powell downplayed the marked increase in year-ahead inflation expectations.\n\u201cYou would expect that expectations of inflation over the course of a year would move around, because conditions change, he said. \u201cAnd in this case we have tariffs coming in. We don\u2019t know how big. There are so many things we don\u2019t know.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/19\/economy\/fed-rate-decision-march","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"4 reasons you probably won\u2019t get a $2,000 check from Trump soon (and 1 scary reason you might)","date":"2025-11-19","body":"President Donald Trump has promised to deliver $2,000 tariff rebate checks next year, raising hopes of a lifeline for millions of Americansstruggling to make ends meet.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money. We\u2019re going to be issuing dividends\u2026probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that, of thousands of dollars for individuals of moderate income, middle income,\u201dTrump saidMonday.\nAlthough Trump has suggestedthese checksare essentially a done deal, the reality is there are major, perhaps insurmountable,obstacles standing in the way.\nExperts tell CNN it is improbable the federal government willsend out $2,000 checksnext year \u2013 unless it looks like the US economy needs to be rescued from an imminent recession.\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely there is some sort of stimulus check sent out next year. I would be pretty shocked,\u201d Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, told CNN in a phone interview.\nBettors on prediction platform Polymarket seem to agree. Theyplace just an 11% chancethat Trump creates a tariff dividend by March 31.\nPerhaps the biggest obstacle is that the numbers don\u2019t add up.\nTariffs are undoubtedly generating gobs of money for the federal government.\nTrump\u2019s new tariffs are projected to raise $158.4 billion in total revenue in 2025, and another $207.5 billion in 2026, according toestimatesfrom the Tax Foundation.\nIt\u2019s hard to say exactly how much tariff dividend checks will cost because virtually no details have been released.\nStill, the Tax Foundation modeled three designs for tariff dividends \u2013 and all of them would cost more than the new tariffs are projected to bring in this year.\nFor instance, if the checks went out only to tax filers and spouses, and had a hard cut off at $100,000 in individual income, they would still cost $279.8 billion, according to the analysis. That\u2019s $121 billion more than projected new tariff revenue this year.\nAt the high end of the scenarios analyzed, tariff dividends could go out to tax filers and non-filers as well as spouses and dependents. That would cost up to $606.8 billion \u2013 or nearly double the combined 2025 and 2026 projected new tariff revenue.\nThat\u2019s a problem because the Trump administration has already held up tariff revenue as a way to offset the cost of the sweeping tax and spending package Trump signed into law earlier this year.\n\u201cThis is like the magic money tree. You just go to it anytime you need money. Of course, that\u2019s not reality,\u201d said Lincicome.\nAnother major problem is Congress would need to sign off on dividend checks \u2013 and it\u2019s far from clear there are the votes for that.\nDeficit hawks were already reluctant to back the president\u2019s tax law and this would only magnify budget worries.\n\u201cI find it extremely implausible that Republican budget hawks are just going to be okay with blowing another $300 billion to $600 billion,\u201d Lincicome.\nAfter topping $34 trillion for the first time in January 2024, the national debt has continued to mount,hitting $38 trillionlate last month.\nThere\u2019s no doubt many Americans could use $2,000 checks from Uncle Sam as they struggle to catch up to high prices at the grocery store, on car insurance and elsewhere.\nHowever, some economists warn that stimulus checks could backfire by worsening the affordability crisis.\nThe problem is that while some people may use the money to pay down debt, others would likely spend it, and that would increase demand. As the last inflation crisis demonstrated, boosting demand without increasing supply drives up prices.\nIn fact, many Republicans blamed former President Joe Biden\u2019s 2021 stimulus checks for causing the inflation crisis. That could make it difficult for those same lawmakers to support Trump-era stimulus checks.\nAcademic research has found thosestimulus checks contributedto the four-decade high in inflation, though they were hardly the only factor. Trillions of dollars in other stimulus, including Trump\u2019s 2020 stimulus checks and the Paycheck Protection Program also contributed.\nEven some Trump-friendly economists are highly skeptical.\n\u201cSending out checks to people is a bad way to stimulate the economy,\u201d Stephen Moore, co-founder of Unleash Prosperity and a former Trump economic adviser, told CNN in an email. \u201cIf there is tariff revenue, that should be used to cut income taxes across the board. Stimulus checks only stimulate inflation.\u201d\nAdditionally, redeploying tariff revenue to pay for dividend payments risks sparking arevolt among the so-called bond vigilantesthat drives up Treasury yields that set a benchmark for a number of loan rates. That in turn would make it even more expensive for small businesses to borrow and homebuyers to get a mortgage.\n\u201cWhat Congress and Trump are trying to do with stimulus, the bond market could take away instantly,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James.\nThat\u2019s one reason stimulus checks are normally reserved for actual emergencies like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic.\nBeyond the budget, political and economic obstacles, there are legal ones, too.\nMost Supreme Court justices during oral arguments earlier this monthsounded skepticalabout Trump\u2019s reliance on emergency powers to impose his global tariffs.\nThe Tax Foundation estimates the tariffs that could get struck down account for about 75% of the new tariff revenue coming in.\n\u201cIf the Supreme Court says the bulk of the tariffs are illegal, that could throw a wrench in the tariff rebate plan,\u201d said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation.\nFor all these reasons, investors and economists on Wall Street are hardly counting on the arrival of $2,000 tariff dividend checks in 2026.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that late night Truth Socials are not a direct line to reality,\u201d said Bob Elliott, CEO and chief investment officer at alternative investment firm Unlimited.\nHowever, one way Trump\u2019s $2,000 dividend checks could become a reality is if they become a necessity.\nIf trouble in the job market intensifies and the unemployment rate climbs significantly, then the White House could argue direct payments are necessary to prevent a recession or minimize the damage of one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we shouldn\u2019t want stimulus checks to happen,\u201d Mills said, \u201cbecause it would be an indicator of something wrong.

{"title":"Democratic unity fractures, paving the way for the government to reopen","date":"2025-11-10","body":"Enough Democrats caved.\nA Sunday night Senate deal may be on the verge of resolving the longest government shutdown on record \u2014 after a group of moderate Democrats dropped their key demand \u2014 a guaranteed extension of Obamacare subsidies.\nThe agreement opened the way for a Senate vote in which eight Democratic defectorsvoted to break the filibusterand to clear the first hurdle to reopening the government after nearly six weeks. Their move will offer relief to millions of Americans whose lives have been severely disrupted by the shutdown.\nBut the compromise was opposed by some key party leaders and is already igniting a firestorm of protests from progressives who accuse their more moderate colleagues of disastrously backing down, handing President Donald Trump a victory and turning their backs on millions of Americans who can\u2019t affordspiking health care premiums.\n\u201cI will not support a deal that does nothing to make health care more affordable,\u201d Democratic Sen Elizabeth Warren, a leading progressive, wrote on X. \u201cWe are in a health care emergency. \u2026 A vote for this bill is a mistake.\u201d\nIt might be crass to parse the human misery caused by the shutdown for a partisan win after a political duel that deprived millions of Americans offood benefits, left federal workers with $0 paychecks, and created chaos and safety fears incommercial aviation.\nBut the crisis \u2014 precipitated by the expiration of enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans,whose prices are skyrocketing\u2014 was fought for multilayered political reasons. It will influence judgments on Trump\u2019s second presidency and the Republican majorities in Congress and help define the trajectory of the Democratic Party\u2019s comeback bid ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nThe deal sets a date for a vote in the Senate on ACA subsidies in December, but falls well short of cementing their extension. It funds the government through January 30 and guarantees pay for federal workers furloughed during the shutdown and those who worked without pay. It also reverses Trump\u2019s firing of federal employees throughout the impasse and fundsfood stampsthrough 2026.\nOnce the package works through procedural steps in the Senate, the Republican-led House must be recalled to vote on the measure.\nThe headline here is that sufficient numbers of Democrats are folding without achieving the goal that led them to withhold votes from a government funding bill and halt federal operations at the beginning of October.\nOn the face of it, this looks like a massive failure. Democrats won no undertaking that Obamacare subsidies will be extended \u2014 despite insisting that such a move was their bottom line. The best they will get is a Senate vote. There is no guarantee that a bill extending subsidies will pass, considering the Senate\u2019s GOP majority. And the prospects of the Republican House endorsing it seem even more remote.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive leader who sits as an independent but votes with Democrats, said the compromise risked \u201ca policy and political disaster.\u201d He added before the Senate vote: \u201cMy own thought is that it would be a horrific mistake to cave in to Trump right now.\u201d\nMany leading Democratsargued their party\u2019s big winsin elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City last week were attributable to the effective way their candidates lacerated Trump overthe cost of living.\nNow, at the first chance they got to put that lesson into practice \u2014 fighting for the affordability of health care \u2014 they gave up, even though polls showed mostvoters blame Trumpfor the shutdown and agree with the Democratic position.\nThe blowback could be severe, exposing deep divisions in the party that may show the \u201cbig tent\u201d that leaders kept citing in the aftermath of last week\u2019s election victories may be more viable in theory than in practice.\nThere were many unhappy Democrats inside and outside the Senate. Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego warned he would not turn his back on Americans seeing their premiums sharply rise as he voted no on the resolution. \u201cAt a time when prices are already too high, Americans are shopping for health insurance and experiencing such sticker shock that they are being forced to sign up for a crappy, overpriced plan or not signing up for insurance at all,\u201d he said.\nThe leader of the Senate Democrats, Chuck Schumer, did not vote for the deal. But Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the party\u2019s No. 2 leader in the chamber, who is retiring next year and is therefore shielded from a left-wing backlash, supported it.\nAnother Democrat who voted for the deal, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, represents thousands of federal workers and welcomed the move to reverse firings during the shutdown. He also argued that the Senate vote on extending the enhanced subsidies would put the GOP on the spot. \u201cLawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don\u2019t, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,\u201d Kaine said.\nStill, assessments of the break in the deadlock that came on Day 40 of the shutdown must also factor in whether the Democrats\u2019 demand was achievable in the first place and whether the deepening pain of the shutdown, which is fast becoming a national crisis, was about to make their position unsustainable.\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat who opposed the shutdown all along, warned his party might overplay its hand by carrying on. \u201cI don\u2019t think much anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval,\u201d Fetterman told reporters.\nDemocratic leaders, dealing with intense fury over Trump\u2019s bulldozing presidency among their base, and disillusionment over the party\u2019s disastrous 2024 election loss, had no real political option but to fight \u2014 even if it was obvious that securing an extension to Obamacare subsidies might be unattainable.\nThe party may accrue some political benefits for forcing Trump into the longest-ever shutdown. Multiple polls showed more Americans blamed him and his party at a time when hisapproval ratingsare dipping into the kind of steep slump second-term presidents struggle to reverse.\nThroughout the shutdown, Trump, a billionaire surrounded by a Cabinet of millionaires and billionaires, seemed indifferent to the daily struggles of millions of Americans. It was easy for Democrats to portray him as cruel as his administration fought court orders to restore funding to food assistance for 42 million Americans. While Trump is pledging to talk more about affordability, that is an impression that might stick.\nAnd there is an unpalatable truth that some progressives prefer not to contemplate. Democrats have almost no power in Washington. They\u2019ve used their only leverage \u2014 the capacity to withhold their votes in the Senate, where 60 votes are required for most legislation \u2014 to frustrate a president who gets almost no pushback. That\u2019s not nothing.\nTrump seemed quite willing to allow the pain and anxiety of the shutdown to deepen for millions of Americans. He was implicitly daring Democrats to pick the suffering of one set of millions of Americans over the duress being experienced by millions more. With the president refusing to negotiate, it was incumbent on Democrats to consider whether the cost of carrying on was justified.\nProgressives are already dismayed about what many will see as a humiliating climbdown by Senate moderates. But another lesson from Democratic wins in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races last week was that moderate candidates racked up big victory margins. A pragmatic view of the shutdown as it stood on Sunday was that as the fast-worsening consequences became clear \u2014 with Thanksgiving travel chaos looming \u2014 Democrats may have risked losing their incremental political gains if public opinion swung against them as well as the GOP.\nIn that sense, the classic building of pressure that historically ends up forcing the reopening of the government \u2014 namely that political damage caused by carrying on is outweighed by the advantage of staying shut down \u2014 did its work again, albeit belatedly.\n\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s become clear as we go deeper into the second month of this Republican government shutdown that President Trump and Washington Republicans are weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt,\u201d Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said in a statement after voting to support the compromise deal.\nBut whatever the recriminations, there\u2019s no doubt Democrats succeeded in highlighting a core issue \u2014 the exploding cost of health care \u2014 which the GOP seems to have no viable plan to tackle.\nThe shutdown has not changed this issue: The health care system is broken, people may lose insurance, and Republicans may end up with the blame if they don\u2019t fix it, since they are the party in power.\nGiven the exhausting pace of the Trump presidency, and the multiple controversies unfolding at once under the chaos agent in the White House, it seems unlikely a shutdown now will play a major role in influencing the 2026 midterm elections.\nTrump may have gotten what he wanted.\nThroughout his presidency, business career and life, Trump has always tried to impose personal leverage. His self-image as a winner who doesn\u2019t give into pressure will exit the shutdown intact. Trump was determined not bend to Democrats employing the kind of hardline tactics he so often uses himself. And he didn\u2019t. The president warned that he wouldn\u2019t negotiate on health care with the government closed. And he held firm.\nBut the political cost wrought by his actions over the last 40 days could be considerable. He often looked callous, as though unconcerned about the real pain inflicted by the shutdown. After all, he went to the Supreme Court to try to overturn a court order requiring him to pay food stamp benefits. And when the deal was struck in the Senate on Sunday night, he was absent \u2014 after attending a Washington Commanders NFL game and spending the weekend at his luxury resort in Florida, reinforcing an impression he doesn\u2019t care about the economic concerns of regular Americans.\nAnd Republicans are still not off the hook on the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. GOP leaders now face the question of whether they are willing to let them expire, in a scenario that could put health care out of reach for millions of people. This seems an unsustainable political position in the run-up to midterm elections, and the issue is set to only gain in traction as the end of the year looms.\nAnd bitter divisions in the GOP \u2014 most graphically exemplified during the shutdown byGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene, with her scathing criticism of her party\u2019s dearth of ideas on health care \u2014 are likely to burst open when the House returns from its weekslong absence, and will again test the authority of Speaker Mike Johnson.\nThe shutdown drama also revealed rare signs that Trump\u2019s authority over his own party isn\u2019t absolute on Capitol Hill. Republican senators ignored his demands toabolish the filibusterthat requires most bills to get 60 votes in the chamber. Such a move would have given Trump almost unlimited power to use GOP majorities to transform the nation over the next year.\nBut GOP senators feared what any Democratic majority might do in the absence of the filibuster. Their position was a nod to a future in which Trump is not the dominant GOP figure, underscoring that lame-duck status may beckon even for a president who has shattered almost every convention of his office.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/10\/politics\/democratic-unity-fractures-government-reopen","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump administration starts funding full SNAP benefits for November","date":"2025-11-07","body":"EDITOR\u2019S NOTE:The Supreme Court later Fridaytemporarily paused a lower court rulingthat required the Trump administration to fully cover food stamp benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November. The administration had filed an emergency request hours after the US Department of Agriculture told states that it was working to comply with the ruling.\nThe US Department of Agriculture announced Friday it is working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal court order, and the process should be completed later in the day.\nSeveral states quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days.\nThe USDA\u2019s guidance, posted on theagency\u2019s website, is the latest step in a weekslong saga that has threatened vital food assistance for nearly 42 million Americans amid the federal government shutdown. A federal judge on Thursday directed the agency to providefull benefits, which the Trump administration quickly appealed.\nThe USDA told states last month that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as food stamps are formally known, had run out of money soNovember\u2019s benefits could not be distributed. The decision prompted two lawsuits, with two federal judges ruling that the agency must at least tap into emergency funds to provide partial benefits for this month or, at its discretion, use other revenue to fully fund November\u2019s allotments.\nIs the federal government shutdown affecting you? Tell us about it\nThe agency opted tofund partial benefits, but warned it could take weeks or months for some states to recalculate the allotments and distribute the assistance. That led the plaintiffs in one case to argue that the judge should require the USDA to fully fund the benefits to get the money out the door quickly.\nIt\u2019s not yet known what the administration\u2019s compliance will mean for the legal challenge pending before US District Judge John McConnell, who ordered the administration on Thursday to make full SNAP payments by the end of Friday.\nEarlier Friday, the administration asked a Boston-based appeals court to halt McConnell\u2019s order, but the appeals court had not issued a decision by the time the administration said publicly that it was complying with his directive.\nRoughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps, with payments distributed on a staggered schedule throughout the month. Households receive about $350 a month, on average.\nJust when food stamp beneficiaries will receive their assistance depends on where they live. Some states are expected to issue benefits immediately, while others may require a little more time.\nPennsylvania residents who should have already received their SNAP benefits this month will start seeing their full allotments hit their electronic benefit transfer cards on Friday, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced at a press conference. State officials worked quickly after McConnell\u2019s ruling to issue benefits.\n\u201cWe are hoping that by this evening, by midnight or so, that all of those individuals who were owed money over the first week or so of this month, who hadn\u2019t gotten it from the federal administration, are going to get their money,\u201d Shapiro said.\nWest Virginia also notified SNAP recipients on Friday afternoon that the state is sending full payments for November due to the court order.\nNew Yorkers can expect to receive their SNAP benefits starting Sunday, according to a statement from Gov. Kathy Hochul. And Massachusetts residents will start receiving their delayed benefits as early as Saturday, Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement.\nMeanwhile, North Carolina started distributing partial benefits to more than 586,000 households on Friday morning in line with the USDA\u2019s guidance earlier this week on providing partial benefits. Recipients could see their remaining allotments hit their cards possibly as soon as this weekend, the state Department of Health and Human Services said in a press release.\n\u201cWe will keep working to help folks put food on the table during this challenging time,\u201d Gov. Josh Stein said.\nFood stamp benefits total about $8.2 billion in November, with other expenses pushing the monthly cost up to nearly $9 billion.\nThe two federal judges said last week that the USDA was required to tap into the program\u2019s roughly $5.3 billion contingency fund, while McConnell ordered the agency on Thursday to also transfer additional unused tariff revenue used to support child nutrition programs in order to pay full SNAP benefits for November.\nIn its guidance, the agency did not specify how it was funding November\u2019s allotments.\nIt\u2019s unclear what Friday\u2019s announcement from the USDA will mean for the fast-moving legal fracas around the food benefits program. As of Friday afternoon, neither side in the Rhode Island case had notified either court of the development.\nJust after McConnell made his decision on Thursday, the administration appealed it to the First Circuit. By Friday morning, lawyers for the administration were pressing the court, which is stacked with appointees of Democratic presidents, to quickly put the directive on hold.\nThey argued that McConnell overstepped his authority when he issued his order, which they said \u201chas thrust the Judiciary into the ongoing shutdown negotiations and may well have the effect of extending the lapse in appropriations, exacerbating the problem that the court was misguidedly trying to mitigate.\u201d\n\u201cThis unprecedented injunction makes a mockery of the separation of powers. Courts hold neither the power to appropriate nor the power to spend,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThere is no lawful basis for an order that directs USDA to somehow find $4 billion in the metaphorical couch cushions.\u201d\nMcConnell\u2019s new order came after he said the administration had not worked fast enough to ensure at least partial benefits reached millions of the program\u2019s recipients and that it had acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d when it decided against providing the full benefits this month.\nThe coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses that brought the legal challenge late last month urged the First Circuit to swiftly reject the administration\u2019s emergency bid. In court papers filed Friday afternoon, their attorneys emphasized the on-the-ground impact of any potential intervention by the court, noting it\u2019s been nearly a week since recipients began missing payments for November.\n\u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d they wrote. \u201cPlaintiffs and the public will be severely and irreparably harmed if defendants are granted a stay, even a brief one.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/07\/politics\/emergency-appeal-snap-benefits-november","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"\u2018This is not a luxury\u2019: Families in Trump states agonize over GOP\u2019s proposed Medicaid cuts","date":"2025-06-26","body":"Courtney Leader has been closely following the contentious tax-and-spendingdebate in Washington\u2013 not that she cares much for politics, but because she believes the proposed Medicaid cuts are a matter of life or death for her daughter.\n\u201cThis is not a luxury. I do not have my daughter enrolled on Medicaid so we can have fancy things,\u201d Leader said. \u201cI have my daughter enrolled in Medicaid so we can keep her alive and keep her at home, which I think is the best option for her.\u201d\nAs the Senateopened a marathon voting sessionMonday on theRepublican billcontainingPresident Donald Trump\u2019sdomestic agenda, the real-world implications are playing out across the country at kitchen tables of parents like Leader, whose 9-year-old daughter with brain damage and cerebral palsy relies on Medicaid benefits for daily care and weekly therapy.\nShe wrote to Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, hoping to put a face on the Medicaid debate. She explained that her husband works as a carpenter, whose private insurance provides health coverage for the couple and their four other children. She said costly medical bills for their daughter, Cyrina, were too much for any household to bear.\n\u201cWithout Medicaid,\u201d Leader told her senator, \u201cwe would lose everything \u2013 our home, our vehicles and, eventually, our daughter.\u201d\nHawley did not identify Leader by name, but he shared her family\u2019s story in aNew York Times essaylast month as he first emerged as a rare Republican warning his party against cutting Medicaid for some of the 70 million low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program. He called such a move \u201cmorally wrong and politically suicidal.\u201d\nAfter pushing Senate leaders to include a $25 billion fund to help rural hospitals, Hawley said he would support the bill. But he previewed the risks ahead for his fellow Republicans about deep cuts to Medicaid, saying: \u201cYou cannot be a working-class party if you are taking away health care for working-class people.\u201d\nRelated articleTrump\u2019s massive agenda bill faces headwinds in the Senate after key ruling from chamber\u2019s rules referee\nIt\u2019s a pivotal moment in the tug-of-war over Trump\u2019s priorities, the centerpiece of which is a sweeping package toextend tax cutsto some of the wealthiest Americans, while reducing social safety-net programs for health care, food assistance and rural hospitals. The president has pledged not to cut Medicaid, even though the current version of the measure would do just that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, andadd more than $2 trillion to the deficitover the next decade.\nA visit to Missouri, where at least one in five residents depend on Medicaid for health coverage, offered a snapshot of the potential fallout from the sprawling legislation the president and Republicans have branded as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\n\u201cI know that they\u2019re saying they\u2019re not planning to cut Medicaid, right?\u201d said Leader, 36. \u201cBut I reached out, concerned that if any changes are made, there will be this trickle-down effect that will impact families like mine.\u201d\nAs she stood in her kitchen, getting ready to drive Cyrina to a morning therapy session about 30 minutes away, Leader ticked through the costs to sustain her daughter, who was shaken by a caregiver when she was four months old, leading to her condition. She has a complex web of medical and developmental challenges, but can stay in their home because of a nurse and weekly therapy appointments, the co-pays of which are paid by Medicaid, along with a feeding tube, formula and a litany of other supplies.\n\u201cThe formula that is delivered through a tube in her stomach costs more than my mortgage,\u201d Leader said. \u201cIt costs more than my entire food budget for our family and in that alone, there is no way that we could come up with that $1,500 to be able to feed her.\u201d\nWhile the legislation does not directly call for cutting benefits for medically complex cases, Leader believes that some existing services are still at risk, particularly in-home care that keeps her daughter out of a nursing home. She must recertify for coverage every year \u2013 on Cyrina\u2019s birthday in May \u2013 and believes any significant changes to programs administered by the state will add another layer of bureaucracy that she and other parents routinely endure.\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to protect us when they can\u2019t get paperwork done in time and we lose coverage for a month or two?\u201d Leader said, her voice rising with emotion as she raised concerns about state-level backlogs. \u201cI\u2019m worried that the red tape is going to affect our Medicaid because of just the oversight burdens and that as a result, I\u2019m going to lose my daughter because she\u2019s lost coverage before.\u201d\nThe Senate version of the bill is poised to make even deeper cuts to Medicaid than the measure the House narrowly passed in May. It is among the differences that must be reconciled if both chambers pass the legislation, which Trump is still pressing them to do before a self-imposed July 4 deadline.\nMore than 1,000 miles away from Washington, inside the bright hallways of Golden Valley Memorial Healthcare in Clinton, Missouri, a sense of anxiety over the Medicaid debate was evident on a recent afternoon.\nThe 50-bed hospital is not only a critical piece of the economy as the largest employer in Henry County, but also the only maternity ward and emergency room for about an hour\u2019s drive in each direction across this stretch of western Missouri.\n\u201cWe are paying very close attention because we want to make sure that those Medicaid benefits are preserved so our patients can continue to access care that they need,\u201d said Craig Thompson, CEO of Golden Valley Memorial. \u201cFor rural hospitals like ours, it\u2019s ranchers, it\u2019s farmers, it\u2019s small business owners and it\u2019s a whole lot of kids.\u201d\nAbout four out of five patients admitted to the hospital, he said, depend on Medicaid, the health care program for lower-income Americans, or Medicare, the program for seniors. Severe cuts to Medicaid, he said, would unnecessarily send more people to the emergency room and have devastating effects on his and other rural hospitals across the state.\nLast fall, Trump carried this rural county with 76% of the vote, which was 17 points higher than his Missouri victory. Yet the politics of health care is complicated, even here in Trump country, where voters also approved a statewide Medicaid expansion measure four years earlier.\nBefore that vote, Medicaid in the state was largely restricted to the elderly, disabled or pregnant. The expansion vote allowed about 340,000 Missourians to enroll in the program, according to the Missouri Foundation for Health, the funding of which is now uncertain, amid new work requirements and a long list of provisions.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a perception that Medicaid beneficiaries are respondent or even lazy, for lack of a better term,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThat\u2019s simply not what we see on a daily basis.\u201d\nDr. Jennifer Blair, who grew up about 45 miles away in the small Missouri town of Peculiar, said she fears maternity wards at hospitals like Golden Valley are at risk if some of the deep Medicaid cuts are realized.\n\u201cWe are surrounded by several maternity care deserts, which is defined as a county that has no or very limited access to obstetric services for their patients,\u201d Blair said. \u201cIf we were to lose that access to the birthing center here at Golden Valley, our patients would have to travel more than 60 miles.\u201d\nLong before the House passed nearly $300 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as food stamps, signs of increasing need have been clear at Ozarks Food Harvest, a 100,000-square-foot warehouse on the edge of Springfield. It serves about 30 million meals every year across one-third of Missouri.\n\u201cThe demand for food is quite a bit higher than it was even at the height of the Covid crisis,\u201d said Bart Brown, president and CEO of the non-profit food program. \u201cWe are seeing lots of new families that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\nThe SNAP program has always been solely funded by the federal government. The House measure called for passing along considerable costs to state governments, which are already facing difficult choices and balanced-budget requirements.\nThe move would have saved the federal government more than $128 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which House Republicans hoped to use to help cover the costs of extending the tax cuts. The Senate parliamentarian removed the provision on procedural grounds, making itone of the key differencesthe Senate and House must reconcile before passing the legislation.\nJune Owens isn\u2019t closely following the back-and-forth of the debate in Washington.\nShe arrived in a strip mall parking lot in nearby Marshfield shortly after 6 a.m. on a recent rainy morning, so she could get a spot near the front of a long and winding line of cars and trucks. She rolled down the window of her green Mercury to talk for a moment, waiting for the outdoor pantry to open at 9 a.m.\n\u201cLife wasn\u2019t always this way with us. My husband got hurt a few years ago and it changed our whole life,\u201d said Owens, 77, a retired bookkeeper. \u201cWe were in the process of getting all of our ducks in a row for retirement and it just upside-downed everything, so food pantries have helped us through the situation.\u201d\nAt Ozarks Food Harvest, seniors are the fastest growing segment of people who ask for food assistance, Brown said, citing their \u201cfixed incomes and inflation.\u201d\nHe is carefully watching the tax-and-spending debate in Congress, mindful that whatever the president ultimately signs into law will impact the lives of people in Springfield and across the southern Missouri region his organization serves with a mission statement of \u201ctransforming hunger into hope.\u201d\n\u201cAnytime that there\u2019s a change in federal benefits that results in a net loss, people have to meet that gap somewhere,\u201d Brown said, walking through his cavernous warehouse. \u201cThey\u2019re going to turn to food pantries and we\u2019re stretched thin anyway.\u201d\nThis story has been updated Monday with additional developments.\nCNN\u2019s Jeff Simon and Leonel Mendez contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/26\/politics\/medicaid-snap-cuts-trump-bill","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"The Trump administration is \u2018actively evaluating\u2019 portable mortgages. What you need to know","date":"2025-11-13","body":"The Trump administration has another idea to make housing more affordable: Let homeownerstake their mortgage rate with them when they move.\nOn Wednesday, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte said the administration is \u201cactively evaluating\u201d so-called portable mortgages. The proposal aims to address the housing market\u2019s lack of supply.\nThe administrationstepped up efforts to address housing affordability this past week. Pulte \u2013 who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-backed entities that guarantee more than half of US mortgages \u2013 said officials are also weighinghow to make mortgages assumableand whether to introducea new 50-year mortgage option.\nJust over half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%,accordingto a Redfin analysis of FHFA data. However, average mortgage rates have remained stubbornly stuck between 6% and 7% for the last few years. Homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates have been less willing to move and potentially pay hundreds more in interest each month on new mortgages at current rates.\nTrump just floated a 50-year mortgage. Is that a good idea?\nAllowing people to keep their lower mortgage rates could encourage them to move and free up supply. But there are questions about how that would work and whether it might wind up actually raising mortgage rates overall, said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\nWhen asked by CNN, the FHFA did not provide further details about its plans for portable mortgages. In a statement, a spokesperson said the agency was studying a \u201cwide variety of options\u201d to lower housing costs.\nA portable mortgage allows a borrower to transfer their existing mortgage and mortgage rate to a new property when they move, instead of taking out a brand-new loan.\nFor instance, imagine a homeowner selling their house for $400,000 with half of that paid off on a 3% mortgage. With a portable mortgage, they could sell their home and transfer the $200,000 left on the loan to the new house, keeping the 3% rate.\nAffordability is in crisis. The solution: You\u2019ll never own anything again\nThings get trickier if the new home is more expensive. If it costs $450,000, for example, the buyer would need to cover the extra $50,000 either in cash or through a second, smaller loan likely issued at the current higher interest rate.\nThe hope is that if homeowners could move without losing their low rates, more homes would go up for sale, giving buyers who\u2019ve been locked out a better shot, Wachter said. But the effects on supply would likely be limited, and it might take Congress passing a law to iron out legal wrinkles.\nPortable mortgages could disrupt the engine powering the US housing market: mortgage-backed securities. Those are essentially bundles of mortgages that banks or lenders sell to investors, which gives the banks the cash they need to issue new loans and keep the mortgage market flowing.\nIf homeowners can take their loans with them when they move, fewer loans will be paid off early \u2013 which means more risk for investors, who might demand higher interest rates to compensate, Wachter said.\nVoters blessed a building boom for affordable housing in New York. Is it a model for the country?\nAdditionally, mortgage agreements are clear contracts tied to a specific property, with the home\u2019s address listed as collateral. Transferring that loan to a new house would mean effectively rewriting the contract.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell what\u2019s going to happen, but it\u2019s going to be a logistical nightmare,\u201d said Justin Demola, the president of Lenders One, a national alliance of mortgage bankers. \u201cAll mortgages have a property address, a legal description. How do you get around that as you\u2019re taking the mortgage to the next property?\u201d\nThe Trump administration is also looking into a 50-year mortgage, but the proposalhas drawn backlashfrom some housing experts. They argue that the monthly savings would be minimal compared to the significantly higher interest costs over the loan\u2019s life versus a standard 30-year fixed mortgage.\nHere\u2019s why the housing slowdown isn\u2019t lowering home prices\nThe administration also brought up potentially allowing more assumable loans, meaning homebuyers can take over a seller\u2019s existing mortgage and mortgage rate. Most government-backed loans, such as those from the Federal Housing Administration, are already assumable. In fact, there are companies that help buyers find homes with assumable mortgages.\nHowever, Demola said he doesn\u2019t see many first-time homebuyers assuming other people\u2019s mortgages, since doing so typically requires a large cash payment or a second mortgage to buy out the existing loan.\n\u201cLoans have been assumable forever. You don\u2019t really see many being assumed right now,\u201d he said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/13\/homes\/portable-mortgages-what-to-know","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump just floated a 50-year mortgage. Is that a good idea?","date":"2025-11-11","body":"Most first-time homebuyers in the United States take out 30-year mortgages. Under a new proposal from the Trump administration, they may soon have an even longer loan option.\nThis week, President Donald Trump introduced a new idea to tackle home affordability: a 50-year mortgage loan. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte called the proposal \u201ca complete game changer.\u201d\nWhile Trump\u2019sproposal is light on details, administration officials say a 50-year mortgage would lower monthly payments, helping more Americans currently priced out of the market.\nBut many housing experts warn the plan could backfire, raising the cost of homeownership by stretching out payments, adding more interest over time and driving up home prices.\n\u201cThis is not a good idea,\u201d said Richard Green, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business. \u201cThe monthly payment savings would be really small. At the same time, you\u2019re putting people at risk, because it takes a really long time for them to start paying down their loan.\u201d\nThe 30-year mortgage loan traces its roots back to the Great Depression. Over the last century, it has become the dominant way to purchase a house in the United States. Many Americans prefera longer loan period because payments are lower than those of, say, a 15-year mortgage.\nA 50-year mortgage could have even lower payments.\n\u201cWhat it does is, it reduces the monthly payment quite a bit for a typical home for middle America by a few hundred dollars a month,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said in a Monday interview on Fox. \u201cWe need to help people get back into homes.\u201d\nBut homeowners would end up paying far more in interest over time, Green said.\nKevin O\u2019Leary on Trump\u2019s 50-year mortgage plan: \u2018You\u2019ll never own the home\u2019\nTake a $450,000 home, for example. With a 30-year fixed mortgage at a 6.25% interest rate, the monthly payment would be about $2,771. Over the life of that loan, the homeowner would pay more than $547,000 in interest.\nWith a 50-year loan at the same rate, the monthly payment would fall to around $2,452 \u2013 but total interest would balloon to about $1.02 million, or 87% more than on the 30-year loan.\n\u201cWith a 50-year loan, you\u2019re paying a teeny, tiny amount to your principal loan early on, so your interest payments are not going down very much,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt depends on what the interest rate is, but it could be like 30 or 40 years before you\u2019ve even paid half your mortgage (principal) under those circumstances.\u201d\nThe best way to improve housing affordability isto build more homeswhere people want to live, Green said. A cheaper home loan might boost demand, but without adding new supply, it could actually push prices higher.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether a 50-year mortgage would carry the same interest rates as a 30-year loan.\n\u201cUntil you figure out who the buyer is for that mortgage and how they\u2019re going to model out the borrower behavior, it\u2019s really tough to say anything more than the rate will probably be a little bit higher than the 30-year,\u201d said Jeff DerGurahian, chief investment officer at loanDepot, a mortgage lender.\nA 50-year loan carries a higher risk of default because it stretches so long. Lenders may charge higher interest rates as a result. And since it would take borrowers much longer to build equity, a drop in housing prices could leave more homeowners owing more than their properties are worth.\nThere\u2019s also a legal question surrounding 50-year mortgages. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, passed after the 2008 housing crisis, loan terms cannot exceed 30 years.\n\u201cYou would need a lot of legislation to bring this about,\u201d Green said of the 50-year mortgage proposal.\nWhen asked, the White House did not provide details about any legislative plans.\nIn a statement, a White House official said: \u201cPresident Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans. Any official policy changes will be announced by the White House.\u201d\nLast year, the average age of first-time homebuyers in America climbed to a record high of 40 years old, according todatareleased last week by the National Association of Realtors. A combination of sky-high home prices and mortgage rates stuck between 6% and 7% have locked many young Americans out of homeownership.\nWith a 50-year loan, some of those first-time buyers could be paying off their home loans well into their 90s.\nTrump is blaming homebuilders for the housing shortage. But the problem goes much deeper\nBut Phil Crescenzo, a vice president at Nation One Mortgage Corporation, said the industry has been overly negative on the 50-year mortgage proposal.\nWhile homeowners would build equity more slowly than with a shorter loan, Crescenzo noted that, in some cases, a 50-year mortgage could still be better than renting and never accumulating any home equity at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like somebody would have to stay in that loan forever. It\u2019s a starting point,\u201d Crescenzo said, pointing out that homeowners always have the option to refinance their loans.\n\u201cIf I had the option where I\u2019m renting the home or I can get a 50-year mortgage and I\u2019m not going to gain much equity for a couple of years, I would still take that deal versus renting,\u201d he said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/11\/business\/fifty-year-mortgage","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump is blaming homebuilders for the housing shortage. But the problem goes much deeper","date":"2025-10-21","body":"After five months and more rejected offers than she can remember, Stefanie Campagna was starting to doubt whether she might be able to buy a new home in Rochester, New York.\nThat was until this month, when one seller finally said yes. To get there, Campagna had to pay $100,000 over the asking price, outbidding 36 other offers.\nHer story is a sign of the times. In today\u2019s housing market, even the lucky ones often face exhausting ordeals and need tostretch their budgets to land a home.\nIn the past few weeks, President Trump has blamed America\u2019s largest homebuilders for the country\u2019s housing affordability woes. In a social media post this month, Trump compared homebuilders to oil cartel OPEC, accusing them of sitting on empty lots to keep home prices artificially high.\nEconomists broadly agree that America\u2019s affordability crisis is rooted in a long-running shortage of homes, a supply problem years in the making.\nHomebuilding fell dramatically in the years leading up to the 2008 housing crash and never fully recovered.\nYet builders and economists say this supply shortage isn\u2019t caused simply by builders sitting on empty lots. They say that building new homes has only gotten harder, slowed by regulation, labor shortages and high financing costs.\nSome in the industry worry that Trump\u2019s immigration and trade policies will make matters worse.\nA \u201cperfect storm\u201d of high demand, low supply and mounting costs led to America\u2019s \u201cnational housing emergency,\u201d said Shaun Donovan, a former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the Obama administration.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working in housing for 30 years and I\u2019ve never seen an affordability crisis this bad,\u201d Donovan told CNN.\nLocal zoning and red tape are at the heart of the problem, Donovan, who is currently the CEO of Enterprise Community Partners, said.\nAstudyfrom the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) found that nearly 25% of the price of a typical newly built single-family home is due to regulations imposed by state, local and federal governments. The NAHB has lobbied against what it calls \u201cregulatory burdens\u201d around building homes.\nIf land-use regulations were relaxed, an extra 2.5 million more housing units would likely be added over the next decade \u2014 eliminating about two-thirds of the estimated housing shortage, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs.\nThe analysis also noted that large-scale reform would be \u201cchallenging\u201d to implement because most regulations are set at the local level.\nBureaucracy can slow down projects in places where homes are desperately needed.\nOren Amir, founder of Go Home Builders in Los Angeles, said some of his rebuilding projects in Altadena, where residential areas were destroyed by January\u2019s wildfires, have been delayed by conflicting guidance from the city on rooftop solar panel requirements.\nAnd the housing shortage has spread beyond coastal cities normally dominated by Democrats to rural areas in Republican strongholds. This has created interesting bedfellows, where politicians on both sides of the aisle increasingly agree that regulations must be streamlined to support supply.\nFor example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat,recently signed a billthat overrides local zoning by allowing for more density near transit stops in some California counties. Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, has also enacted laws aimed at increasing housing supply and cutting red tape.\nBut it\u2019s not only governments that slow projects down. There is often community resistance that stalls the building of homes.\nThat NIMBY, or \u201cnot in my back yard,\u201d opposition is driven by a range of concerns, from overcrowding to worries about radically changing the character of communities.\nNIMBY concerns are a leading obstacle to adding more housing supply, Donovan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get communities to understand we\u2019re not talking building skyscrapers,\u201d he said.\nIn Rochester, where Campagna lives, these national trends are playing out in real time. Zillow\u2019sMarket Heat Indexranks the city among America\u2019s hottest housing markets. Post-pandemic demand and chronic underbuilding in the area have left buyers competing fiercely, often bidding tens of thousands above asking.\nCampagna compared one open house to an \u201coutdoor concert.\u201d\n\u201cThere were easily more than 100 people there,\u201d she said.\nBut not every part of the country has fallen so far behind demand. In Sun Belt states like Texas and Florida, where some of America\u2019s largest homebuilding companies are concentrated, steady construction in recent years has helped keep home prices in check, and in some cities, even pushed them down.\nA Texas homebuilding CEO, who requested anonymity over concerns that his comments could draw immigration scrutiny to his job sites, said zoning isn\u2019t a problem in his state, which has no statewide zoning laws.\nWhile he broadly supports Trump\u2019s efforts to strengthen border security, the homebuilding CEO told CNN he fears the administration\u2019s intensifying immigration crackdown could backfire and slow down homebuilding by shrinking the already small pool of construction workers.\nThe federal government must have the \u201ccourage\u201d to fix the \u201cbroken\u201d immigration system, which includes providing a path to allow nonviolent undocumented immigrants to stay in the country and work, said Jim Tobin, CEO of the NAHB. He said the industry wants a visa program for legal immigration for people working in home construction, like the visas common in agriculture and technology.\nMeanwhile, new tariffs on construction materials like softwood lumber and distribution transformers are also making homebuilding more expensive.\nTrump\u2019s 10% tariff lumber imports will add $720 to the cost of an average home, while tariffs on kitchen cabinets and vanities will lift costs by roughly $280, according to research from UBS.\nAll told, tariffs are adding about $8,900 to the cost to build an average home, UBS found, noting that builders won\u2019t absorb the entire cost.\nLast month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump was weighing whether to declare a \u201cnational housing emergency\u201d this fall to tackle rising home prices.\nTrump has recentlytaken aimat America\u2019s largest homebuilders, including Lennar, D.R. Horton and Pulte, accusing them in a social media post of \u201csitting on 2 million empty lots\u201d and urging them to start building.\nHomebuilders have more clout than in the past, as the top 16 public homebuilders control about 47% of new construction, compared with 25% in 2013, according to UBS.\nWhile America\u2019s largest homebuilders do own millions of empty lots, beginning construction on those lots is more complicated than it seems, said Alan Ratner, a housing analyst at Zelman and Associates.\n\u201cHomebuilders need to acquire land several years in advance of ever building a house on it. Depending on what type of land they\u2019re acquiring, they might need to build roads and sewers and pipes and get utilities hooked up to that land,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of that, of course, is time-consuming. Not to mention getting the projects actually approved by governments to start building houses.\u201d\nCNN reached out to the 10 largest homebuilders that Trump mentioned in a recent social media post on the subject. None of the companies provided a comment.\nRatner said the fact that America\u2019s largest builders own millions of lots signals \u201cthey\u2019ve been positioning their businesses for growth.\u201d\nDonovan, the former Obama official, said he is encouraged by the signal Trump officials are sending to the industry by focusing on supply.\n\u201cYou\u2019re hearing the right words from the administration, but we need to see action that backs it up,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cYou don\u2019t solve a housing crisis overnight.

Now, Zillow has put a staggering number to those higher costs: America\u2019s housing market has climbed 57% since 2020, to a record $55 trillion.\nThat means that in just five years, the US housing market\u2019s value has climbed $20 trillion,accordingto data from the real estate company released Monday.\nZillow\u2019s findings highlight a housing market that remains historically expensive, with values climbing even aselevated mortgage ratessideline would-be buyers and force more sellers to slash asking prices.\nBut the housing market\u2019s gains haven\u2019t been spread evenly in 2025. New York added $216 billion in value over the last year, more than any other state. New Jersey, Illinois and Pennsylvania were close behind.\n\u201cDemand continues to outpace supply in the Northeast,\u201d Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist at Zillow, said. \u201cWhen you look at housing inventory in New York, there are only half as many homes for sale as there were before the pandemic. So you have the value of the existing housing stock really rising a lot in that market.\u201d\nIn contrast, pandemic-era boom states Florida, California and Texas lost billions in their housing markets in 2025. Once magnets for buyers seeking sunshine \u2013 and often looser Covid restrictions \u2013demand has started to cool off in these states.\nReal estate agents in Florida, California and Texas told CNN that inventory is building and that sellers have had to offer price cuts or concessions to entice buyers, who are increasingly reluctant to pay the same elevated prices they may have paid a few years ago.\n\u201cReal estate is cyclical, and we\u2019re definitely in a down cycle,\u201d Sharon Ross, a real estate agent in South Florida, recently told CNN. \u201cSellers are getting hit with lower offers, and I\u2019m trying to manage their expectations.\u201d\nThat\u2019s partially due to an explosion in home insurance rates and property taxes, Ross said. Florida, along with California and Texas, is particularly vulnerable toworsening natural disastersfueled by climate change, and the cost to insure a home has risen precipitously as a result.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had buyers cancel deals after they got the insurance quote,\u201d Ross said.\nAreportlast month from financial services company Intercontinental Exchange found that 85% of counties in Florida showed home price declines compared to a year ago. The report also found that prices declined in California, Texas, Colorado and Arizona by more than 3% from post-pandemic highs.\nBut while overall buyer demand has faded, new home construction has helped prop up housing market values in Sun Belt markets, Zillow found. In Texas, more than one-fifth of the market\u2019s value gains since 2020 came from newly built homes, the highest share of any state besides Utah. Florida ranked fourthof all 50 states in its share of market gains from newly built homes.\n\u201cNew construction has created pockets of affordability across the country,\u201d Divounguy said. \u201cThose are markets that create opportunities for people coming in and looking to get on the first rung of the housing ladder.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/08\/business\/us-housing-market-value-zillow","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Lately, they saythat\u2019s begun to change.\nHomes that would have once been flooded with buyer interest are languishing on the market, Lori Harris said.\n\u201cIn years past, we would have packed open houses and then get 15 offers. Now, we sometimes still have packed opens but only get one offer,\u201d she added.\nLA isn\u2019t the only city where the housing market is losing steam. In the years following the pandemic, a fever gripped the housing market: Sellers juggled multiple offers and scarce listings were often bid far above asking.\nNow, that fever looks to be breaking.\nMore homes have comeon the market this year, but buyers aren\u2019t biting the way they used to. Tired of high mortgage rates, surging insurance costs and stubbornly expensive listings, many are sitting on the sidelines. The ones who are interested are taking their time and searching for a good deal, real estate agents told CNN. That shift has weakened sellers\u2019 grip on the housing market and given buyers new leverage.\n\u201cIt feels like buyers are the most cautious they\u2019ve been since the beginning of Covid,\u201d said Brock Harris.\nThere are some signs that the lack of enthusiasm from buyers across the country is translating into softening sales prices.\nMore than one in four home sellers on Zillow cut their asking price in June,accordingto the real estate search engine. That\u2019s the highest share on record for June since at least 2018, Zillow said.\nThe pullback in demand is hitting newly constructed homes, as well. A Mondayreportfrom the National Association of Home Builders said that 66% of housing construction firms employed sales incentives to attract buyers, the highest percentage in the post-Covid period.\nAs is always the case with real estate, location matters. More than 30% of the nation\u2019s largest markets have seen prices dip by at least 1% from recent highs, according to an Augustreportby Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).\nFew places illustrate the housing market\u2019s reversal as starkly as Florida.\nSouth Florida\u2019s housing market took off after the pandemic, fueled by remote workers drawn to sunshine and relaxed Covid restrictions. But over the past two years, the state\u2019s housing market has significantly stalled \u2013 a harbinger of what is now happening in other areas of the country.\n\u201cOverall, I would call this a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Sharon Ross, a real estate agent based in Delray Beach, Florida, said of her area. \u201cWe\u2019ve got heavy inventory.\u201d\nPrice declines in Florida continue to lead all states, ICE found, with 85% of counties in the state showing annual price declines.\nAlong with Florida, Texas has also seen steep price cuts this year, the report found. Parts of California, Arizona, Colorado and Idaho have seen home prices decline by more than 3% from recent highs, according to the report.\nThe slowdown isn\u2019t affecting all areas equally, though. Some areas in the Northeast and Midwest are still seeing prices rise, but at a slower pace than in years past, ICE found.\nRoss said many of the buyers she works with are no longer willing to pay the prices they might have a few years ago, now that home insurance rates and property taxes have climbed so much higher.\nSome sellers in the area have been shocked by lackluster interest in their homes.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had three single-family houses that all canceled their listings because they could not get the price they wanted,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThe challenge is managing their expectations.\u201d\nElevated home prices and stubborn mortgage rates only tell part of the story of the slowdown, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not just a story about mortgage rates and affordability,\u201d Fairweather said. \u201cThere is some hesitancy to make a big financial commitment when there is so much economic uncertainty going on.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade and tariff policies have chipped away at economic growth, while aweaker-than-expected jobs reportlast month has deepened concerns that the slowdown may be sharper than anticipated.\n\u201cIf you lose your job, it can be really scary that you might not be able to find another job that would allow you to keep paying your mortgage,\u201d Fairweather said. \u201cThat may be weighing on the minds of buyers.\u201d\nAnother factor that may be keeping some renters from making the leap into homeownership: The rental market has steadied.\nUntil recently, median rents across the United States had been slipping, easing the pressure on tenants to buy.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a one-bedroom condo versus a one-bedroom apartment, it\u2019s going to be pretty obvious that the monthly payment is going to be a lot lower for the one-bedroom apartment in most places,\u201d Fairweather said.\nHowever, recently, that trend began reversing. The median asking rent rose 1.7% year-over-year in July, the largest jump since January 2023,accordingto Redfin.\nSandy McAlpine, a real estate agent who works in Charlotte, North Carolina, said she\u2019s heard that many would-be buyers are holding back for now, in the hope that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates, making borrowing for a home more affordable.\n\u201cEveryone thinks that the Fed rate cut is when they need to buy,\u201d McAlpine said.\nWhilemortgage rates have been falling in anticipation of an expected rate cut in September, there\u2019sno guaranteeit will come \u2014 and, when the Fed started to cut its interest rates last fall, mortgage rates actuallyrose.\nWhile the Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, its actions can affect the 10-year Treasury yield, the key benchmark that influences home borrowing costs.\nLast week, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.58%, thelowest level in 10 months, according to Freddie Mac.\nFairweather noted that Redfin expects mortgage rates to keep easing next year but cautioned that nothing is certain given the shaky economy. For buyers waiting for the right moment, she said, today\u2019s softer competition could offer a rare opening.\n\u201cThere is this kind of window that buyers didn\u2019t have before, where they are able to negotiate better prices and mortgage rates aren\u2019t as high as they were earlier in the year,\u201d she said. \u201cFor buyers who have been on the sidelines, now might be a good time to take a second look.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/08\/19\/economy\/homebuyers-upper-hand-housing-market","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Hudson\u2019s department store and a skyscraper that will eventually feature high-end condos and a five-star hotel.\nDetroit \u201cwas probably at the bottom of the barrel in this country \u2013 from crime and unemployment to everything in between,\u201d Dan Gilbert, the billionaire who has helped catalyze Detroit\u2019s revival, said in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been a 180-degree comeback.\u201d Gilbert\u2019s real estate company developed the complex at the former Hudson\u2019s, a shopping mecca for generations that closed in 1983.\nDetroit\u2019s population isgrowing for the first time in nearly 60 years. General Motors is moving its headquarters to Hudson\u2019s. JPMorgan is moving there too, having announced a big push to invest $100 million in the city more than a decade ago. On Wednesday, JPMorgan said its investment in Detroit had surpassed $2 billion.\nBut Detroit\u2019s improbable comeback remains incomplete. Its downtown has made a remarkable recovery from the city\u2019s 2013 bankruptcy \u2013 the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history. Meanwhile, some parts of the city have been left behind. Others are still vacant.\nDetroit was once the fourth-largest city in the country, home to America\u2019s automobile industry. In 1950, Detroit\u2019s population topped 1.8 million.\nBy 2013, Detroit\u2019s population had fallen to 700,000.\nNumerous factorshurt Detroitover many years, including a shrinking tax base, high unemployment and poverty, and rising health care and pension costs for city employees. Detroit\u2019s reliance on the auto industry hurt the city as free trade agreements, automation and incentives from southern states sent jobs away.\nPeople with resources also left Detroit for the suburbs. Detroit\u2019s populationdeclinedroughly 28% between 2000 and 2015, while the population in the surrounding six counties grew 3%.\nDetroit\u2019s financial woes led to steep cuts in basic city services like trash pickup and snow plowing. An estimated 40% of street lights werenot functioningby the time Detroit filed for bankruptcy in 2013.\nDuring the financial crisis in 2009, Detroit\u2019s unemployment rateskyrocketed to 29%as the auto industry teetered on the brink of collapse. The average price of a home in Detroit stood at just $7,500.\nAn icon of Detroit\u2019s ruin is now a symbol of Motor City\u2019s economic resurgence\nIn bankruptcy, the state took over control of local government, and a state-appointed manager oversaw city spending and operations. Detroit shed $7 billion in debt and thousands of retired city workers were forced to take pension cuts.\nThe city exited bankruptcy after a year and has rebounded over the past decade, thanks in part to investments from JPMorgan, Gilbert\u2019s Bedrock and other companies and philanthropic organizations.\nGilbert, the co-founder of Rocket Mortgage and owner of the NBA\u2019s Cleveland Cavaliers, went all-in on Detroit when many left the city for dead.\nAfter moving his mortgage lender\u2019s offices downtown, Gilbert went on to buy more than 100 downtown properties, spending $7 billion along the way.\n\u201cWe certainly jump-started it,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cA lot of businesses followed from suburbs and other parts of the country.\u201d\nJPMorgan, which had a long-standing relationship with Detroit, later stepped up its investment in the city in what has become a model for corporate investment in underserved communities.\nLeveraging data and research, JPMorgan\u2019syears-long efforthas helped tens of thousands of Detroiters get apprenticeships or jobs, led to the creation of preservation of thousands of affordable housing units and provided aid to countless small businesses, according to the bank.

The following year, JPMorgan launched avirtual call centerin Detroit.\nIn January, General Motors is scheduled to move its global headquarters to Hudson\u2019s Detroit.

It\u2019s a great time to be here.\u201d\nBut Peter Hammer, a law professor at Wayne State University, said that corporate and philanthropic investments have been concentrated downtown and have not done enough to help the neighborhoods that need it most.\nA reportlast yearcommissioned by the Detroit City Council that private investments downtown \u201chave not lifted the city to share in any levels of prosperity.\u201d\nThe city has experienced an influx of White, Hispanic and Asian residents over the last decade. But Detroit, long a majority Black city, has seen its Black population has decline. Since 2013, the largest loss in population has been among Black residents, with 72,000 fewer over that span.\nThe median income in Detroit is $38,000, half the median income of its broader region. Only 26% of Detroit\u2019s households are middle class, compared to 39% in the region. And 18 out of Detroit\u2019s 139 square miles of land are still vacant, according toDetroit Future City, a nonprofit organization.\nHigh-paying jobs are often held by people who live in the suburbs and commute into Detroit \u2014 while the salaries of Detroit residents, regardless of where they work, arelower. Nearly 70% of Detroit-resident workers traveled outside the city for jobs.\n\u201cOverall, we have seen fairly widespread increases in both housing wealth and income,\u201d said Sam Stragand of the Detroit Partnership on Economic Mobility at the University of Michigan\u2019s Poverty Solutions. \u201cThere are still pockets of the city with little activity in the mortgage market\u201d and lagging areas in housing wealth, home repairs and high vacancies.\nHudson\u2019s opens at a moment of major change in Detroit.

He\u2019d refinance soon, he reasoned.\nHe was wrong.\n\u201cWe always thought they would go down, and fairly quickly,\u201d Dalesandro said of interest rates. \u201cIt has caught us by surprise that it hasn\u2019t come down.\u201d\nAverage mortgage rates in the US have hovered above 6% for nearly three years. Many Americans who bought homes in that time might have expected lower rates and a chance to refinance by now. But so far, relief hasn\u2019t come. Combined with inflation boosting home repair prices, the costs of homeownership are more than many people bargained for.\nDalesandro is one of millions of Americans who locked in a home loan rate above 6% in the years since the Federal Reserve aggressively hiked interest rates from ultra-low levels to tame inflation between 2022 and 2023.\nThe Fed moves sent mortgage rates, which track the 10-year US Treasury yield, on an upward climb.\nSince then, the Fed hascut rates more slowlythan some economists had initially expected, with inflation still running above the bank\u2019s 2% target.\nToday, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, the most popular mortgage loan in America, remains stuck just under 7%. While it\u2019s lower today than it was last summer when Dalesandro purchased his Myrtle Beach home, mortgage rates remain higher than they were at any point between 2008 and 2022.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s recent tariff policiesthreaten to kick up inflation once again, throwing into question how much the Fed will cut interest rates in the near future.\nA higher mortgage rate can add hundreds, even thousands, to a homeowner\u2019s monthly payments. For Dalesandro, who is 77 and retired, his elevated mortgage payment has meant he has had to keep a careful budget.\n\u201cWe just wish we had more expendable income,\u201d he said.\nAngel Scheid, a marketing executive in Los Angeles, purchased her onebedroom, onebathroom home in 2022, when competition in the housing market had hit a fever pitch.\nHomes on the market were fielding multiple offers, sometimes being bid up by hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nScheid bid slightly above the asking price, ultimately purchasing her homefor $915,000, with a 5.99% interest rate.\nAt the time, single-family homes wererarely selling for under $1 millionin Los Angeles, and Scheid\u2019s home required significant repairs, which she said ran over budget amid the 2022inflation surge.\n\u201cI thought I was going to buy it and six months later, I was probably going to refinance,\u201d Scheid said. \u201cI was wildly off.\u201d\nMany financial advisors say refinancing is worth the cost if you can lower your interest rate by at least one percentage point. But Schied no longer expects rates to fall below 5% anytime soon.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any hope on the horizon at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cNow people would be clamoring to get my rate of 5.99%.\u201d\nStill, Scheid said she constantly questions whether she made the right choice buying her home.\nSince Scheid purchased her home in 2022, home prices have softened across the country. Nearly one-third of the largest 100 markets are now showing year-over-year price dips of at least a full percentage point from recent highs, according to a recent analysis from financial services firm Intercontinental Exchange.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at a pretty high monthly payment, and it\u2019ll be a while before I can even consider selling without taking a significant loss,\u201d Scheid said. \u201cI just get this feeling of being trapped.\u201d\n\u201cI should have just stayed renting,\u201d she added.\nEven some homeowners who took out loans before the pandemic are feeling the sting of higher rates.\nJes\u00fas Hern\u00e1ndez didn\u2019t expect interest rates to rise sharply when he took out an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to buy his home in Tucson, Arizona, in 2019.\nUnlike more common fixed-rate mortgages, ARMs can offer short-term relief in the form of lower initial payments. But they come with a catch: After a set introductory period, the interest rate adjusts periodically based on market conditions, and it can climb quickly.\nThese loans have grown more popular in recent years as some buyers bet the Fed will lower rates in the next few years, giving them time to refinance before their ARM resets. In the first quarter of this year, ARMs made up more than a quarter of new conventional mortgages, according to a recentreportfrom the Philadelphia Fed, up from just 7.8% in the first quarter of 2021.\nFor Hern\u00e1ndez, his payments surged after his 2% introductory rate expired.\n\u201cIt was going to go up to 6% or 7%, which would take my payments up by more than a thousand dollars a month,\u201d he said.\nAs his payments climbed and unexpected home repair costs piled up, Hern\u00e1ndez turned to his bank, which eventually agreed to refinance the loan at a 4.35% rate.\nLooking back, Hern\u00e1ndez said he wishes he had chosen a fixed-rate mortgage, even if it would have meant the initial cost was higher. \u201cI went through headaches with the variable rate,\u201d he said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/17\/business\/homebuyers-regrets-mortgage-rates-refinancing","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Against the odds, Gen Z is breaking into the housing market","date":"2025-06-29","body":"Despite daunting market conditions, America\u2019s youngest generation of adults is managing to break into the housing market in growing numbers.\nMembers of Generation Z, the cohort between the ages of 13 and 28, came of age during the economic upheaval of the Covid-19 pandemic.In the years since, home prices have surged and the nation\u2019s housing shortage has deepened \u2014 conditions that risk leading some young adults to give up on the dream of homeownership altogether.\nStill, many in Gen Z are forging ahead with homeownership. The generation now accounts for one in four loans issued to first-time home buyers,accordingto data from financial services company Intercontinental Exchange. And a Redfinreportfrom January 2024 found that Gen Z\u2019s homeownership rate is outpacing that of Millennials and Gen Xers when they were the same age.\nThere\u2019s a growing divide within Gen Z between those with stable jobs or financial support who can afford to buy a home in today\u2019s expensive market, and those who are priced out \u2014 not just of homeownership, but also the rental market, said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Wachter recently authored astudyexploring why there has been a sizable uptick in the number of young adults living with their parents in recent years and found that affordable housing issues disproportionately impact minority groups.\n\u201cThere are difficulties and challenges to buying a home,\u201d Wachter said. \u201cSome of which are more burdensome than on previous generations.\u201d\nStill, CNN spoke with several Gen Zers who recently bought homes and found that their paths to homeownership varied widely. Some received financial help from family, while others did it all on their own. Some carried student loan debt from four-year colleges, while others skipped college altogether.\nWhat they all had in common, though, was the determination to own a home and the discipline to start saving early. Such long-term planning may have been essential for these young buyers to build the wealth necessary to break into today\u2019s high-cost housing market.\nSamantha Garcia, 23, and her fianc\u00e9 recently bought a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home for $335,000 in Redding, a small town in Northern California. She had been setting aside $1,000 per month since 2022 to save up.\nGarcia was willing to move from her home city of Los Angeles to Redding, a more affordable city where she had never lived, to achieve her goal of homeownership.\n\u201cI knew I was never going to buy in LA. There are hardly any single-family homes there for under $1 million,\u201d she said.\nWhen it came time to close on the home, Garcia\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents surprised them with $25,000 toward the down payment.\n\u201cWe actually weren\u2019t expecting them to help,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cBut it will help us keep our savings a little bit more afloat.\u201d\nAdriana Moorman opted out of attending a traditional four-year college, instead finding steady work in human resources.\nAt 21, she was debt-free and had been saving up to buy a home since high school. Aside from a small inheritance she said was worth a few thousand dollars, she was able to secure a $202,000 Baltimore condo on her own.\n\u201cI think I lucked out by being financially aware at such a young age,\u201d Moorman said.\nEmily Blaylock, a real estate agent in St. Louis, said the post-pandemic rise of hybrid andremotework has meant that more Gen Zers are willing to move further into the suburbs, away from city centers. She said she often works with buyers in their 20s, due to the relative affordability of her city.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true overall with all age groups right now, but especially with younger people, they\u2019re OK with driving 25 minutes to downtown to get something they can live in comfortably and affordably,\u201d Blaylock said. \u201cA lot of young people don\u2019t have to go into the office five days a week, so we\u2019re seeing more people spread outside the St. Louis radius.\u201d\nDominic Azpeitia, 26, was willing to move away from home to achieve homeownership. Although he hopes to return to Southern California one day to be near his family, he moved to Phoenix for its more affordable cost of living.\nAzpeitia said he and his wife had been casually looking for the past few years and began to notice the rapid rise in home prices.\n\u201cI just decided last year, there is no point in waiting anymore,\u201d Azpeitia said. \u201cIn my opinion, housing prices aren\u2019t going to go down.\u201d\nAzpeitia said that while he had saved the money for a down payment, he worked out a deal with his lender and the home seller that meant he didn\u2019t have to pay any money towards the down payment or closing costs.\nHe said he sees his Phoenix home, which was purchased for $520,000, as a long-term investment and that he hopes to rent it out to tenants in a few years.\nWhile the housing market has been exceptionally tight for the last few years, there have been signs it may be softening. Ananalysis released last monthby Redfin found that home sellers now vastly outnumber buyers, an early indication that negotiating power may be shifting back into buyers\u2019 hands.\nSome young Americans are taking advantage of that shift.\nRylee Arnold, 28, recently purchased a home in Salt Lake City and was pleasantly surprised when her seller offered to cover many of the closing costs.\n\u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to purchase the house if the seller hadn\u2019t given me so many credits toward the house,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThey kept fixing things for me too.

{"title":"There\u2019s no \u2018material inflation from tariffs,\u2019 says new central banker Stephen Miran","date":"2025-09-19","body":"President Donald Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs aren\u2019t boosting inflation, so interest rates should be lowered quickly to prevent America\u2019s labor market from deteriorating, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran said Friday in his first public comments as a monetary policymaker.\nThe Fed on Wednesday announceda quarter-point rate cut, the first reduction in nine months, in an attempt to prevent unemployment from surging. Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a news conference described it as a \u201crisk management cut,\u201d suggesting the Fed isn\u2019t behind the curve.\nMiran, however, disagrees. He was the lone dissenter on the Fed\u2019s latest decision, favoring a large, half-point cut instead. His appointment has brought a new voice to the Fed \u2014 one with unconventional views on the economy \u2014 in support of aggressive rate cuts in the months ahead.\nIn an interview with CNBC Friday morning, Miran played the down the potential impact from Trump\u2019s tariffs, basing that as his main argument for why he backed a half-point cut, while mentioning the precarious state of the job market.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any material inflation from tariffs,\u201d Miran said, adding that the longer that borrowing costs \u201cstay very restrictive\u201d means \u201cthe greater the risks build up\u2026 to the employment mandate.\u201d\nMiran, Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, was sworn in an hour before the Fed\u2019s meeting began on Tuesday, he told CNBC, after Republicans swiftly shepherded his confirmation.\nWhenever a Fed governor dissents, they typically release a statement through the central bank two days later laying out their rationale, but Miran is choosing to detail his reasoning at an upcoming speech in New York on Monday.\nThe newly appointed Fed governor is getting settled in, he said, telling CNBC: \u201cI literally just got here a few days ago.\u201d\nMiran said that Trump called him the day he was sworn in to congratulate him, adding that the president didn\u2019t ask him to \u201ccommit to doing any particular actions.\u201d Miran reiterated that he will form independent opinions about the economy.\n\u201cEverybody was extremely welcoming\u201d at the Fed after he was sworn in, Miran said, despite the unprecedented pressure Trump continues to exert on the central bank, including an ongoing push to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook.\n\u201cIt was a very collegial environment, and I really appreciated that, and that includes Governor Cook,\u201d Miran said.\nPowell dodges question about Lisa Cook mortgage fraud allegations\nOn Monday, Miran is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech at a luncheon hosted by the Economic Club of New York, during which he will \u201cgive a full accounting for my economic views and walk through in meticulous detail the economics and the arithmetic behind getting to those numbers.\u201d\nWhen Fed officials releasedtheir latest so-called dot ploton Wednesday \u2014 a graph of their projections for their benchmark lending rate in the coming years \u2014 there was one projection that was far below the other estimates for 2025, suggesting that person estimates aggressive rate cuts by the end of the year. Miran confirmed that dot was his.\n\u201cThat was me,\u201d he said.\nBy many measures, America\u2019s labor market has weakened since the beginning of the year.\nJob growth has beenanemic; there are nowmore unemployed people seeking workthan there are job openings; and in August, the number of people unemployed for more than 26 weeks reached its highest level since November 2021.\nBut those signs ultimately weren\u2019t enough to prompt the Fed to deliver the half-point cut Miran voted for. Powell told reporters that while the labor market has softened, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom.\n\u201cLet\u2019s remember though, the unemployment rate\u2019s 4.3%. The economy is growing at 1.5%. So it\u2019s not a bad economy, or anything like that,\u201d Powell said \u201cWe\u2019ve seen much more challenging economic times.\u201d\nTakeaways: If you\u2019re confused about what\u2019s next for the US economy, so is the Fed\nPowell has frequently referred to the importance of the unemployment rate in policymakers\u2019 perception of the labor market. Last year when the Fed delivered a large, half-point cut, it was mostly in response to the fast increase in unemployment over a short period of time.\nThat\u2019s not the case this time around. Since January, the unemployment rate has remained within a narrow range between 4% and 4.3%.\nBut the Fed chief on Wednesday warned that if layoffs do start to pick up, those people who would find themselves out of a job will likely struggle to find work.\n\u201cThe concern is that if you start to see layoffs, there won\u2019t be a lot of hiring going on,\u201d Powell said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/19\/economy\/fed-stephen-miran-dissent","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Here\u2019s how Trump\u2019s \u2018big beautiful bill\u2019 would impact housing","date":"2025-06-16","body":"Americans face a shortage of affordable homes, but the mega tax and spending bill championed by the Trump administration has the potential to shape housing affordability for years to come.\nThe \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d Act, a linchpin of President Donald Trump\u2019s economic agenda, is primarily a sweeping tax overhaul, intended to make the 2017 tax cuts passed during Trump\u2019s first administration permanent. The version passed by House Republicans last month, now being deliberated in the Senate,would also push more Americans off Medicaidand food assistance, according to multiple assessments. The bill is also estimated to add trillions of dollars to the national debt over the next decade.\nBut tucked inside the bill\u2019s more than 1,000 pages are a set of housing-related tax changes that could expand affordable housing and deliver new tax breaks to homeowners in higher-cost states. Critics, however, warn the bill may also tilt the playing field in favor of wealthy buyers and powerful landlords, particularly through a provision that blocks local governments from regulating rent-setting algorithms for the next decade.\n\u201cBroadly speaking, this is not intended to be a housing bill,\u201d said Andy Winkler, the director of the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s housing and infrastructure projects. \u201cBut there are several provisions that, if they do get enacted, could affect housing supply, preservation and affordability.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what you should know about how the bill may affect housing:\nAmerica\u2019s home affordability woes are partially driven by ashortage of available homesfor sale, which has driven up costs. A Zillowanalysisestimated America was short 4.5 million homes in 2022.\nTrump\u2019s \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d includes provisions designed to address the shortage of low-income and moderate-income housing at a time when nearly half of American households spendmore than 30% of their incomeon rent or mortgage payments, falling under the US Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019sdefinition of \u201ccost-burdened.\u201d\nThe House version of the bill extends and expands the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), a federal program that incentivizes private investors to develop affordable rental housing for low-income tenants.\nThe bill restores and extends a temporary 12.5% increase in LIHTC allocations through 2029 and lowers the amount of government-issued bonds that developers are required to use to qualify for federal tax credits to build affordable housing.\nNovogradac, an accounting firm that provides services for developers,estimatesthat 527,700 additional affordable rental homes could be financed between 2026 and 2035 if these provisions were to become law.\n\u201cThe bill would have a decent impact on housing supply,\u201d Winkler said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of interest in the Senate in doing more than what the House-passed version of the bill does for housing.\u201d\n\u201cBut they\u2019re already having to walk a pretty tight rope to balance the cost of these expiring tax credits, not impact deficits too much and keep costs down to be able to have the bill move forward,\u201d Winkler added.\nThe bill also raises the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, which allows taxpayers to deduct what they paid in state and local taxes \u2014 like income taxes and property taxes \u2014 from their federal tax bill. Under the 2017 Trump tax law, the deduction was capped at $10,000, no matter how much was paid. Under the House version of the new tax bill, that deduction would be raised to $40,000, allowing homeowners in high-tax states like New York and California to deduct more of their property taxes.\nJim Tobin, the CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, said the LIHTC and SALT deduction expansions, along with increased tax benefits for small businesses, would be beneficial to homebuilders.\n\u201cWe believe the bill will provide certainty in taxation for most individuals that are needed to usher in continued economic growth at a time when the housing industry desperately needs it,\u201d Tobin told CNN.\nOne provision buried in the House\u2019s version of the bill would block states from regulating artificial intelligence models or automated decision systems. If that provision were to remain in the final bill, it would be a victory for companies that provide rent-setting algorithms to landlords.\nOne of the best-known of these companies, Texas-based RealPage, which uses non-public rent data from landlords to train its algorithms and create pricing recommendations, is facinglegal challenges and potential regulationfrom at least eight states. The GOP tax bill would effectively put an end to the potential regulation.\nLast month, a group of 40 state attorneys general signed a letter asking Congress to reject the measure.\n\u201cThe impact of such a broad moratorium would be sweeping and wholly destructive of reasonable state efforts to prevent known harms associated with AI,\u201d the letterread, directly citing states\u2019 efforts to \u201cprotect renters when algorithms are used to set rent.\u201d\nThe housing provisions are a small part of the overall bill, which, overall, wouldadd $2.4 trillion to the debtover the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analysis.\nAmericans will feel that growing mountain of debtin the form of higher interest rates, economists warn.\nWhen the government has a lot of debt, it needs to borrow money to keep paying the bills by selling Treasury bonds. If investors believe the government is more leveraged, they will demand higher interest rates to compensate for the risk of their investment.\nThough it may seem like an overly broad financial concept, those higher interest rates affect housing in the form of higher mortgage rates and higher borrowing rates for homebuilders, which can then translate to higher costs for new construction.\nAt a time when average mortgage rates are hovering near 7%, a further rise in borrowing costs would make homeownership more difficult for some Americans.\n\u201cWe care quite a lot about higher interest rates in the housing world,\u201d Winkler said. \u201cIt means people buying fewer homes and people being able to build fewer homes.\u201d\n\u201cSome of these broader impacts are just as important, if not more important than some of the specific housing provisions,\u201d he added.\nThe White House\u2019s plan to curb government spending could do even more damage to housing affordability.\nLast month, the White House released its budget proposal for 2026. It included steep cuts to housing and community development programs.\nDavid Dworkin, the president of the National Housing Conference, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing solutions, told CNN that he is hopeful Congress will not agree to cut housing programs suggested by the White House.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s budget is an opening proposal,\u201d Dworkin said. Trump\u201cput out an executive order addressing the issue of housing affordability on Day 1 and we support that emphasis. We disagree with the budget proposals around housing, and we look forward to reconciling that with the administration.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/16\/business\/trump-big-beautiful-tax-bill-housing-impact","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Home sellers now outnumber buyers by largest margin in 12 years, report finds","date":"2025-05-29","body":"After years of bidding wars and climbing home prices, the balance of power in the housing market may finally be shifting.\nHome sellers now vastly outnumber buyers in the US, according to ananalysisreleased Thursday from real estate company Redfin. The report found that there were nearly 500,000 more home sellers in the market than buyers as of April, the largest gap between the two groups since Redfin began compiling the data in 2013.\nThe data is an early indication that the US housing market may be experiencing a slowdown \u2014 not because home prices nationally are becoming more affordable, but because there are fewer buyers. It\u2019s the latest sign that a long-building affordability crisis, now compounded by trade tensions and recession fears, may be finally catching up with the housing market.\nDespite the recent drop-off in demand for new homes, prices have continued to rise. The median existing home sales price rose 1.8% year-over-year in April to $414,000, according to data released by the National Association of Realtors last week. That\u2019san all-time high for the month of Apriland the 22nd consecutive month of year-over-year price increases.\nAt the same time, elevated mortgage rates are contributing to the monthly expenses that new borrowers incur when purchasing a new home. The average rate on a standard 30-year fixed mortgage, the most popular type of home loan, is currently hovering just under 7% and threatens to go even higher amidunrest in the bond market.\nRelated articleTrump\u2019s tariffs are dragging down an already stalled housing market\nIn addition to the high cost of purchasing a new home, consumers are grappling with rising economic uncertainty, which is fueled in part by swings in the stock and bond markets and the threat of tariff-induced inflation.As a result, home shoppers are even more cautious this spring,during what is usually the peak demand season in the real estate world.\nAccording to a survey released Wednesday by Bank of America, 75% of prospective homebuyers are waiting for home prices and interest rates to fall.\nAccording to Redfin, there haven\u2019t been this many homes for sale since March 2020. And there haven\u2019t been so few buyers at any point since Redfin began keeping track in 2013 \u2013 with the exception of April 2020, when the housing market ground to a halt at the start of the pandemic.\nTo estimate the number of buyers, Redfin created a model using internal data on pending home sales and the average time it takes from a buyer\u2019s first tour to when they purchase a home.\nKaren Pohl, a real estate agent in Las Vegas, told CNN that she has felt the market shift in favor of buyers in recent months.\n\u201cBased upon previous spring selling seasons, I have noticed a lot of listings are sitting longer on the marketplace (this year),\u201d Pohl said. \u201cI think there are a lot of sellers who still have really ambitious pricing for their homes, and it may be time to get realistic with their pricing in order to be competitive in the marketplace.\u201d\nPohl said she has started to see more sellers offering concessions or price cuts on their homes.\nThe days of multiple offers above a home\u2019s asking price and rapidly rising home prices that defined the post-pandemic housing demand boom may now be in the rearview mirror for many cities across the US. Although home prices are still climbing, Redfin\u2019s head of economics research, Chen Zhao, told CNN that the company estimates a 1% drop in home prices by the end of this year.\n\u201cGenerally, the ratio of sellers to buyers seems to be a predictor for home price growth, but with a lag of about three to six months,\u201d Zhao said.\n\u201cThe reason we think home prices will fall by 1% and not something larger is because it\u2019s actually very hard for home prices to fall, unless sellers have to sell,\u201d she added. \u201cSellers can always decide they don\u2019t like the prices that are currently in the market and decide to stay in their home.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/29\/business\/home-sellers-market-redfin-report","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The housing market has shifted in favor of buyers \u2014 depending on where you live","date":"2025-03-03","body":"Americans looking to purchase a home in certain US cities might be pleasantly surprised to find the tide is shifting their way this spring after years of challenging affordability.\nThere were 3.7 months of for-sale supply on the market in January, the most in six years, according to a recent Redfin analysis. That means it would take more than three months to sell all the homes that were listed for sale in January, given monthly average sales volume.\nThe findings point to a housing market where sellers are slowly losing leverage after years of having the upper hand. Generally, more than four months of supply sitting on the market indicates a full-tilt buyers\u2019 market.\nSpring has long been considered the busiest home shopping season in America as warmer temperatures and the end of the school year tend to entice new buyers and sellers into the market. However, persistently high borrowing costs andfew new home listingsstymied the action last year: Home salesfell to the lowest levelin three decades in 2024.\nThough mortgage rates remainsimilarly elevatedheading into the busy season this year, determined buyers so far face less competition and have more options, according to recent data.\nAn unusually high number of homes have been pulled from sale recently, a sign that many home sellers are no longer fielding multiple competitive offers. Data from CoreLogic found that 7.6% of homes on the market were delisted in January \u2014 the highest level in over a decade.\n\u201cWhen some sellers notice that buyers are asking for more concessions or there\u2019s softening demand, they may decide to delist and wait,\u201d Hepp said.\nAs the famous saying goes, location is everything when it comes to real estate.\nHome shoppers in southeast Florida have the most buying power of anywhere else in the country. In cities like Cape Coral and Miami, there are more than 11 months of home supply on the market, according to Redfin. Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach and Jacksonville are also strong buyers\u2019 markets.\n\u201cThere were winners and losers during the pandemic years, and Florida was a clear winner,\u201d Jeremy Guillette, a Realtor who works in the southeast Florida area said. The state saw an influx of residents during the early years of the Covid-19 pandemic, causing intense competition for homes for sale.\n\u201cNow the market is totally different. There is definitely a lot more power as a buyer right now,\u201d Guillette said.\nFlorida ended January with 172,209 homes for sale, the highest level since Redfin began recording the data in 2012.\nThere are a number of possible reasons for slacking interest from buyers, in Florida and across the country.\nIn addition to elevated mortgage rates, there has also been a rise in costs associated with home ownership.\nAs home prices across the country have climbed, so too have property taxes. Property taxes for a single-family home jumped 5.1% from 2023 to 2024, according to CoreLogic.\nBut homeowners across Florida, Texas and Louisiana \u2014 states that are particularly vulnerable to intense, climate change-fueledhurricanes and floods\u00ad\u2014 face an additional cost in the form of skyrocketinghome insurance premiums.\nIn order to find interested buyers in recent months, some home sellers on Florida\u2019s coasts have offered to help cover buyers\u2019 closing costs and pay for their home repairs, Guillette said. \u201cSellers haven\u2019t had to do that in years,\u201d he added.\nWhile buyers in states like Florida, Texas, and Louisiana may have plenty of options when shopping for a home this spring, intense competition hasn\u2019t abated since the pandemic-era home demand rush in many cities concentratedin the country\u2019s Northeast.\nWhen Betsy Ambrose sold her home outside of Rochester, New York, in 2021, she expected to quickly find a new one with a shorter commute to her husband\u2019s job. Instead, her family is still renting a temporary home four years later, waiting for a home to hit the market at a price point they can afford.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been tremendously frustrated trying to wait out some kind of a course correction, or at least price drops of any kind,\u201d Ambrose said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not coming.\u201d\n\u201cWe finally started bidding on houses last year and we just can\u2019t compete with the level of offers coming through,\u201d she added.\nRochester had just one month of supply on the market in January, making it the city that most strongly favors home sellers of the 100 most populous metro areas in the US. Buffalo, New York, and Hartford, Connecticut, follow with just over a month of supply.\n\u201cI want to buy a house this year, but I just don\u2019t see it being possible,\u201d Ambrose said. \u201cIf I had known it would be this hard, I would have never sold my house.

{"title":"US home sales in 2024 fell to lowest level since 1995","date":"2025-01-24","body":"Sales of existing homes in the US fell last year to the lowest level in almost three decades, as sky-high home prices and elevated mortgage rates squeezed home buyers.\nSales of previously owned homes, which make up the vast majority of the market, totaled 4.06 million in 2024, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. That\u2019s the lowest level since 1995 and slightly below 2023\u2019s similarly anemic levels.\nThe average rate on a conventional, 30-year fixed mortgage reached a peak of 7.22% last year. After briefly slipping to nearly 6%, it has ratcheted up in recent weeks,reaching 7.04% last weekand ticking down to 6.96% this week, according to Freddie Mac.\nThe median price of an existing home, meanwhile, has climbed for 18 months straight, reaching a record high of $407,500 in 2024. In December, the median price was $404,400.\nDespite the tough conditions for buyers, there was some momentum toward the end of 2024, with existing-home sales rising 2.2% in December from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.24 million, the fastest pace since February 2024.\n\u201cHome sales in the final months of the year showed solid recovery despite elevated mortgage rates,\u201d said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun in a release. \u201cConsumers clearly understand the long-term benefits of homeownership. Job and wage gains, along with increased inventory, are positively impacting the market.\u201d\nThe US housing market might not improve much for buyers this year.\nMortgage rates are expected to remain above 6% through 2026. Mortgage rates were also high in the 1980s, but home prices were much lower back then. Buyers nowadays are contending with home prices that continue to hover near unprecedented highs.\nAnd in some markets, homeowners are also dealing with skyrocketing home insurance premiums. That isn\u2019t expected to change this year.\nAnother longstanding issue for housing affordability is a persistent lack of homes on the market. Total housing inventory improved throughout 2024, but supply isn\u2019t anywhere close to keeping up with demand.\nThere is a housing shortage of 3.7 million units, according to a recent Freddie Mac estimate. In December, inventory stood at 1.15 million units, down 13.5% from November but up 16.2% from a year earlier.\nOne big reason for the undersupply is the so-called lock-in effect, where some homeowners who locked in a low mortgage rate before the Federal Reserve began to hike interest rates in 2022 prefer to not sell, as they would need to take on a mortgage with a much higher rate if they bought another home.\nHowever, some did sell last year because of life events such as marriage, divorce or new children, contributing to last year\u2019s steady uptick in housing inventory. The problem for this year is that homeownersdon\u2019t have much of an incentiveto sell.\nHigh borrowing costs also weighed on homebuilding last year, but there\u2019s a sense of optimism among builders that deregulation could boost the supply of homes this year, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\nScott Turner, who is President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to helm the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, said during his confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill that he\u2019s committed to reviewing and cutting down on regulation. Since the Fed is expected to cut interest ratesonly a few times this year, deregulation could play a role in easing pressure in the housing market.\nBut slashing regulations would likely not be enough to offset some of the Trump administration\u2019s promises of tariffs and mass deportations, which could add to the cost of building new homes.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/24\/economy\/us-home-sales-worst-year-in-three-decades","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Homeowners have no incentive to sell. Here\u2019s why","date":"2024-12-30","body":"This year, America\u2019s once-in-a-generation housing slump deepened \u2014 but 2025 may not see much improvement. That\u2019s partly becauseAmericans who locked inultra-low mortgage rates during the pandemic have little incentive to move into new homes and take on higher borrowing costs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming into 2025 with a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d said Skylar Olsen, Zillow\u2019s chief economist. \u201cI think the difficulties of next year are going to be pretty similar to the difficulties of last year.\u201d\nIn 2024, Americans who bought homes wereolder and richer than ever. That\u2019s because buying a home has grown more difficult amid a lack of affordable options. The median existing-home sales price was $406,100 in November, the 17th consecutive month of year-over-year price increases, according to the National Association of Realtors. In November 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic, the median sales price was $274,000, according to NAR. The significant jump in home prices made homeownersricher on paper.\nMeanwhile, rents have also risen, making it increasingly difficult for renters to save money for a down payment. Nearly half of all renterspaid more than 30%of their income toward housing costs, according to the US Census Bureau. Homelessness also hita record high in 2024, driven in part by a lack of affordable housing, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nHomeowners have faced financial pressures of their own this year. Those who live in areas vulnerable to natural disasters have seen theirhome insurance premiums skyrocket, and inflation has caused the cost of home repairs to rise.\nBorrowing costs play a major role in housing affordability, as well. A few months ago, economists had predicted that mortgage rates would fall below 6% by the end of the year. But this month,the Federal Reserve signaledthat it may only cut interest rates twice next year, fewer times than expected. That has caused mortgage rates, which track the 10-year US Treasury yield, to climb higher: The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.85% last week, up from 6.61% this time last year, according to data from Freddie Mac.\nOlsen said Zillow expects mortgage rates to stay above 6% for all of 2025, ending the year at around 6.2%.\nIt may be mixed news for house hunters next year. Here\u2019s what economists expect of the housing market in 2025:\nThe US housing market is on track for its worst sales year in nearly three decades, according to NAR data.\nA Septemberreportfrom the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated that nearly 60% of the 50.8 million active mortgages had interest rates below 4%. The difference between a 4% mortgage rate and a 6% rate could equate to thousands of dollars a year in savings for the median homebuyer.\nStill, Chen Zhao, an economist at Redfin, said she expects a slow easing of rate pressures in 2025.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s mostly still going to be a trend in 2025,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as time goes on, people\u2019s reasons for moving accumulate and they get unlocked by necessity.\u201d\nMajor life events like having children or getting a job in a new city will require more people to put their homes for sale and move, even if it means giving up a sub-4% mortgage rate, she said.\nThis year, existing-home sale prices continually hit record highs, according to NAR data.\nThat haspadded the pocketsof Americans who already own homes, adding $5 trillion in household equity since the pandemic, said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist.\nMore than a decade ofchronic underbuilding\u2014 combined with more millennials, America\u2019s largest generation, reaching the average age of homeownership \u2014 has caused demand to greatly outstrip supply. Those trends will likely persist in 2025, meaning that home prices will likely continue their upward ascent.\nHowever, home price growth may slow, said Olsen.\n\u201cThere have been more homes lingering on the market, and those homes will likely need price cuts,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s become more of a buyer\u2019s market this year than the past two or three home-shopping seasons, when we were experiencing crazy home demand.\u201d\nLocation also matters, Olsen said, with homebuyers in Southern states likely to see steeper home price cuts than in other markets.\nAnew set of rulesgoverning how NAR members do business in the US officially took effect in August. Many experts predicted the rules would eventually do away with the 5% to 6% standard commission paid out by a home\u2019s seller. NAR has said its commissions were always negotiable, but critics argued that these commissions had been baked into home listing prices, artificially inflating them.\nHome prices have continued climbing since the new rules have taken effect, though next year will see the first spring buying season with the new rules in place. It isn\u2019t clear how much will change for homebuyers, Zhao said.\n\u201cSo far there hasn\u2019t been a ton of evidence that commissions have come down,\u201d Zhao said.\nAny commission change would most likely occur in the higher-end luxury home space, where Realtors get paid a percentage of a home\u2019s sale and can command hundreds of thousands of dollars in commission, Zhao said.\nThe US government can also pass legislation to help ease the burden of housing costs, something both Democrats and Republicansdiscussedon the 2024 campaign trail.\nJaret Seiberg, a financial policy analyst at TD Cowen, has argued that Republican lawmakers may try to increase the availability of affordable housing through tax credits during President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s upcoming administration.\n\u201cWe expect housing to be a top political issue over the next two years,\u201d Seiberg wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. \u201cOur view is the GOP will need to address entry-level housing inflation in order to win future elections. This is why tax credit programs to boost construction are in play\u201d\nHowever, Trump\u2019sthreats to place hefty tariffson some of America\u2019s largest trading partners, including China, Canada, Mexicoand the European Union, could backfire on the housing market, Zhao said.\n\u201cIf he does implement broad based tariffs, that means (mortgage) rates will have to stay high for one main reason, which is that you would expect some inflationary pressure,\u201d she said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2024\/12\/30\/economy\/what-to-expect-housing-market-2025","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Economic warning sign: Holiday jobs are tougher to find","date":"2025-12-02","body":"Store workers may not be quite as helpful this holiday shopping season. That\u2019s a potentially worrying sign for the economy.\nRetailers typically load up on temporary staff in the final months of the year to help contend with the holiday rush. But the National Retail Federation forecasts a sharp drop in holiday help compared to last year. Stores are expected to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers in 2025, down sharply from the 442,000 they hired last year, according to a survey of members. That\u2019s a drop of as much as 40%.\nThat may be surprising considering early holiday sales are booming: Black Friday sales rose more than 4% from last year, and Cyber Monday sales were up 7% from 2024, according to Adobe Analytics. For the holiday shopping season as a whole, the NRF forecasts sales will rise between 3.7% to 4.2%, topping $1 trillion.\nBut a significant part of those sales increases are being driven byhigher prices, not shoppers buying more items. For example, Salesforce found that Black Friday prices surged 7%, but shopping volume fell 1% \u2013 leading to a 4% gain in sales. So shoppers are paying more while buying less \u2013 requiring fewer employees to help customers.\nConsumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of America\u2019s gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy. Butconsumer confidenceis at an historic low andunemployment is startingto creep higher. So a sharp drop in seasonal hiring is coming at a precarious time and portends more economic uncertainty going into the new year.\nMany retailers are taking a cautious approach to staffing this holiday season, said Mark Mathews, chief economist of the group.\n\u201cI think the uncertainty that we\u2019ve seen in the economy and the retail businesses over the course of the year has led some retailers to sit on the sidelines a little bit when it comes to making some of these hiring decisions, because this is not a normal year from a historical perspective,\u201d he said.\nMathews also said that fewer regular workers are quitting jobs compared to past years, so retailers are going into the holiday season with better staffing levels than many past years. The most recent Labor Department figures show 70,000 more retail workers than a year earlier, although that\u2019s only a 0.5% increase.\nSome major retailers, such as Walmart and Target, say they\u2019re getting by giving more hours to permanent workers rather than bringing on as much seasonal help. Both of those big box retailers say they will be hiring some seasonal help, although neither will give hiring goals for those workers.\nOther outside groups are also reporting drops in seasonal hiring plans.\nOutplacement firm Challenger Gray and Christmas says its survey found the lowest level of seasonal hiring since the Great Recession year of 2009, even lower than the temporary help brought into stores at the end of the first year of the pandemic.\n\u201cWe have been seeing a pretty consistent story of cooling in the labor market for a year and a half, two years,\u201d said Andy Challenger, senior vice president of the firm. He said one factor that could be driving some of the reduced need for hiring, especially in warehouses, is an increase in automation, partly in response to labor shortages that employers were reporting just a few years ago.\nThe low level of hiring is causing those who are used to finding seasonal jobs to help with their household budgets to scramble to find the available positions. Job search site Indeed.com said that searches on the site for seasonal jobs are up 50% since 2023.\n\u201cThe number of searches for seasonal work is really skyrocketed the last two years,\u201d said Cory Stahle, senior economist for Indeed. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in this seasonal hiring market is really reflective of what we\u2019re seeing in the broader labor market, which is the market has cooled and then our fewer opportunities now than there were a few years ago for people.\u201d\nThe government jobs numbers, while delayed by the government shutdown, back that up. The most recent report for September showed a rise in unemployment to 4.4%, the highest rate in four years, and job losses in August under a revised reading. Full year jobs growth for the year is slated to be the worst since the job losses of 2020 and the Great Recession.\nThere could still be some pick-up in holiday hiring, NRF\u2019s Mathews said. The uncertainty that many retailers had going into the holiday period could be overcome by stronger than expected sales, and some late hiring.\n\u201cIt may be that because we\u2019ve had a relatively robust Black Friday weekend, some of those retailers who may have been sitting on the side lines saying, \u2018You know what, the last minute, we need to go out there and start hiring more,\u2019\u201d said Mathews. \u201cin some cases, retailers may have been a little bit more conservative, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t step up now and begin to add people as they need to arises.\u201d\n\u2013 CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/02\/business\/holiday-hiring-seasonal-temporary-workers-retail","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"What to expect in Thursday\u2019s jobs report","date":"2025-11-19","body":"One of the most hotly anticipated economic reports is finally set to be released Thursday: the long-delayed jobs report for September, originally due on October 3. It lands as the floodgates open for a slew of backlogged economic data that was held up due to the historic government shutdown.\nSitting on the shelf for six weeks, the months-old data has the potential to come across as stale \u2013 especially for a fast-moving economy that isfeeling increasingly perilousfor many Americans andbusinesses.\nEconomic uncertainty and the rising cost of living have caused consumers to pull back (asThe Home DepotandTargetcan attest). Affordability concerns are reaching a fever pitch (so much so that President Donald Trumpexempted some grocery store itemslike coffee, beef and fruit from steep tariffs).\nHowever, the end of the federal data drought provides a much-needed look at how the economy fared in recent weeks and what\u2019s in store for the months to come.\nPlus, Thursday\u2019s report might very well be the last clean jobs report for a couple of months, since theshutdown mucked up the finely tuned process of data collection and analysis during Octoberand part of November.\nAnd on Wednesday we learned that some of that October jobs data \u2013 the payroll numbers from the establishment survey \u2013 will be included with the November jobs report that\u2019s pushed back to December 16, from December 5. The household survey data was not able to be collected, BLS said.\nAs such, Thursday\u2019s jobs report will provide a critical baseline of the US labor market entering the fourth quarter.\nEconomists are expecting 50,000 jobs were added in September and that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.3%, according to FactSet. The consensus estimates would mark a pickup fromAugust\u2019s preliminary 22,000-job gain.\nThe government is back open. Here\u2019s what that means for economic data\nIf September job gains come in as expected at 50,000, they will keep this year on course for the weakest employment growth since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Financial Crisis.\n\u201cI\u2019m not expecting huge changes in the (September) report, relative to past reports,\u201d said Allison Shrivastava, economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. \u201cI really just expect this continuation of this anemic job market that we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been a low-hire, low-fire slog of a labor market where the lion\u2019s share of job gains has occurred in health care and social services.\nThat trend was largely confirmed by ahost of private sectorlabor market data released during the shutdown.\nStill, while economists aren\u2019t expecting many surprises, Thursday\u2019s report doesn\u2019t come without some fairly big risks \u2013 especially for the consideration of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates by a quarter point on October 29 with a backdrop of a \u201cless dynamic and somewhat softer labor market,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the time.\n\u201cAnything that looks kind of ugly now has had the potential to fester for a little bit longer, for the six weeks before we got a better eye on it,\u201d Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told CNN.\nJob growth was expected to slow following the post-pandemic economic recovery; however, it\u2019s beenpractically listlessthe past several months. Since May, job gains have averaged 31,000 per month, which is about one-fifth of the average seen in 2024, BLS data shows.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this place of such uncertainty because there\u2019s so much change in policy,\u201d Shrivastava said, noting the frequently changing tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration.\nThe economy has continued to expand in recent months and consumer spending has held up; however, it\u2019s wealthier Americans who are propping up those outlays.\n\u201cThis is already a pretty precarious spending situation that could really topple,\u201d she said.\nThe bifurcation (also widely known asK-shapedor two-lane) in the spending environment has further contributed to the bifurcation in the labor market. Aside from health care, social services and leisure and hospitality (to some extent), job gains have been flat or negative in many industries, she said.\nIn addition to uncertainty around trade policy, factors such as immigration, artificial intelligence, federal employment and funding cuts, high interest rates and pandemic-era overhiring are serving as headwinds, she said.\nAnd that in turn, will continue to put downward pressure on wages and serve as barriers for people trying to break into or re-enter the labor market, she said.\nContinuing jobless claims, which are submitted by people who have filed for at least a week or more of unemployment, have been hovering at around four-year highs, Department of Labor data shows. The latest claims data, which was filled in partially this week, showed that continuing claims were 1.957 million as of October 18, the highest since August.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a precarious place, we\u2019re in an anemic place, but not necessarily something wholly negative,\u201d Shrivastava said.\nStill, layoff activity hasn\u2019t worrisomely accelerated: First-time claims for unemployment benefits were 232,000 as of October 18, a tally that was in line with September.\nIf claims are \u201cin the order of, 300,000 to 400,000 and once we kind of are consistently above that level, then I\u2019d start to be a little more worried about the job market in general,\u201d Oren Klachkin, financial market economist at Nationwide, told CNN.\nAt this point, Klachkin and other Nationwide economists \u201cdon\u2019t see a recession on the horizon anytime soon.\u201d\n\u201cIf I had to put a metaphor around it, it\u2019s like we\u2019re at the end stages of a marathon for the labor market,\u201d Klachkin said. \u201cWe came out of the pandemic with extremely robust gains in job growth, and now we\u2019re reaching the end stages of this so-called race, where the job market is looking a bit softer, a bit slower and is potentially at risk, just given where we are in the cycle.\u201d\nThe labor market is vulnerable to a crash-out; however, the odds are still in favor of it trudging across the finish line and to a point where it could get refueled early next year by increased certainty around tariff rates as well as a potential fiscal boost from the tax and spending bill.\n\u201cIn the earnings results for the third quarter, the corporate sector is still essentially signaling that we can be relatively upbeat about the economy into next year,\u201d Klachkin said.\nThis story was updated to include additional developments.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/19\/economy\/us-jobs-report-september-preview","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The US economy lost 32,000 private-sector jobs in September","date":"2025-10-01","body":"Private payrolls plunged in September, complicating the picture for the US economy as policymakers and investors struggle to assess the state of the labor market amida government shutdown.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is unlikely to release the monthly jobs report this Friday due to the closure. That means many flying blind without critical economic data are having to key into any information they can get, including Wednesday\u2019s private sector jobs data from payroll company ADP.\nUS private-sector businesses lost 32,000 jobs in September, according to the report. August\u2019s previously estimated 54,000 payroll gains were downwardly revised to negative 3,000.\nHowever, ADP\u2019s latest numbers come with some big caveats: A preliminary \u201crebenchmarking\u201d of the data was a significant factor behind the negative August revision and September\u2019s estimated job losses, ADP\u2019s chief economist Nela Richardson said Wednesday.\n\u201cWe found that once we benchmarked that data, it actually shows a September slowdown that has been consistent with what we\u2019ve been reporting all year,\u201d Richardson told reporters Wednesday, noting the process resulted in a reduction of 43,000 jobs in September, compared to pre-benchmarked data.\n\u201cIn fact, though the numbers changed, the story and the narrative and the trend remain the same: Hiring momentum has slowed from the beginning of the year through September,\u201d she added.\nSimilar to theBLS\u2019s two-step annual process, ADP recalibrates its estimates annually to the full-year 2024 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. The report provides a more comprehensive read on the number of businesses, employees and wages at the state, regional and county level because it derives that data from quarterly tax reports submitted by businesses to their states. However, the QCEW is heavily lagged.\nSeptember\u2019s estimated job gains, which ADP tabulated using anonymized and aggregated payroll data from its clients, came in well below economists\u2019 expectations for 50,000 jobs added.\nSmall private-sector businesses drove last month\u2019s decline, and losses were widespread across industries (with some of the largest losses in professional and business services and leisure and hospitality), ADP reported. The bulk of the hiring occurred at health care businesses, which have been the sole source of consistent employment growth this year.\nWhile ADP\u2019s estimates don\u2019t often correlate with the official monthly jobs numbers when they\u2019re released days later \u2014 and have been frequently criticized by economists for having a poor track record in making short-term predictions \u2014 the report is still considered an indicator of the labor market\u2019s trajectory.\nAnd that outlook has beenlooking increasingly bleak. In addition to the private-sector job losses, the latest (and last-for-now) release from the BLS showed that the US labor market activity has grown increasingly stagnant.\nThe BLS\u2019 jobs report for August showed that the economy added an estimated 22,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, its highest level in nearly four years. The report also showed that prior job gains were not just weaker than expected, they went negative in June.\nAll told, it reaffirmed that the US labor market is slowing and at risk of stalling out.\nExcluding the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, the hiring rate (hires as a percentage of total employment) fell in August to 3.2%, matching the lowest rate since 2013, according tothe BLS\u2019 Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey reportreleased Tuesday.\nJob gains were expected to pick up in September, however. Economists\u2019 forecasts called for a net gain of 50,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate would hold steady at 4.3%.\nUS stocks were broadly lower Wednesday in response to uncertainty around the government shutdown and remained at similar levels after the report was released.\nThe Federal Reserve may not have all of the labor market indicators it typically would have in its quiver; however, the lack of a monthly jobs report should not preclude the central bank from cutting interest rates further at the end of this month, economists say.\nThe condition of the US labor market supports another quarter-point cut, Joe Brusuelas, economist at RSM US, wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday.\n\u201cHiring is at risk as policy uncertainty driven by trade and immigration policy as well as long term demographic challenges that are adversely impacting the availability of labor supply,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGiven that the government shutdown and threats of mass firings permeate the latest edition of the fiscal follies, this is all not conducive to the October payroll outlook.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/01\/economy\/adp-private-jobs-report-september","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Rate cuts could exacerbate inflation.\nWall Street loves rate cuts, because they can help boost businesses\u2019 profits by lowering costs for loans. That gives more perceived underlying value to the companies\u2019 stocks, and it can give employers extra cash to hire. That\u2019s why rate cuts tend to boost the economy over time.\nStock investors have also cheered some long-awaited strength in the bond market, which has suddenly gained steam because of intensifying fears about a slowdown in job growth. The safe-haven US Treasury market has been on fire in recent days as traders have been pricing in Fed rate cuts, which tend to drive yields lower and prices higher (prices and yields trade in opposite directions). The 2-year Treasury yield is trading near its lowest level since the 2022 inflation crisis, and the 10-year Treasury yield is flirting with 4% for the first time since April\u2019s tariff-fueled meltdown.\nLower bond yields also help businesses spend less on their debt, adding potential value to their stocks.\nThe S&P 500, the benchmark for the stock market, has gained 6% since theshocking August 1 jobs reportshowed hiring slowed down significantly and the US economy had actually created a quarter million fewer jobs over the previous two months than previously believed. The market has been on a particular tear in September in the leadup to the Fed meeting, as more moribund jobs data poured in \u2013 the S&P 500 has posted gains in six of nine sessions this month.\nSo bad news about the economy has certainly been good news for stocks in recent months.\nBut that\u2019s not the full story.\nAlthough the Fed has undoubtedly boosted optimism that the already-historically expensive stock market still has room to run, strength in company earnings have helped give traders confidence, too: Wall Street\u2019s profit and sales growth expectations remain rock-solid.\nAnd, after all, the stock market is really just a collection of individual companies whose prices move up or down based on their perceived value. If investors didn\u2019t have faith that the companies that they trade would make them money, they probably wouldn\u2019t value the stocks so highly.\nThe artificial intelligence industry\u2019s electric growth has also been fueling the market\u2019s rise. Nine of the 10 most valuable stocks on the market are deeply involved in AI, and they collectively make up about 40% of the entire value of the stock market.\nTo give a sense of how much enthusiasm the market has for AI,Oracle\u2019s stock shot 36% higherin a single day last week, after a stellar forecast for AI-fueled datacenter demand. That briefly made cofounder Larry Ellison the world\u2019s richest person (though he finished Wednesday $1 billion poorer than Elon Musk), and it propelled Oracle (ORCL) into the top-10 list of most valuable companies on the market.\nAnd stocks have gained ground after Trump\u2019s tariffs went into effect in early August, giving businesses a bit of certainty after months of on-again, off-again trade threats that prevented companies from making informed decisions about their investments. The tax benefits delivered in Trump\u2019s signature \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d also helped give companies some additional support to their bottom lines \u2013 and it gives investors confidence that the massive fluctuations in White House policy maneuvers have settled down and they can therefore take on some more risk in their portfolios.\nMeanwhile, consumers have continued to spend, despite tariffs and growing concerns about the economy. Spending rose 0.5% in July, theCommerce Department reportedtwo weeks ago. That\u2019s crucial: Consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of US gross domestic product, the broadest measure of America\u2019s economy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the Fed,\u201d said Citi Research analyst Scott Chronert in a note to investors on Friday. \u201cEarnings expectations continue to be strong while rate volatility and levels falls. Combined, this is a powerful narrative for risk assets.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s still reason for concern.\nStocks are historically pricey: The S&P 500 is trading at 3.3 times the value of its constituents\u2019 sales expectations, thehighest on record. It\u2019s also at a historically high price-to-earnings ratio of 25 to 1; that means for a company to earn $1 in future earnings, investors are willing to pay $25 in share price. That means investors may be getting a bit ahead of themselves.\nPrice increases may start to weigh on consumer spending, eroding the case for companies\u2019 sales growth. Inflation this year has added $195 a month in costs for a typical American household, according to Moody\u2019s Chief Economist Mark Zandi.\nAs costs start to rise, consumers have been adding to their already massive debt loads, which could become a problem. Debt delinquencies are on the rise, accelerating because of student loan debt payments restarting in October 2024, according to Dana Telsey, CEO and chief research officer of Telsey Advisory Group. Student loan repayments will suck $80 billion out of the economy this year, Brookings said last week.\nInflation, though not at runaway levels like in 2022, is becoming such a concern that a traditional inflation hedge is setting new records: gold. Trading at nearly $3,700,gold has gained about 40% this yearand recently eclipsed its inflation-adjusted record-high set 45 years ago. Traders worried about inflation tend to pour money in gold, which some believe holds an intrinsic value that hedges against rising prices.\nGary Friedman, CEO of RH (formerly Restoration Hardware), made the case Thursday on a call with Wall Street analysts that tariffs and inflation pose a more significant threat to businesses than most people realize \u2013 so he\u2019s not all that excited about a rate cut from the Fed.\n\u201cWhat do I worry the most about? Just kill inflation. I\u2019m more motivated about killing inflation than getting an interest rate cut right now, because we had an interest rate cut and the tariffs create more inflation than anybody thinks,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to win because 50% of our competitors who are really good, hard working people, get wiped out.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think anybody is thinking about the math,\u201d he added.\nCNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/15\/business\/stock-market-dow-record-economy-jobs-inflation","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

It\u2019s the first negative employment month since December 2020, and it brings to an end what was the second-longest period of employment expansion on record.\n\u201cThe Great American jobs machine has stalled,\u201d Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote in commentary issued Friday.\nJuly\u2019s job gains were revised up slightly to 79,000 from 73,000, according to the report.\nEconomists were expecting that the economy added 76,500 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, according to FactSet.\nThe Dow rose 119 points, or 0.26%, Friday morning. The S&P 500 rose 0.41% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.63%, after the weaker-than-expected jobs data boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September to stimulate the economy.\nThrough August, monthly job gains average 74,750, BLS data shows. Excluding the pandemic, that\u2019s the slowest average monthly gain for that January to August time frame since 2010, when the United States was still licking its wounds from the Great Recession.\nAmerica\u2019s job market flashes yet another warning sign about the economy\n\u201cThe addition of just 22,000 jobs in August, along with net downward revisions of previous months, shows an economy straining under the immense economic uncertainty and significant policy changes of 2025,\u201d Laura Ullrich, Indeed\u2019s director of economic research for North America, wrote Friday.\nUncertainty has swelled since the beginning of the year in large part around how President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping policies on tariffs, immigration and federal spending would shake out through the economy.\nHiring efforts, already stymied in part by still-high interest rates, have been largely shelved due to the unknowns.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know where things are going, whether it\u2019s through tariffs or other dynamics \u2013 interest rates still aren\u2019t coming down \u2013 so I think a lot of companies are just saying, \u2018not now,\u2019\u201d Ron Hetrick, senior labor economist at employment analytics company Lightcast, told CNN in an interview. \u201cI think there\u2019s somebody probably out there who\u2019d like to hire, but not in this environment.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for more certainty to occur,\u201d he said.\nThe low-hire, low-fire environment is leaving workers and job hunters with few opportunities.\nAnd more workers are seeking those opportunities, as labor market re-entrants helped to lift the unemployment rate last month.\nThe labor force, which shrank for three months in a row, increased by 436,000 people in August, according to BLS data. The labor force participation rate moved higher as well, ticking up to 62.3% from 62.2%.\nWhile the majority of those labor force gains were from those classified as employed, the increase in those unemployed was largely attributed to those who re-entered the labor market and are searching for jobs.\n\u201cIn fact, the median time looking for work slipped to a three-month low, a bright spot in a generally weak jobs report,\u201d Jennifer Timmerman, senior investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, wrote in a note to investors Friday.\nOne of the longest streaks of uninterrupted job growth just ended\nA low-churn labor market puts the US labor market \u2014 and the broader economy \u2014 at greater risk, economists warn.\nThe limited job gains also are coming from practically a single source, exacerbating those concerns.\nThe US job market is being propped up primarily by ongoing employment gains in the health care industry. That sector, which has attributed for the lion\u2019s share of overall job growth this year, added 46,800 jobs in August.\nThat sector, however, accounts for just 15% of total employment, meaning many people are left on the sidelines.\n\u201cFor 85% of workers, they\u2019re not seeing a lot of the jobs added,\u201d Kory Kantenga, LinkedIn\u2019s head of economics Americas, told CNN this week.\nAnd wage gains are increasingly growing softer. The annual growth rate of average hourly earnings slowed to 3.7% in August, from 3.9% in July.\nWithout broader-based employment growth, the labor market is more vulnerable to shocks, he said.\n\u201cIf anything happens to that industry, you could easily see job growth fall off a cliff.\u201d\nWarning signs have been flashing for months that thejob market has been losing steam. That becamestarkly clearer in July, when weak job growth and larger-than-typical downward revisions spurred the unprecedented firing of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer by President Donald Trump who claimed, without evidence, that the disappointing data must have been \u201crigged.\u201d\nOther labor market data released so far this week further confirmed that the labor market has cooled down considerably: Private-sector hiring slowed sharply; initial jobless claims hit a nearly three-month high; layoff announcements picked up; and, for the first time in four years, thenumber of available jobs was lower than the number of job seekers.\nCNN\u2019s John Towfighi contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/05\/economy\/us-jobs-report-august-final","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

However, the guts of the report indicate that fissures may be spreading, some economists warn.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to play Debbie Downer by just reading the headlines and concluding nothing to worry about,\u201d Gregory Daco, EY-Parthenon\u2019s chief economist, told CNN. \u201cIn my opinion, we are starting to see an acceleration of labor market slowdown.\u201d\nEconomists were expecting the economy to have added 130,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate held at 4.2%, according to FactSet consensus estimates.\nFriday\u2019s report painted a picture of a \u201csteady but cautious\u201d labor market in the face of swelling economic uncertainty, said Ger Doyle, regional president for North America at employment firm ManpowerGroup.\nRelated articleDow jumps 550 points as Wall Street tries to cope with trade war, Trump-Musk spat\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping policy moves, especially a whipsaw approach to massive import tariffs, havedriven consumer sentiment lower, rattled markets and clouded businesses\u2019 lines of sight.\n\u201cThis is not a freeze, but a temporary chill,\u201d Doyle wrote in commentary Friday. \u201cEmployees are staying put, employers are holding steady, and everyone is waiting for clearer signs.\u201d\nWhile the pace of job growth remains fairly solid, this year\u2019s gains were even softer than initially thought,  Friday\u2019s report showed.\nMarch\u2019s and April\u2019s gains were revised down by a combined 95,000 jobs, resulting in employment increasing by an average monthly clip of nearly 124,000 jobs this year.\nThat may be above the 100,000 threshold (below which would be an indicator of potential weakness), but, excluding recession years, it\u2019s thelowest average monthly gainfor January through May in the past 30 years, an analysis of BLS data shows.\nIn the years following the economy-upheaving pandemic, job growth has slowed, but it has not collapsed. The gains haveremained solid enoughto fuel consumer spending and put the economy on track for a \u201csoft landing\u201d of reining in inflation without triggering a recession.\nMay\u2019s jobs report marks the 53rd consecutive month that the US economy has added jobs, the second-longest streak of employment expansion on record (behind the post-Great Recession\/pre-Covid market of late-2010 to early 2020), BLS data shows.\nHowever, economists have warned that the Trump administration\u2019sfrenetic trade policyand other actions \u2014 including drastic cutbacks to federal spending,layoffs of government workers, and reductions in immigration \u2014 not only threaten those soft landing odds but also heighten recession risks.\n\u201cThe May jobs report still has everyone waiting for the other shoe to drop,\u201d Daniel Zhao, Glassdoor\u2019s lead economist, wrote Friday. \u201cThis report shows the job market standing tall, but as economic headwinds stack up cumulatively, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the job market starts straining against those headwinds.\u201d\nNot knowing the size and breadth of tariffs (but knowing they very well might change), for example, has hindered businesses\u2019 abilities to operate and plan: They don\u2019t know what their costs will be in three months, let alone three days from now; and it\u2019s even more unclear whether consumers will keep spending.\nOutlooks have quickly become opaque.\nScores of the largest public US companieshave suspended their forecastsfor future earnings, temporarily blinding analysts and investors. And small businesses that have little room for error have beenleft frozen in their tracks.\nAlthough layoffs remain low,hiring has slowedandworkers are staying put, slowing the all-important \u201cchurn\u201d behind a healthy labor market.\n\u201cThe labor market is revealing fragility,\u201d Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, told CNN in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no margin for error when you\u2019ve got a low pace of hiring, a low pace of quits.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s jobs report showed that opportunities dwindled for many workers. Almost the entirety of the month\u2019s employment gains (nearly 91%) was concentrated in just two sectors: health care and social assistance, and leisure and hospitality.\nHalf of all major industries added jobs in May (or lost jobs, if one\u2019s a glass-half-empty type of person), according to the BLS\u2019 employment \u201cdiffusion index.\u201d Across manufacturing, only 41.7% of industries added jobs.\n\u201cWhen manufacturing is losing jobs and the diffusion index suggests those losses are broad, it\u2019s more indicative of an industry-wide phenomenon, and could warrant concern for the broader economy,\u201d Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet\u2019s senior economist, wrote in a note Friday.\nOverall last month, themanufacturing sectorlost 8,000 jobs.\nThe largest job losses in May, however, occurred in the federal government, which saw its employment bloodletting worsen due to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to slash the federal workforce and gut agencies and spending.\nRelated articleDOGE layoffs may have compromised the accuracy of government data\nThe federal government has posted job losses for four consecutive months, dropping 13,000 jobs in February, 11,000 in March, 13,000 in April, and another 22,000 in May.\nThere\u2019s more to come on that front. The bulk of the losses to date likely reflect early retirements versus Department of Government Efficiency-driven layoffs, Swonk said. The losses from the latter could be spread out over many months to come: Not all federal workers were laid off immediately and other actions are being challenged in court.\nThe federal workforce represents a tiny share of overall employment; however, Trump\u2019s federal cuts appear to causing collateral damage in the private sector, Swonk said, noting job losses at scientific labs.\nBLS data shows that scientific, research and development services lost 3,900 jobs in May, which followed a 4,400-job loss in April. On a year-to-date basis, that industry is running in the red for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe BLS\u2019 monthly snapshot of the labor market is composed of two surveys: One of businesses (which measures employment, hours and earnings), and one of households (which provides demographic data and feeds into the all-important unemployment rate).\nWhile the household survey tends to have more volatility, May\u2019s readings from that particular wing of the report rang more alarm bells than usual.\nThe unemployment rate didn\u2019t budge, but more workers left the labor market. The labor participation rate fell by 0.2 percentage points to 62.4%. And while the labor force losses were broad-based, they were more heavily concentrated in women over the age of 55 and men of prime working age (25 to 54), Swonk said.\nThe household survey also indicated that more people who were not working were instead in school or training.\nRelated articleTrump met with Jerome Powell today to scold him about rates. Powell stressed the Fed is staying out of politics\n\u201cThat tends to be something that happens when the labor market weakens,\u201d she said.\nBut for now, the labor market is \u201cgood enough\u201d and \u201cstrong enough\u201d to keep the Federal Reserve in its holding pattern as higher tariffs have reignited concerns about inflation, Wells Fargo economists wrote in a note to clients Friday.\nKey inflation data is due out next week with the release of the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\u201cThat said, with both the soft and hard data on the labor market showing employment conditions softening, we still expect [Fed policymakers] to be cutting later this year,\u201d they wrote.\nTrump, however, reiterated Friday that he\u2019d like to see interest rates go down sooner than later.

{"title":"US private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, missing expectations for an increase of 115,000","date":"2025-07-02","body":"The US private sector lost jobs in June, the first negative month in more than two years, according to new data Wednesday from payroll provider ADP.\nUS employers lost an estimated 33,000 jobs, according to ADP\u2019s monthly national employment report.\nEconomists were expecting ADP\u2019s report to show a net gain of 115,000 jobs, according to FactSet.\nThe losses were driven largely by stalled hiring plans, Nela Richardson, chief economist for ADP said.\n\u201cThough layoffs continue to be rare, a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cStill, the slowdown in hiring has yet to disrupt pay growth.\u201d\nADP\u2019s tabulations don\u2019t always correlate with the official federal jobs report \u2014 for example, ADP\u2019s March 2023 reading was eventually revised down to a net loss of 53,000 jobs, while the official jobs data shows a net gain of 48,000 private-sector jobs of the overall 85,000 jobs added (largely due to a 30,000-job lift then from state and local governments).\nHowever, the trajectory of what ADP reports is sometimes looked to as a proxy for overall hiring and wage growth activity. At the time, March 2023 marked the slowest monthly gain since a decline in December 2020.\nWhen the latest employment snapshot from the Department of Labor is released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET (one day early due to the July 4th holiday), economists expect it to show that 115,000 jobs were added in June. That\u2019s a pullback from the 139,000 initially estimated for May, according to FactSet.\nThey also expect the unemployment rate to increase by 0.1 percentage point, to 4.3%, which would be the highest jobless rate since October 2021.\nWednesday\u2019s ADP tally is the first negative reading since March 2023 and, when considering unrevised first reports, it\u2019s the first negative reading anytime in the past few years, noted Abiel Reinhart, economist at JPMorgan.\nDuring the past year, the average absolute error between ADP and the BLS number has been about 75,000 the past year, Reinhart said, noting that one reason for the discrepancy is that the BLS number is higher on first estimate and revised downward.\n\u201cBut the bigger story here beyond the month-to-month forecasting performance of ADP is that the series is clearly weakening, and this has been occurring quite steadily since the start of the year,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday.\nSome economists said Wednesday they weren\u2019t changing their estimates for Thursday in the wake of the ADP news.\nPantheon Macroeconomics economists said they were anticipating private payrolls to see a net gain of 100,000 jobs, which would probably still be strong enough for the Federal Reserve to stay on pause later this month. Pantheon economists said the ADP number \u201cdefies credulity,\u201d noting a loss of 52,000 jobs in health care and education, a sector that\u2019s been adding 77,000 on average the past six months.\nStill, there\u2019s a potential for education and health care to have weaker growth in June. That sector\u2019s job gains tend to be softer in the summer, and the slowdown may be worse this year \u201cdue to the low hiring-low firing labor market\u201d and federal spending cuts, Bank of America economists noted this week.\nADP\u2019s negative number did appear to move the rate cut needle a little bit for investors. The markets expectations for a July rate cut increased to 25% from just under 21% the day before, according toCME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool.\nLabor market data can often be a slow burn.\nTypically, it takes a little time for economic shifts to be reflected in the numbers (with exceptions being major shocks, say, like a global pandemic).\nThe first six months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term in office have been marked by sweeping policy actions \u2014 including broad-based tariffs, deportations, federal spending cuts and government workforce layoffs \u2014 that have the potential to reshape the American economy and global order.\nHowever, while it may take time for these policies to work their way through the economy and become clearer in economic data, the indirect impacts already are making their mark:\nJob growth is becoming anemic, Ron Hetrick, senior labor economist at Lightcast, told CNN in an interview.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t supposed to be that way. Economists, markets and businesses alike were pretty sure they\u2019d have one, if not two, rate cuts from the Federal Reserve by now that would have helped juice the economy (somethingFed Chair Jerome Powell said himself Tuesday).\n\u201cWe were starting to see some excitement toward the end of last year,\u201d Hetrick said, referencing hiring plans conveyed to him by IT staffing companies. \u201cWhen the uncertainty entered in, when the tariff uncertainty entered in, the Fed got nervous about changing rates, and you just saw all of that retracted overnight. All of these discussions, all of these [hiring] plans, everybody just said, \u2018Well, not right now.\u2019\u201d\nRelated articlePowell says the Fed would have cut rates this year if it weren\u2019t for tariffs\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between true economic weakness \u2014 which is no one\u2019s buying my stuff, and I\u2019m going to go out of business \u2014 and a lack of hiring because of uncertainty,\u201d Hetrick said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we have a weak labor market because the economy is poor. I think we have a weak labor market because companies don\u2019t feel good.\u201d\nBut that weakness ultimately could feed on itself and make the labor market \u2014 and economy \u2014 more vulnerable to shocks, cautioned Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet.\n\u201cIt will be months or even years before we see the full effects of tariffs, federal cuts and immigration policies in the labor market,\u201d she told CNN in an email. \u201cBut if we continue to see increasing weakness, these things may have a more resounding impact, as the labor market won\u2019t be robust enough to weather a storm.\u201d\nThe headline numbers from the May jobs report indicated that the labor market was cooling, but not collapsing. Employers added an estimated 139,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%.\nHowever, the guts of the report indicated that cracks were continuing to spread. Nearly 91% of the month\u2019s job gains came from health care and leisure and hospitality.\nThe labor participation rate fell, and the main reason the unemployment rate didn\u2019t budge was because more workers left the labor force.\nThe unemployment rate is a critical indicator of economic health; however, in part due to seismic shifts around immigration, it\u2019s losing its luster and instead turning into a math problem.\nRelated articleThousands of young Americans at risk of homelessness if Job Corps ends\n\u201cUnemployment is still low, but we\u2019ve got to watch how we get to that unemployment number,\u201d Hetrick said. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing it because your labor force is shrinking, you\u2019re not doing it through strength. You\u2019re doing it through a math equation.\u201d\nForeign-born workers, irrespective of legal status, have accounted for about three-quarters of total labor force growth since February 2020, according to an analysis released in June from Wells Fargo economists. And recent efforts to curtail unauthorized immigration are contributing to a shrinking of the labor force, they noted.\n\u201cWhereas immigration overstated the pace of labor market cooling last year, it could now paint an overly rosy picture of its health,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe expect the unemployment rate to peak at just 4.5% in the year ahead as weaker demand for workers coincides with weaker supply. Although this would mark a less abrupt increase than the rise in the unemployment rate that helped spur the Fed to ease monetary policy last year, the uptick amid a slowing supply backdrop (and from a higher starting point) would make the increase more precarious.\u201d\nThe labor market is in a state of low churn: Hiring activity is running near 10-year lows and workers aren\u2019t feeling confident enough to quit; however, employers, for the most part, are holding on to the workers they have.\nLayoff activity hasn\u2019t accelerated recently, according to weekly jobless claims data, layoff announcement reports, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act postings, and the government\u2019s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey report.\nOn Wednesday, Challenger, Gray & Christmas released its latest report that tracks layoff announcements. In June, US-based employers announced 47,999 job cuts, marking a 49% decline from May and a 2% drop from June of last year.\nLayoff announcements tend to decrease in June \u2014 a month when some companies\u2019 fiscal year ends \u2014 and July, Challenger historical data shows.\nYear to date, layoff announcements are running at the hottest rate since the pandemic and, before that, the Great Recession, Challenger noted.\nRelated articleTrump\u2019s trade deals are stalling out at the worst possible time\nHowever, 288,628, or nearly 40%, of the 744,308 announced cuts made in the first half of 2025 came from mass layoffs conducted by the Department of Government Efficiency initiative launched by the Trump administration with Elon Musk at the helm.\nPlans can change, and announcements (or reported cuts) might not result in job losses. For example, not all federal workers were laid off immediately, some have been rehired, and other actions are being challenged in court.\nThe BLS data shows that the federal government has shed jobs since February. Through May, the sector has lost a combined 56,000 jobs.\nStill, the federal government accounts for a tiny share (1.8%) of overall employment, and the federal workforce has remained largely stable for much of the past 80 years: Most of the public sector job gains (schools, utilities, etc.) have occurred at the state and local level.\nTuesday\u2019s JOLTS data showed that layoffs fell in May from 1.79 million to 1.6 million, staying below pre-pandemic levels. The rate of layoffs remains near record lows.\nThe most recent jobless claims data will be released Thursday morning at the same time as the jobs report. First-time claims have slowly moved higher; however, continuing claims are running near four-year highs, indicating that people are having a harder time finding work.\n\u201cThe early impacts of tariffs are just one drag on the job market,\u201d Daniel Zhao, economist for Glassdoor, wrote last month. \u201cA bevy of other headwinds are accumulating including federal layoffs and funding cuts, slowing immigration and revocation of TPS work authorization, high interest rates, and more.

For every $1 million of recycled fabrics, organic clothing and other products that landed in the US from countries such as India and China, Passenger was responsible for an additional $500,000 of duties, the company said in a mid-April statement announcing the pause of its US operations.\nWilliams officially lost his job on April 11.\nEconomists have warned that early layoffs like Williams\u2019could be the first signs of labor market fallout from Trump\u2019s steep (and shifting) tariffs, which have ramped up uncertainty testing thenimbleness of businesses of all sizes.\nRelated articleHow Trump\u2019s tariffs and other policies are \u2018raising hell,\u2019 according to business owners\nFriday\u2019s jobs report will provide some hints as to how much US employers are able to bend before they break.\n\u201cThe labor market is good, but it\u2019s not exceptional, and we\u2019re in the process of putting some real strain on the economy,\u201d Claudia Sahm, New Century Advisors chief economist, told CNN in an interview.\nEconomists expect that the May jobs report, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET Friday morning, could show the labor market is softening. The consensus forecast is for the economy to have added 130,000 jobs, slowing froma stronger-than-expected 177,000 gain in April, and for the unemployment rate to hold at 4.2% for the third consecutive month, according to FactSet estimates.\nThe Labor Department\u2019s weekly jobless claims report has shown higher numbers of first-time claims last month as well as people who have remained on unemployment for multiple weeks.\nLast week, first-time claims rose more than expected and totaled an estimated 247,000 filings, marking the highest weekly tally since October 2024, according to Department of Labor data released Thursday.\nContinuing claims, which are filed by people who have received unemployment insurance for at least a week or more, continue to bump up against a three-and-a-half-year high.\n\u201cThis is a market where there are stops and starts, and there are pullbacks in hiring,\u201d Nela Richardson, chief economist at payroll giant ADP, said Wednesday. \u201cWith establishments, especially small establishments, when there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean that the demand isn\u2019t there but the timing may be off \u2014 firms would rather wait and see than hire aggressively.\u201d\nThe hiring rate, the number of hires as a percentage of total employment, ticked higher in April to 3.5%, but remains below pre-pandemic levels, according toBureau of Labor Statistics data released earlier this week.\nAnd by ADP\u2019s count (which doesn\u2019t always correlate with the official jobs report) hiring dropped off precipitously in April and May, when the private sector gained60,000 and 37,000 jobs, respectively.\n\u201cThe weak numbers we\u2019re seeing now does not point to a labor market that\u2019s collapsing, but there is hiring hesitancy,\u201d Richardson said Wednesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like driving through fog for some of our firms here,\u201d she added.\nThough the ripple effects from various Trump policiescould take longer to show up in the data, the federal workforce reductions have already started appearing. The federal government posted job losses for three consecutive months, dropping 13,000 jobs in February, 4,000 in March and 9,000 in April, BLS data shows.\nMore losses could be spread over many months to come: Not all federal workers were laid off immediately, and other actions are being challenged in court.\nThrough May, announced job cuts are running significantly higher than in recent years; however, the lion\u2019s share of the cutbacks have come from the federal government.\nRelated articleWashington, DC sees spike in homes for sale amid DOGE federal worker layoffs\nDepartment of Government Efficiency-related cost-cutting and its downstream effects have led to more than 294,000 announced job cuts, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas data released Thursday.

Dow futures fell 40 points. S&P 500 futures slid 0.1%, and futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 slid 0.2%. All three major indexes moved into the green shortly after the opening bell.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping policy moves, especially a whipsaw approach to massive import tariffs, haveleft businesses shellshocked, uncertain of input costs and the extent to which these changing policies could rattle consumers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like driving through fog for some of our firms here,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that situation, you can\u2019t really stop, but you might slow down \u2026 when it comes to hiring, there\u2019s a hesitancy because of a wide level of uncertainty.\u201d\nAnd it was the smallest of firms that lost the biggest share of jobs, Richardson noted. Firms with under 50 employees shed 13,000 jobs in May.\n\u201cAs goes small business, so goes the economy,\u201d she said. \u201cThis weakness is something that we\u2019re paying close attention to.\u201d\nSeparate datareleased Wednesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that some small businesses in New York and New Jersey that were exposed to higher tariffs have taken big hits to their bottom lines. As a result, these firms made modest reductions to their employment levels, and are passing most \u2014 and in some cases all \u2014 of the tariff-related cost increases to their customers, according to the New York Fed.\nDespite the stark pullback in hiring, pay growth held up, presenting an encouraging sign of stability within the labor market, she said.\nPay growth for those who stayed at their employer and those who switched jobs was 4.5% and 7%, respectively.\nFollowing the ADP release, Trump took to social media Wednesday morning to ramp up pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates.\n\u201cADP NUMBER OUT!!! \u201cToo Late\u201d Powell must now LOWER THE RATE.

Trump\u2019s policies could chill it further","date":"2025-05-01","body":"It all comes down to the job market.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s drastic policy moves, and thetwists and turnsthat have come alongside them, have made economic forecasting a squirrely endeavor.\nThe sheer uncertainty of what\u2019s to come has put markets on the fritz and sent soft data (like consumer sentiment surveys) sounding alarms. Now, the hard data (tried-and-true economic metrics that are lagged for good reason) isstarting to reflectsome of the disarray.\nAtumultuous tariff program and trade warhave sentrecession oddshigher.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not fool ourselves, things are going to get worse later this year, probably later in the summer,\u201d Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, told CNN in an interview. \u201cBut for now, we really need to cross our fingers and hope that incomes and jobs hold up, because those are the things that will insulate us.\u201d\nThe engine of the US economy is the American consumer,whose spendingaccounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity. And the lifeblood of consumer spending comes from one critical source: the US labor market.\nAnd as it stands now, and as it likely stood in April, that fuel source hasn\u2019t run dry \u2014 but it very well could be starting to crack under the pressure.\n\u201cThe economy appears strong in the data \u2026 job growth is continuing, the unemployment rate is at a fine level; there are no warning signs there, but I think what the data doesn\u2019t show is that the risks have increased,\u201d Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, told CNN in an interview this week. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot going on, and there are a lot more and greater risks to the labor market and to the broader economy now than there were, say, three months ago.\u201d\nOn Friday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the jobs report for April, and it\u2019s expected that the US economy added 135,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate stood pat at 4.2%, according to FactSet consensus economists estimates.\nIf April\u2019s estimates hold true, they\u2019d mark a significant retreat from March, where preliminary estimates showed astronger-than-anticipated net gain of 228,000 jobs. Economists expect that prior 228,000 estimate to be revised down come Friday now that more complete information is available (after all, March\u2019s report included a downward revision of 48,000 jobs to January and February combined).\nThrough March, employment growth has averaged 152,000 jobs per month. That\u2019s the slowest first-quarter growth since 2020 (when a massive 14 million jobs were lost that March) and, before the pandemic, since 2011, BLS data shows.\n\u201cThe headwinds that we were looking at before the March report are still there and almost certainly stronger now,\u201d Dean Baker, senior economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic Policy Research, wrote in a note issued earlier this week.\nTariffs were partly in place in March: It was the second month that initial tariffs on Chinese goods were in effect (20%); plus, the global25% tariffs on steel and aluminumimports took effect March 12. Additionally, the Trump administration placed a hiring freeze on the federal workforce,slashed jobs across agenciesand canceled massive amounts of grants and contracts.\n\u201cThis has not led to any substantial uptick in unemployment claims, but surveys of both businesses and consumers have turned sharply negative in the last two months,\u201d Baker noted. \u201cIt is hard to believe that this has not had some impact on hiring.\u201d\nNow businesses have to contend with plenty more unknowns.\nIn April, the tariff headwinds grew stronger as Trump ramped up duties onChinese imports to 145%; placed a 10% baseline tariff on all imported goods; applied a 25% tariff on cars; and imposed \u2014 then delayed \u2014 additional, and varying \u201creciprocal\u201d duties on dozens of countries.\nRelated articleThe last boats without crippling tariffs from China are arriving. The countdown to shortages and higher prices has begun\nBeyond tariffs, the federal spending cuts have continued, as have deportations and other anti-immigration actions.\nThe latest labor turnover data released earlier this week showed that some employers are retrenching. In March, job openings sank to their lowest level since September, a time when pre-election uncertainty helped to dampen hiring plans.\nSome economists expect those \u201cholding patterns\u201d to become even more evident in the jobs data when it\u2019s released Friday. Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon, estimates that April\u2019s job growth could be a paltry 65,000.\n\u201cSince the March jobs report, timely indicators such as initial jobless claims have not suggested a material surge in layoffs, but job cut announcements released by Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicate that layoffs are creeping higher as employers grow increasingly cautious about the outlook,\u201d she wrote in a note to clients. \u201cBusiness surveys also point to deteriorating labor market trends.\u201d\nThe downside risks only grew in April, she added.\n\u201cThe payroll survey for the jobs report was conducted the week after the April 2 reciprocal tariff announcement, when uncertainty and volatility were extremely high, which could have weighted on hiring decisions,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMoreover, April is a month when seasonal factors are substantially negative, especially in services industries.\u201d\nThe seasonal adjustment calculations meant to counterbalance the spikes in springtime hiring could very well serve as a drag on Friday\u2019s numbers if seasonal hiring this April was depressed due to uncertainty around tariffs, she added.\nThough the ripple effects from tariffs and immigration-related activities could take longer to show up in the data, the federal workforce reductions already have started appearing. The sector posted job losses for two consecutive months, dropping 11,000 jobs in February and 4,000 jobs in March, BLS data shows.\nMore losses are expected, but could be spread over many months to come: While nearly 300,000 job cuts have been announced, not all federal workers were laid off immediately, so the impact to the labor market and unemployment is going to be a slow drip.\nJob cuts by the government represented the largest chunk of layoffs so far this year, up 680% from the same period last year. Department of Government Efficiency-related cost-cutting led to a total of 281,452 layoffs, according to new data released Thursday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\nFor the month of April, US-based employers announced plans to cut 105,441 jobs, according to the Challenger report. That\u2019s significantly higher than the 64,789 job cuts announced last April. However, a large chunk (40,000 jobs) of last month\u2019s layoff count can be attributed to plans tied to two major employers: UPS and Intel.\nRelated articleAmerica\u2019s economy may actually be even weaker than it appears\nEarlier this week,UPS said it plans to cut 20,000 jobsthis year as part of a previously announced plan to increase automation and trim its Amazon business. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Intel was expected to cut 20,000 workers; however, the company has not announced specific details for potential upcoming layoffs.\nCutting through the noise, there is a clear trend of economic uncertainty weighing on businesses, noted Andrew Challenger, senior vice president for the outplacement and business coaching firm.\n\u201cThough the government cuts are front and center, we saw job cuts across sectors last month,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cGenerally, companies are citing the economy and new technology. Employers are slow to hire and limiting hiring plans as they wait and see what will happen with trade, supply chain, and consumer spending.\u201d\nWeekly jobless claims, which are considered a proxy for layoffs, remain near pre-pandemic levels and below historic averages \u2014despite surging uncertainty and rising numbers of layoff announcements. The initial claims data, although highly volatile and subject to revision, has risen in importance as a potential indicator for how Trump\u2019s sweeping actions \u2014 including mass layoffs of federal government workers \u2014 are filtering through the economy.\nLast week, the number of first-time claims jumped to their highest level since late-February. There were 241,000 initial claims for unemployment insurance filed during the week ended April 26, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. That total is up 18,000 from the week before.\nThursday\u2019s report also showed that people continue to stay unemployed for longer: The number of continuing claims, which are filed by Americans who have received at least a week or more of jobless benefits, climbed by 83,000 to 1.916 million, the highest level since November 2021.\nHealth care, state and local government, leisure and hospitality:These three sectors have been the leading drivers of overall job growth in recent years. Health care should continue to lead in job gains; however, the pace is expected to slow.\nA downswing in state and local government hiring could be an indication of the negative ripple effects from federal spending reductions; at the same time, states and municipalities have sought out laid-off federal workers for empty roles.\n\u201cState and local government is the place where you often have safety net measures in place; so if we do go into a recession, seeing how well they\u2019re holding up in terms of employment is also useful,\u201d said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.\nIn addition to the seasonal adjustment effects economist Boussour noted, slow job gains or losses in leisure and hospitality could also reflect a pullback in discretionary spending among rattled consumers.\nHours worked:If the average workweek dips lower, that could be a warning signal of what could come, Gould told CNN.\n\u201cAre people getting fewer hours? Are the shifts being reduced?\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not letting go workers, necessarily, but maybe they\u2019re lowering [employees] hours of work.\u201d\nWage growth:The annual rate of average hourly earnings dipped to 3.8% in March from 4% in February. With more workers uncertain about their future job prospects and the overall economy, they\u2019re staying put \u2014 and less job-hopping means wage gains could continue to soften at a time when tariffs could cause prices to rise.\nWage gains have normalized after a post-pandemic spike; and while the stability is in line with what the Federal Reserve hopes to see (as inflation cools), the policy climate is far different \u2014 and far more unstable \u2014 than anticipated. New data released this week showed that US workers\u2019 pay and benefits grew at their slowest pace in nearly four years during the first-quarter period when policy-related uncertainty started to weigh on hiring plans, according to new data released Wednesday.\nUnemployment for Black workers:\u201cThe Trump administration has made clear that it intends to reverse all efforts at encouraging the hiring of Black workers and other minorities \u2014 not just in the federal government but in the private sector as well,\u201d CEPR\u2019s Baker noted. \u201cThis will almost certainly dim their employment prospects.\u201d\nIn March, the employment to population ratio for Black workers dropped to 58.4%, the lowest since August 2022. Monthly data is highly volatile, especially for specific metrics such as this.\nConstruction and manufacturing:Construction has been a steady source of job growth; however, a dampening of demand coupled with rising input costs could cause that growth to falter.\nThe same could be true for manufacturers, who could feel the pinch from costlier goods imported from abroad, said Noah Yosif, chief economist at the American Staffing Agency.\nThis article has been updated with additional reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/01\/business\/us-jobs-report-preview-april","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Fed policymakers also fretted over whether the labor market\u2019s resilience could persist, especially if Trump continues with his haphazard on-again, off-again tariff regime.\n\u201cParticipants assessed that there was a risk that the labor market would weaken in coming months, that considerable uncertainty surrounded the outlook for the labor market, and that outcomes would depend importantly on the evolution of trade policy as well as other government policies,\u201d the minutes said.\nEarlier this month, Fed officials voted tohold borrowing costs steadyfor the third consecutive meeting, waiting for clarity on the direction of Trump\u2019s policies and how the US economy will respond to his massive policy shifts.\nNew polls show that Americans do not believe President Trump has a good plan when it comes to tariffs. Harry Enten shows us why the uncertainty index is going through the roof.\nRelated videoDoes Donald Trump have a clear plan for tariffs and trade?\nThe labor market\u2019s resilience has also allowed Fed officials to stay on hold, since it means they don\u2019t have to step in to provide the economy with some relief through a rate cut. But that could change if it turns out hiring is slowing sharply, or even declining.\nSome Fed officials noted that \u201ctheir contacts and business survey respondents reported limiting or pausing hiring because of elevated uncertainty.\u201d\nBut so far, things don\u2019t look too shabby for the US labor market. Last month, unemployment stood ata low 4.2% as employers added a robust 177,000 jobs. New applications for unemployment benefits also remain relatively low.\nThe US economy\u2019s future now largely hinges on what happens with Trump\u2019s ever-evolving trade war, but it seems like tensions have mostly eased since early April, when Trump unveiled a massive tariff hike on dozens of countries.\nTrump delayed his so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs until July 9, after they briefly went into effect. Since then, some countries have signaled they\u2019re willing to negotiate and potentially strike a full trade deal with the United States. On May 8, the United Kingdom was the first trading partner toannounce an agreement with the US, which wasn\u2019t a fleshed-out trade deal, but rather a concept of a framework.\nThen, on May 12, China and the US jointly announced that both countries will drastically roll back tariffs on each other\u2019s goods for an initial 90-day period. And the European Union this week said it is willing to fast-track trade negotiations with the US, which prompted Trump to back down from his recent threat to impose a 50% tariff on imports from the EU.\nBut the clock is ticking on more than 100 trade deals that Trump has to get done by early July. AndChina still has a bone to pick over a few issues. Last week, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said the US is \u201cundermining\u201d the framework both countries laid out in Geneva earlier this month, after the Trump administration warned companies against using AI chips made by Chinese tech titan Huawei. Beijing has also said it doesn\u2019t have any role to play in stemming the flow of fentanyl into the US, defying Trump\u2019s demand that it does something to stop the scourge of the drug.\nThe health of the labor market is crucial because it is precisely how Americans are able to fuel the economy with their dollars. Consumer spending makes up about 70% of the US economy.\nIf layoffs start to rise, Americans would be forced to rein in their spending, triggering a downward spiral that would lead to weaker economic growth and even more layoffs.\nThe air is still rife with uncertainty for the Fed, businesses and consumers. The University of Michigan said in a preliminary survey that consumer sentiment this month dropped to its second-lowest reading on records going back to 1952, while the Conference Board said Americans felt more upbeat in May for the first time in months.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/28\/economy\/fed-minutes-may-meeting","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

Trump disagrees \u2014 and blames Biden","date":"2025-02-07","body":"By many measures, America\u2019s job market looks to be in good shape: In January, unemployment was at a historically low 4% as employers continued the second-longest streak of job growth in US history, according tofresh government data out Friday.\nThe Trump administration, however, had a more pessimistic view, pointing to an annual benchmark revision released Friday showing there were 589,000 fewer jobs added to the economy in 2024 than previously tallied.\n\u201cThe benchmark told us that the downward revisions for the Biden job record were about cumulatively a whole million people, so we had a million fewer workers in the US than the (Bureau of Labor Statistics) told us right before the election than we actually had,\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan Friday.\n\u201cThe jobs market is way worse than we thought,\u201d he said.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed that sentimentin a statement: \u201cToday\u2019s jobs report reveals the Biden economy was far worse than anyone thought, and underscores the necessity of President Trump\u2019s pro-growth policies.\u201d\nRelated articleTrump routinely calls economic data \u2018fake.\u2019 Here\u2019s why that\u2019s dangerous\nBut the annual revision is a routine review of the surveys that generate monthly employment data, which are then reconciled with estimates from other statistical sources that weren\u2019t available when the numbers were first reported.\nThe latest annual revision was indeed larger than usual, but not unusually so. In fact, there was a downward revision of514,000 jobs (-0.3%) for the year ended in March 2019during Trump\u2019s first term before the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAnd while federal government surveys have become less robust because ofplummeting response ratesin recent years, the numbers still present a vital snapshot of the world\u2019s biggest economy.\nThe US job market these days isn\u2019t running at the same red-hot pace coming out of the pandemic, but it remains solid.\nStill, hiring has slowed recently, as job seekers,especially young people, can attest.\nThe rate at which Americans are hired continued to hover at 2013 levels in December, according to the latest data released this week, as Americans quit less frequently than they have in recent years.\nIn November, the number of Americans unemployed for more than 26 weeks reached its highest level in more than two years, though it declined in December and January.\nLydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon, said in commentary issued Friday that the United States has a \u201cfrozen, but robust labor market\u201d that\u2019s expected to see \u201cjob growth to slow below trend this year and see the unemployment rate rising towards 4.4%.\u201d\nIt could get worse if Trump proceeds with slapping 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, which hedelayed until March 1from the original February 1 date.\n\u201cSteep tariffs and heightened policy uncertainty could push businesses to increasingly adopt wait-and-see behaviors and pull back on hiring,\u201d Boussour said. \u201cThis could lead to a more severe job slowdown, weaker income and restrained consumer spending amidst much higher inflation.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/02\/07\/business\/job-market-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The US job market may be running low on gas","date":"2025-07-31","body":"The US job market seems to have chugged along for the first half of this year \u2014 butthe risk is risingthat employment growth is running out of steam.\nThe July jobs report, due for release at 8:30 a.m. ET Friday, is expected to show a net gain of 115,000 jobs, which would mark a considerable downshift fromJune\u2019s 147,000 jobs. The unemployment rate is expected to tick up to 4.2% from 4.1%, according to FactSet consensus estimates.\nThrough June, the US has added between 102,000 and 158,000 jobs per month, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. Those are solid gains and widely thought to be in line with the breakeven point, where the jobs added keep up with labor force growth and hold the unemployment rate steady.\nHowever, outside of the pandemic recession in 2020, that current 130,000-jobs-per-month pace is the weakest January-to-June average since 2010, when the US economy was licking its wounds from the Great Recession.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting more and more reliant on a very small part of the economy to drive any sort of job growth,\u201d Heather Long, chief economist for Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThere just are no jobs right now, AI or no AI, tariffs or no tariffs.\u201d\nHiring has become anemic (with the exception of a select few industries). Businesses have held back on adding new workers in large part because they\u2019ve beengripped by uncertaintyabout where tariffs might ultimately settle in President Donald Trump\u2019svolatile trade war.\n\u201cWhen companies can\u2019t make predictions about the economy and therefore their operations, they tend to wait for more information,\u201d Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, wrote earlier this week. \u201cIn the current environment, that predictive information is changing from week to week, so we\u2019ve ended up in a perpetual holding pattern when it comes to expanding or cutting back on workers.\u201d\nCouple that with reticent workers discouraged about their job-hopping prospects, and it results in a labor market with little turnover, instead of the solid churn that\u2019s needed for a healthy economy.\nThe latest federal data on labor turnover, which was released earlier this week, further confirmed that trend: The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed fewer job openings in June, hiring at a one-year low and a quits rate below the five-year average.\nOther closely watched indicators show that layoff activity hasn\u2019t accelerated recently, despite job cut announcements trending higher this year (in large part due to the Trump administration\u2019s gutting of federal agencies).\nInitial jobless claims remain at low levels; however, continuing unemployment claims have consistently butted against a November 2021 high.\nNew Labor Department data Thursday showed that first-time claims for unemployment insurance made last week (considered a proxy for layoffs) ticked up to 218,000 from 217,000 the week before. The number of continuing claims held at 1.946 million, staying close that nearly four-year high.\nIn terms of what could be coming down the pike, Challenger, Gray & Christmas\u2019 latest job cut announcement tracker showed 62,075 layoffs announced in July, up 29% from June.\n\u201cWe are seeing the federal budget cuts implemented by [the Department of Government Efficiency] impact nonprofits and health care in addition to the government,\u201d said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of the outplacement and coaching business. \u201cAI was cited for over 10,000 cuts last month, and tariff concerns have impacted nearly 6,000 jobs this year.\u201d\nThe unemployment rate went down in June but so did the size of the labor force, and participation rates fell off as well.\nThe unemployment rate is a critical indicator of economic health; however, in part due to seismic shifts around immigration, it\u2019s losing its luster and instead turning into a math problem.\nForeign-born workers, irrespective of legal status, have accounted for about three-quarters of total labor force growth since February 2020, according to an analysis released in June from Wells Fargo economists. And recent efforts to curtail unauthorized immigration are contributing to a shrinking of the labor force, they noted.\nJob growth tends to slow in the summer months and at the turn of some firms\u2019 fiscal years, but the US labor market is also in the thick of a structural slog, with job gains overwhelmingly concentrated in a fraction of industries.\n\u201cThe job market is frozen outside of health care and education, and this is a real hardship for anyone looking for a job,\u201d said Navy Federal Credit Union\u2019s Long.\nThe average duration of unemployment rose to 23 weeks in June, and the share of unemployed workers who have been out of a job for 27 weeks or more rose to 23.3%, edging near a three-year high, according to BLS data.\nIn June, health care, social assistance and state and local government businesses \u2014 which account for under 15% of overall employment \u2014 were responsible for 94% of the month\u2019s job gains, BLS data shows.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there likely were some anomalies in the estimated gains for state and local government entities in June (they were clocked at +80,000). Education jobs typically fall in the summer months, but the drop-off this year might not have been as sharp as years past, so the BLS\u2019 seasonal adjustment factors registered that as a strong gain instead, economists noted last month.\nThe expectation is that health care, social assistance and leisure and hospitality will drive the job gains in July.\nJune\u2019s diffusion index of private industries, which measures the share of sectors adding jobs (essentially providing a window into how broad-based hiring was), measured 49.6. If the measure is below 50, then more industries lost jobs than added them.\nWhilesome tariff-related price hikes are starting to appear online and in stores(and they\u2019re starting tobear out a little in the inflation data as well), the biggest impact they\u2019ve had on the labor market so far is the uncertainty they\u2019ve caused.\nIn terms of reasons for drags on the labor market, Long puts tariff-related uncertainty as the clear No. 1, followed by a continued post-pandemic normalization and rebalancing of workforces, and then at a far third (for now)the AI effect.\nWages have continued to outpace inflation, but the events of the recent months have kept the Federal Reserve on pause and brought the return of the \u201cK-shaped economy,\u201d where the have-nots are struggling and an upper slice of the haves is driving most of the growth.\n\u201cPeople are really stretched thin,\u201d Long said, adding that continued weakness in the labor market could negatively compound ongoing stressors such as growing household debt.\n\u201cThere simply is not much hiring, white-collar or blue-collar,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that will change if we can get tariff certainty by the end of the summer and a rate cut by September,\u201d she said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/31\/economy\/us-jobs-report-july-preview","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"What to expect in Friday\u2019s jobs report","date":"2025-02-06","body":"If the pundits proved right, the US labor market wassupposed to have broken down by now.\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to survive the Federal Reserve\u2019shistoric and aggressiverate-hiking campaign to reel in high inflation.\nInstead, the job market \u2014 much like the broader US economy \u2014 has remained remarkably strong and has kept rolling right along intoone of the longest periods of employment expansion in history.\nOn Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the January jobs report; and, by and large, economists expect that job gains continued to slow to pre-pandemic norms but remained fairly solid (although, there\u2019s expected to be a fair bit of data-related noise to cut through and analyze \u2026 more on that later).\nThe consensus estimates are hovering around a net gain of 170,000 jobs for last month, according to FactSet. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.\nHowever, the solid and steady labor market appears to be approaching another junction, as well as some obstacles in the road.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a corny phrase, but I think the idea of the labor market being at a crossroads is an apt analogy,\u201d said Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cIt does seem like we\u2019re in \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 mode, to be honest.\u201d\nThe resilient job market is contending with an ongoing pullback in hiring (keeping people on thesidelines for longer), a still-high interest rate environment, and now a cadre ofsweeping policy actionsfrom the White House.\nOne path is the\u201csoft landing\u201d situationwhere the Federal Reserve achieves price stability without tanking the economy. That would likely consist of the economy sailing along, inflation continuing to ease, and no problematic effects from elsewhere, he said.\nThat would allow the Fed to give the economy enough stimulus quickly (bycontinuing to lowerinterest rates) and keep the labor market moving in a positive direction, Allen said.\nRelated articleThese are the fastest-growing job titles, according to LinkedIn users\nAs it stands now, the churn within the US labor market continues to slow: The latest labor turnover data released this week showed hiring remained weak and employers \u2014 especially small businesses \u2014 pulled back on job postings.\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for December showed that the number of available jobs sank to an estimated 7.6 million in December from 8.16 million the month before.\nThe slowdown in job growth has come mostly from reined-in hiring. Layoffs remain at low levels.\nNew data released Thursday showed that job cuts announced in January were the lowest since 2022, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The latest Challenger report tabulated 49,795 announced job cuts last month, which is up 28% from December but down 40% from January 2024.\nInitial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, moved higher last week to 219,000 claims, remaining near pre-pandemic levels, according to new Department of Labor data released Thursday.\n\u201cJanuary was relatively quiet in terms of job cut announcements,\u201d Andrew Challenger, the firm\u2019s senior vice president, wrote in a statement. \u201cHowever, we\u2019ve already seen major announcements in the early days of February, so it seems this quiet is unlikely to last.\u201d\nStill, the current pattern of weak hiring and constrained layoffs leaves little room for maneuvering.\nSo, if there\u2019s a hit to the economy or the labor market, there\u2019s not much of a buffer for it to be absorbed through reduced hiring. If the pressure is significantly intense, it would have to come through layoffs, Pantheon\u2019s Allen said.\nAnd actions from the new administration \u2014 whether ontrade,immigrationor the extent to which federal employment is cut are among the biggest external wild cards now, Allen said.\n\u201cThat leaves us in a situation where things can essentially flip quite quickly, because you\u2019ve already got companies hiring as if they\u2019re in a recession \u2014 even if they\u2019re not laying people off,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the sort of dynamic that feeds on itself quite quickly; that\u2019s the dynamic where you start to get a more significant slowdown.\u201d\nFor now, there remain some strong tail winds building behind the economy and the labor market, said Julia Pollak, chief economist at employment site ZipRecruiter.\nRelated videoWhy a clash between President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell looks inevitable\nThose include real (inflation-adjusted) wage gains for workers; strong earnings for businesses; a fairly strong stock market; and, for some small businesses, a \u201cTrump effect,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what policy exactly or how the Biden administration was upsetting businesses so much, or which taxes or labor provisions were making them so downbeat on the economy and growth,\u201d she said. \u201cBut clearly, every survey shows that businesses are pretty optimistic about 2025 and companies, by and large, expect to expand head count more in the coming six months.\u201d\nBut there also remains \u201ctremendous uncertainty,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThat uncertainty has shifted from what [Federal Reserve Chair] Jerome Powell will do to what [President] Donald Trump will do,\u201d she said.\nFurther restrictions on immigration and deportations, for example, could spur some additional tightness in the labor market, where demand for workers exceed supply. That in turn could spur additional automation or even lower production, she said.\n\u201cWhen confronted with a shortage of labor often substitute for labor, [companies]automate things more,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cThe other thing that might happen is that they reduce production. The cost of labor goes up enough to reduce how much output they can produce or cause them to pivot from more labor-intensive operations to less labor-intensive operations.\u201d\nTrump, via the Elon Musk-spearheaded Department of Government Efficiency, is in the process of gutting some federal agencies. It remains to be seen how deep the job cuts will go, but those offered \u201cbuyouts\u201d have been \u201cencouraged\u201d to find jobs in the private sector.\nGiven the current state of hiring, those prospects are harder, Pollak said, adding that if the severance packages do indeed go through September, that should provide enough time for people to find work.\nEconomists have noted that the January jobs report is among the trickiest to forecast, because it\u2019s typically a big month for job losses: Businesses often let go of hordes of seasonal workers after the holidays and other firms do some belt-tightening to start the year.\nAdditionally, every new year brings statistical refinements to help researchers and economists better see through the seasonal noise such as the timing of moving holidays, the number of weekends in the month and sector-specific boom and down times (think: summer travel and ice cream sales, winter ski activity and retail hiring).\nThe seasonal adjustment factors help to smooth out the data and better understand underlying trends.\nFor example, without the seasonal adjustment, it would seem the US economy suffers a deep economic downturn every January with millions of jobs lost.\nThese seasonal adjustments are based on years of data and trends; however, an economy-upheaving pandemic has thrown a gigantic wrench in those decades-long processes and has even created patterns of its own.\n\u201cThe thing we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is that we\u2019ve tended to have some upside surprises in January; and over the last couple of years, those upside surprises have been quite large,\u201d Allen said in an interview.\nThat can partly be attributed to the volatile hiring activity in the years after the pandemic, he said. But another key factor is that there has been limited snow cover and relatively high temperatures in January of the past three years, he said.\n\u201cThis month, however, looks a little bit different,\u201d he added.\nJanuary\u2019s job gains could be weighed down by the wave of cold and freezing temperatures that settled over much of the US last month, wrote Allen and fellow Pantheon economist Samuel Tombs in an investor note earlier this week. Citing the weather, they expect an increase of only 125,000 jobs.\nThe temperature averaged 37.8 degrees Fahrenheit during the jobs report\u2019s reference week of the 12th \u2014 the lowest since 2015, they wrote.\n\u201cTemperatures have been higher than normal in all seven Januarys in the last eight years when payrolls surged,\u201d they wrote. \u201cConversely, cold snaps in 2009, 2015 and 2016 coincided with subpar payroll growth.\u201d\nJanuary\u2019s jobs report also will provide a clearer look at recent job gains (viathe final benchmark revision) as well as the size and growth of the US labor market (viathe inclusion of new population estimatesfrom the Census Bureau).\nBut first a bit of background: The numbers in Friday\u2019s jobs report most likely will change in the months (and years) to come. That\u2019s just the nature of data collection, statistics and research: There\u2019s a desire \u2014 and, in many cases, need \u2014 to know how the labor market and the broader economy are faring currently.\nEvery year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a thorough review of the survey-based employment estimates from the monthly jobs report and reconciles those estimates with fuller employment counts measured by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program.\nThis annual process, called a benchmarking, provides a near-complete employment count, because the BLS can correct for sampling and modeling errors from the surveys and tie in those estimates to unemployment insurance tax records. The revision process is two-fold:A preliminary estimate is released in mid-August, and the final revision is issued in February,alongside the January jobs report.\nIn August 2024, the preliminary benchmark revision for the 12-month period ended in March 2024was minus 818,000 jobs.That amounts to about 0.5% of the 161 million people employed in the US.\nRelated articleTrump routinely calls economic data \u2018fake.\u2019 Here\u2019s why that\u2019s dangerous\nThat annual preliminary release prompted then-candidate Donald Trumpto call jobs data \u201ca lie.\u201dWhile the 818,000 downward revision, if it stands, would be the largest since 2009, there have been other large revisions in recent years, including adownward revision of 514,000 jobsfor the year ended March 2019 (during Trump\u2019s first presidency).\n\u201cRevisions are not a bug, they\u2019re a feature,\u201d Erica Groshen, a former commissioner atthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, told CNN last month.\nCome Friday, that revision is expected to narrow to about minus 670,000 jobs, according to Pantheon economists, noting an upward revision in the QCEW data as well as adjustments to a BLS model on business openings and closures.\nThe downward revision is likely attributed to the recent surge in immigration.\n\u201cPayrolls will be revised down because many businesses are unwilling to disclose on UI forms that they employ unauthorized immigrants,\u201d the economists wrote. The survey \u201csimply asks businesses how many workers they employ, whereas the UI form asks them to provide each employee\u2019s name and their social security number.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/02\/06\/economy\/us-jobs-report-january-preview","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"When you have to pay your employer money if you quit your job","date":"2025-10-17","body":"Most people go to work for the paycheck and benefits. What they typically don\u2019t expect is to have to returnsome of the moneywhen they leave.\nBut with some benefits \u2014 such as signing or retention bonuses, tuition reimbursement and some forms of training \u2014 workers may have to pay their employer back if they\u2019re subject to a so-called stay-or-pay agreement, which specifies that the employee will be on the hook to repay the company for the cost of certain benefits if they don\u2019t stay at the organization for a minimum amount of time.\nWhy? On the one hand, \u201cemployers are trying to get a reasonable return on their investment,\u201d said Jonathan Crook, a partner at Fisher Phillips, which represents management in labor and employment matters.\nIn other words, paying for benefits intended to attract or retain employees only to have them get the benefit and then quit \u2014 and potentially work for a competitor \u2014 doesn\u2019t offer a great ROI for the employer.\nBut there are some instances when \u201cstay or pay\u201d agreements are viewed as abusive and limiting employee mobility, especially when they apply to lower income workers and involving what are called training repayment agreements (sometimes referred to, especially by critics, as TRAPs).\n\u201cTRAPs are often forced on workers as a condition of employment and require workers who receive on-the-job training \u2014 regardless of the quality or necessity of that training \u2014 to pay back the supposed cost if they leave their job before the end of a specified term,\u201d Chris Hicks, a senior policy adviser at consumer advocacy group Protect Borrowers,wrotein a blog.\nFor instance, they might charge a quitting fee of thousands of dollars, should an employee leave for another job.\nEven if a contract is not enforced, labor advocates say, just knowing of its existence still can pressure employees into staying rather than seeking a better job elsewhere.\nIt\u2019s unclear how widespread stay-or-pay agreements are. Researchers from the University of Michigan, Cornell University and the University of Maryland estimated that such agreements \u2014 including anything from on-the-job training to paying for an employee\u2019s MBA program \u2014 could affect as many as1 in 11 workers (8.7%).\nHistorically, according to a2023 reportfrom the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \u201cEmployers\u2019 use of TRAPs began in the 1990s, predominantly for higher-skilled, higher-wage positions, such as engineers, securities brokers, and airline pilots. Still in use in those industries, they are now also common in lower- and moderate-wage industries where jobs are disproportionately held by women and minorities, such as in the healthcare, transportation, and retail industries.\u201d\nEarlier this week, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law a first-in-the-nationmeasurebanning certain stay-or-pay provisions and putting guardrails around others. It takes effect on January 1, 2026.\nAmong the new prohibitions: California-based employers may not seek repayment for on-the-job training, except for apprentice programs approved by theDivision of Apprenticeship Standards. And they may not seek repayment for any type of benefit when a worker is let go without cause or their job is eliminated.\nBut the new law still allows employers to impose some types of stay-or-pay agreements if they meet certain guardrails. Among those still allowed in addition to approved apprentice programs are signing or retention bonuses, government-sponsored loan repayment assistance and tuition reimbursement but only for \u201ctransferable credentials\u201d (meaning a degree or certificate from an accredited third party that is not specific to the person\u2019s job). In terms of bonuses and tuition reimbursement, if an employee leaves sooner than the stay period, the amount of money they need to repay must be prorated. So if an employee gets a signing bonus but only stays at the company for half the time required, they will only need to pay the company half the amount when they leave.\nEmployees also must have the option to take their bonus when they leave the company rather than when they start, so they don\u2019t risk owing money if they leave before the end of the stay period \u2014 which will now be limited to two years and may not include interest accrual.\nThe move was welcomed by the California Nurses Association, which represents one of the industries in which such stay-or-pay agreements have been used. \u201cWith the threat of having to pay back a debt or fee to their employer, \u2018stay-or-pay\u2019 contracts indenture workers to remain at a job and chills workers from seeking better wages or working conditions,\u201d the union said in a statement.\nIt is too early to predict how the new law will influence the way employers operating across multiple states, including California, might draft their own stay-or-pay provisions, Crook said.\nOr how many other states may follow in California\u2019s footsteps.\nProtect Borrowers notes that there have been legislative efforts to restrict stay-or-pay agreements in several other states, including New York, which passed the \u201cTrapped at Work Act\u201d in June, although it has yet to be signed by Governor Kathy Hochul.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/17\/business\/stay-or-pay-agreements-leaving-job-employer","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"This is why a $15 federal minimum wage is getting love from some Republicans","date":"2025-06-17","body":"A bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.25 is back \u2013 but you might be surprised at who\u2019s leading the charge: Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri.\nShifts in state and local minimum wages, however, as well as the broader economy, show how Hawley\u2019s involvement makes sense, both for his home state and for the country. And experts say having a conservative advocate sponsoring the bill could help the chances of finally getting a federal wage hike for the first time in 16 years.\n\u201cGiven the fact that it\u2019s a Republican leading this legislation, there\u2019s certainly a different tone here, and a different group of people thinking about it than in the past,\u201d said Rebekah Paxton, research director at Employment Policies Institute, a conservative think tank that opposes raising the minimum wage, arguing it will cost the jobs of lower-paid workers.\nThirty-one states already require businesses to pay most workers above the federal $7.25 minimum \u2013 including Missouri. That might be one reason why Hawley\u2019s behind the bill.\nCome January 1, Missouri\u2019s minimum wage will rise to $15 an hour. A higher starting wage means that businesses looking to expand nationwide might instead opt for a state that has a cheaper wage floor. A national $15 per hour wage would level the playing field, making Missouri competitive with places where businesses can legally pay less.\n\u201cI think (Hawley\u2019s sponsorship) is an admission that minimum wage increases are very popular,\u201d said Ben Zipperer, senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that supports a higher minimum wage.\n\u201cI would like to be optimistic about this. I do think it\u2019s an important recognition that the problem with low pay continues to be a concern,\u201d he said.\nThe current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour was set in July 2009,according to the Department of Labor, and has not changed since.\nBut thanks to inflation \u2013 including a surge in prices during the pandemic \u2013 that wage has depreciated. People earning $7.25 in 2009 would need to earn $10.82 today to have the same buying power, according toa Bureau of Labor Statistics calculatorthat uses the Consumer Price Index as an inflation reference.\nAnd while inflation is closer to the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target now, the accumulation of more than a decade and a half of price increases means that Americans simply can\u2019t afford the same kind of life now that $7.25 an hour bought in 2009.\nHawley alluded to that erosion  in a statement about the bill.\n\u201cFor decades, working Americans have seen their wages flatline. One major culprit of this is the failure of the federal minimum wage to keep up with the economic reality facing hardworking Americans every day. This bipartisan legislation would ensure that workers across America benefit from higher wages,\u201d Hawley said in a statement. (Senator Peter Welch, a Vermont Democratic, is a co-sponsor.)\nHawley\u2019s press office did not respond to a request for further comment about the bill.\nIn 10 states, as well as the District of Columbia, workers already make $15 an hour or more. In several more states, the rates could be higher than that next year, depending on inflation adjustments.\nAll those states have Democratic senators likely to support a federal wage hike, excepting only Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine.\nIn fact, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that in 2023, the most recent year with information, only 870,000 workers earn the $7.25 an hour minimum or less (the less is allowed for workers who receive tip income or some workers with disability). That\u2019s only about 1% of the 80 million hourly workers nationwide.\nFar more people, however, make under $15 an hour \u2013 about 14 million, Zipperer said.\n\u201cThe economy has basically moved on\u201d from wages that low, he added. But a pay increase to $15 an hour could do a lot to help those folks.\n\u201cMinimum wage bills are always going to affect a minority of the work force,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, that\u2019s nothing to sneeze at.\u201d\nBut Paxton, of the conservative Employment Policies Institute, said a higher minimum wage could actually hurt those workers by cutting into the number of jobs or hours worked. With human workers earning bigger paychecks, employers could turn to automation or artificial intelligence. Already, AI leaders have warned that new advances in the technology couldslash jobs for white-collar workers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a popular thing. People want to see workers earn more money,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cYes, it could boost wages, but it also could kill jobs for a sizable part of the workforce. There\u2019s a tradeoff we think he (Senator Hawley) is ignoring.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/17\/business\/hawley-fifteen-dollar-minimum-wage","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"One year in, California\u2019s fast food wage hike brings higher pay, debatable job numbers","date":"2025-05-02","body":"Edgar Recinos no longer has to choose between paying rent and buying groceries.\nAs a cook at a Wingstop restaurant in Los Angeles, Recinos got a significant wage bump last year \u2014 one of half a million fast food workers taking part in a great labor experiment.\nCalifornia passed the Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery (FAST) Act in April of 2024 amid vocal support and fierce opposition. The first-of-its-kind policy increased the starting wage for California fast food workers to $20 per hour, which is higher than the overall state minimum wage. It also established a statewide council that sets wage and safety standards at fast food restaurants with more than 60 locations nationwide, like McDonald\u2019s, Jack in the Box, Burger King and Subway.\nBut one year later, the initial impact is a mixed bag. Economists are divided over the effect on employment. Workers do earn more, but many complain their hours have been cut. Fast food restaurant owners tell CNN they have been trimming employee hours and instituting hiring freezes to offset the cost of higher wages.\nRecinos, like many, says his regular hours have been cut. When he doesn\u2019t get to fill in to make up the time, he finds himself \u201cin the same situation before the (wage) increase.\u201d\nAs of March, employment at California\u2019s limited-service restaurants fell 3.1% from the year before, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve using seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s more than 22,600 jobs lost at fast food restaurants that both did and did not fall under the policy.\nWhile that drop is in line with losses in the broader leisure and hospitably sector in the state, it\u2019s a more pronounced downswing than the national trend for fast food restaurants, BLS data shows.\nEconomists are clashing over whether the $20 wage is to blame.\nChristopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics, who publisheda two-page commentaryabout the sector\u2019s losses in March, wrote the findings \u201cundercut much of the recent analysis released by pro-labor groups which have been claiming that the Fast Act has had little impact on (the)limited-service restaurant industry in California.\u201d\nWhile Thornberg told CNN it\u2019s premature to determine if the FAST Act is to blame for the job losses, he is seeing signs of negative cost.\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a costless policy,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery part, every policy must, by definition, have some cost. And it\u2019s up to society to figure out if that trade-off is worth it, right?\u201d\nBut Michael Reich, chair of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley, told CNN there is no evidence the FAST Act is at the root of any job loss.\nReich did hisown analysisof the data, comparing jobs at California\u2019s large fast food chains to those in states where the minimum wage did not change, as well as California\u2019s full-service restaurants and smaller fast food chains not subject to the policy. He says he found \u201cno significant negative employment effect.\u201d\nInstead, he points to California\u2019s population loss and slower economic growth compared to other states among the factors influencing job number fluctuations.\n\u201cIf there are more people, there is going to be more demand for fast food. The different population growth is not because of minimum wage,\u201d Reich said. \u201cSo, if you don\u2019t control for that, you\u2019re looking at a correlation. That\u2019s not a causation.\u201d\nCalifornia fast food workers are now the highest paid in the nation.\nPay for impacted workers jumped 8% to 9% on average since April 2024, according to Reich. They also earn more than other Californians making minimum wage at $16.50 per hour.\nThat kind of money has been life-changing for Selvin Martinez, who works at a Weinerschnitzel in San Jose.\n\u201cBefore the wage increase, I struggled to keep up with expenses. I limited my purchases. I limited what I ate,\u201d Martinez said through an interpreter. \u201cI have been able to cover all of my bills, help my family financially, my savings have grown, and I\u2019m thankful to God, because life feels easier now that I\u2019m not as worried financially.\u201d\nManagement did, however, shift the opening of Martinez\u2019s restaurant one hour later, cutting his weekly schedule shorter by a few hours.\nHe\u2019s not alone. Some workers tell CNN they now work fewer hours.\nIt\u2019s a hard metric to track as economists say there is no reliable data on work hours in fast food. But Recinos, who got a pay bump from $17.25 to $20 in April 2024, says he remembers working more back then.\nRecinos now works about 20 hours a week at Wingstop but fights to get more time on the schedule. He pads his hours by filling in for absent co-workers or during higher-demand periods like the Super Bowl.\nRecinos said managers blame the shorter hours on labor costs.\n\u201cIt makes no sense. Because if you are cutting hours to your current workers, why are you hiring new people and blaming the increase of the wage?\u201d he said.\nThe Wingstop management where Recinos works told CNN they use a standard labor matrix to schedule employees based on business volume and location. Management added that it\u2019s not related to the FAST Act, and they\u2019re committed to providing a consistent schedule and paycheck for their employees.\nWhile the policy has helped some in the workforce, some owners face a different picture.\nKerri Harper-Howie says she\u2019s had to dip into long-term savings for her 40-year-old family business to keep it afloat, with the account down 30% in just nine months.\n\u201cWe have literally been like, \u2018Dowe need to leave California?\u2019\u201d Harper-Howie said.\nThe daughter of a social worker and a police officer, Harper-Howie watched her parents buy their first McDonald\u2019s franchise location in Los Angeles in 1984.Since then, she and her sister have grown the family business into 24 locations \ufeffin Los Angeles County.\nHarper-Howie says sales growth has declined in every single McDonald\u2019s location they own since the FAST Act went into effect \u2014 something that has never occurred in the family\u2019s four decades in the industry.\nAs a result of lower sales, Harper-Howie says they\u2019ve streamlined job duties for employees and cut about 170,000 labor hours. She hasn\u2019t laid anyone off but just lifted a hiring freeze that was in place for the past year.\n\u201cWe put (a supervisor) in charge of going to every restaurant and doing a food cost analysis. Are we giving out too many ketchups? Are we putting too much, too many squirts on the Big Mac?\u201d Harper-Howie said.\nShe also had to increase prices to offset costs. That\u2019s caused employees at neighboring businesses who earn a lower wage to buy less food. Fast food menu prices in California rose by 1.9% relative to the increases in other states over the first six months of the policy, Reich said.\nSales are only now beginning to turn around for Harper-Howie due to a McDonald\u2019s partnership with \u201cThe Minecraft Movie\u201d for toys. \u201cThe Minecraft Movie\u201d is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN.\nHarper-Howie said her family will continue the business fueled on hope.\n\u201cNot \u2018hope\u2019 in like the \u2018racetrack hope,\u2019 but hope rooted in the fact that our family has weathered storms for 40 years,\u201d she said. \u201cI do firmly believe in our brand. I love our brand, and so I\u2019m just hopeful that something is going to get better.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/02\/business\/california-fast-food-wage-hike-one-year-high-prices-jobs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Workers in these states just got a pay raise","date":"2025-01-02","body":"The corks have been popped, the calendar pages turned and a day that promised fresh starts also brought with it some pay bumps for millions of Americans.\nHourly minimum wages increased in 21 states on Wednesday, as part of ongoing efforts to have pay keep up with the rising cost of living or to meet milestones such as a $15-an-hour minimum wage. The increases \u2014 which range from 18 cents to $1.75 (hello, Delaware) \u2014 are expected to affect more than 9.2 million workers, raising their pay by a combined $5.7 billion, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\nAdditionally, about four dozen cities and municipalities (mostly in California, Colorado and Washington) hiked their minimum wages further above their respective state floors, according to EPI.\n\u201cThese additional earnings are critical for ensuring workers don\u2019t lose ground due to rising prices, but the minimum wage level may still be too low, especially if the minimum wage was indexed years ago and not revisited since,\u201d Sebastian Martinez Hickey, a state economic analyst for the EPI,wrote in a recent blog poston the topic.\nAnd that\u2019s especially true after a period of rampant inflation that caused the cost of living to soar even higher.\nThe pandemic and the economic recovery that followed furtherexacerbated the chasmbetween the haves and the have-nots. In turn, labor movement activity has swelled \u2014 as have pushes for a$17 federal minimum wage.\nThe federal minimum wage continues to sit at $7.25 an hour, a rate that hasn\u2019t budged since 2009. As of now, 20 US states have a minimum wage at or below the federal level, with a handful \u2014 Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee \u2014 not adopting any type of wage floor.\nWhile congressional efforts to hike the federal minimum wage stalled out, this past year did see the largest-ever minimum wage increase in recent US history on the state level.\nCalifornia, on April 1, 2024, implemented a sectoral minimum wage hike for fast food workers in the state, raising their base pay by $4 to $20 an hour.\nRelated articleCalifornia just hiked minimum wage for fast food workers. Some restaurants are replacing them with kiosks\nAnd with the sharp increase came some vocal pushback often seen with minimum wage hikes and claims that increases would result in fewer jobs, higher prices and business closures.\nSome of the early-stage research from Harvard University and the University of California Berkeley showed that the new law benefited workers\u2019 well-being while having minimal negative effects on staffing, hours and benefits.\nStill, some restaurants have announced closures or furtheraccelerated the use of technology and kiosksin their restaurants. Federal data shows that job growth in limited-service restaurants in California has been fairly flat in recent months; however, growth in that sector has also dropped off nationally amida broader slowdown in hiringacross the labor market.\nWhile research related to the California law will remain ongoing,a recent study from the University of Michiganfound that minimum wage hikes generally benefit lower-wage workers with minimal impacts to independent businesses. Those typically smaller (and often more vulnerable businesses) were found to offset the wage increases with higher wages as well as higher levels of productivity, according to findings from Nirupama Rao, assistant professor of business administration, and co-author Max Risch.\n\u201cThe hue and cry over the minimum wage is often disproportionate to the actual economic impact \u2014 in terms of how the economy broadly is impacted,\u201d Rao told CNN. \u201cFirms offset [minimum wage increases] with new revenues, but workers get substantially larger incomes.\u201d\nAnd, for those workers, wage boosts can have an immeasurable effect.\n\u201cWhat we find is that earnings go up significantly four years after the minimum wage increase: The typical low-earning workers are earning roughly $1,500 more per year than a similar worker in a state that did not change the minimum wage,\u201d she said. \u201cThis goes without saying but $1,500 to a minimum wage worker is a very large change in their earnings.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/02\/economy\/us-states-minimum-wage-2025","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

But the stock has had a great run\nTesla had already disclosed it had the first annual drop in sales in its history in 2024, but the company\u2019s quarterly revenue of $25.7 billion was about $1.5 billion less than expected. Its net income of $2.5 billion was also a bit below forecasts, even though it was up 3% from a year earlier. But its profit margin of 13.6%, excluding the sale of regulatory credits was much tighter than recent years. Analysts had forecast a 16.2% margin.\nThe company did say that its plans for more affordable models \u201cremain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.\u201d And it said its plans for the rollout of its Cybercab model of driverless robotaxi should be available in 2026. The company has often missed production targets for new vehicles in the past. But those promises, in the notes deep in the earnings report, apparently helped to lift shares off their post-market low immediately after the report\u2019s release when investors were first looking at the topline numbers.\nThe company did not release any target for sales in 2025, although it did say it expects to return to sales growth once again.

Trump has vowed to get rid of a $7,500 tax credit for buyers of new EVs that were put in place during the Biden administration, and end financial support for clean energy efforts. Some of those changes could help Tesla since it could reduce competition from legacy automakers who are ramping up their own EV offerings. But it could reduce the revenue it gets from emission regulation credits that legacy automakers have to buy to comply with existing tougher emissions rules.

The extra supply, along with concern about the economic impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, has weighed on oil this year.\nSupply is rising far faster than demand in the IEA\u2019s view. It expects global oil demand to rise by 680,000 bpd this year and 700,000 bpd next year, both down 20,000 bpd from the previous forecast.\n\u201cThe latest data show lackluster demand across the major economies and, with consumer confidence still depressed, a sharp rebound appears remote,\u201d the agency said in the report, which linked its higher output forecast to increased OPEC+ production targets. \u201cOil market balances look ever more bloated.\u201d\nIEA demand forecasts are at the lower end of the industry range, as the agency expects a faster transition to renewable energy sources than some other forecasters. OPEC on Tuesday maintained its forecast for demand to rise by 1.29 million bpd this year \u2013\u2014 almost double the IEA figure.\nOil prices extended losses after the IEA published its report at 8 a.m. GMT, with Brent crude trading lower than $66 a barrel.\nThe report implies that supply may exceed demand by almost 3 million bpd next year, driven by growth from outside the wider OPEC+ group and a limited expansion in demand.\nDespite higher OPEC+ production, non-OPEC producers will continue to lead supply growth this year and next owing to rising output in the US, Canada, Brazil and Guyana, according to the IEA.\nStill, additional sanctions on Russia and Iran may curb supplies from the world\u2019s third and fifth largest producers, the IEA said.\nThe U.S. announced new sanctions on Iran last month and the European Union lowered a price cap for Russian oil as part of its latest sanctions on Moscow.\n\u201cIt is clear that something will have to give for the market to balance,\u201d the IEA said.\nContinued Chinese stockbuilding due to major institutional and policy developments aimed at enhancing energy security may help absorb the surplus, the agency said.

{"title":"More bad news for Americans battling higher prices: Winter heating bills are about to rise","date":"2025-09-19","body":"This year\u2019s winter heating bills may send a shiver down many Americans\u2019 spine.\nThe cost of staying warm at home is expected to jump an average of 7.6%, to $976 this season, according to anew estimatefrom the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. The spike stems from increases in electricity and natural gas prices, as well as a forecast for a somewhat colder winter.\nThe projection comes as many consumers are still feeling the squeeze from priciersummer electric bills, as well as continued higher costs forgroceries,health insuranceand other essentials. At the same time, the amount of federal assistance available to help people cover their utility bills is expected to remain flat.\nJust how much more Americans will have to pay this winter depends greatly on how they heat their home and where they live, according to the association.\nThose who use electric heat will really feel the burn, sinceelectricity pricesare rising at twice the rate of inflation. These consumers will likely see their bills soar an average of 10.2%, to $1,205 this winter. Some 56 million households heat with electricity \u2014 many of whom live in the South, which is expected to see a spike of more than 21% for this type of heating.\nMeanwhile, the roughly 60 million households who heat their homes with natural gas are projected to pay an additional 8.4%, on average, leaving them with a $693 tab. Midwesterners could see a 16.4% hike, to $698, on average.\nMore than 100 gas and electric utility companies have raised their rates or are proposing to do so for this year or next year, according to arecent reportfrom the left-leaning Center for American Progress. This would affect about 81 million electric utility customers and roughly 28 million natural gas utility customers. Electricity prices are climbing because of increased demand from AI data centers and the need to upgrade grid infrastructure, among other factors.\nTrump just said he solved inflation. But prices are rising - in part because of his policies\nPrior to 2021, winter heating costs were relatively stable, said Mark Wolfe, the association\u2019s executive director. But since then, prices have spiked for electric and natural gas users by 31% and nearly 27%, respectively, with more rate increases on the horizon.\n\u201cCustomers should be prepared for this being a new normal,\u201d he said.\nBut those who use heating oil or propane, which together totals more than 11 million households, will likely catch a break this winter.\nThe cost of heating oil is expected to decline an average of 4%, to $1,455, while propane will likely drop 5%, to $1,250.\nThe increase in winter heating \u2014 and summer cooling \u2014 costs comes as Congress has kept funding for federal assistance for utility bills flat at about $4 billion for the past two years. Lawmakers are proposing roughly the same amount for the coming fiscal year, which starts October 1.\nThis divergence has prompted some states to pull back on their marketing for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, Wolfe said.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is much less outreach going on because they don\u2019t have enough money to serve the population that\u2019s coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they get more people, they have to cut grants. That\u2019s the tension going on.\u201d\nIn Philadelphia, more residents are asking for help with their utility bills, said Charles Lanier, executive director of the Hunting Park Neighborhood Advisory Committee, which connects low- and moderate-income clients with energy assistance and other services. Many are struggling to afford food and other costs, and a growing number are unemployed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re busier than ever,\u201d Lanier said, noting that many folks are hundreds \u2014 or even thousands \u2014 of dollars behind on their utility bills.\nDelaware\u2019s LIHEAP program is also bracing for a flood of requests for assistance this winter after a seeing higher-than expected need this summer, said Sofya Mirvis, chief operating officer for the Energy Coordinating Agency, a nonprofit organization that administers the state\u2019s program.\n\u201cWe are already hundreds of applications in, and the season hasn\u2019t even started yet,\u201d Mirvis said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/19\/economy\/winter-heating-bills-price-increase","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump vowed to halve electricity prices. But they\u2019re rising twice as fast as inflation","date":"2025-09-04","body":"On the campaign trail last summer, President Donald Trump promised to swiftly cut electricity and energy prices in half if voters returned him to the White House.\n\u201cWe intend to slash prices by half within 12 months, maximum of 18 months,\u201d Trump said during acampaign rallyin battleground North Carolina. \u201cYou will never have had energy so low as you will under a certain gentleman known as Donald J. Trump.\u201d\nAlthoughgasoline prices have been lowduring the first year of Trump\u2019s second term, electricity costs are rising uncomfortably fast for a variety of factors, including theinsatiable power needs of massive data centersthat serve as the backbone of the artificial intelligence boom.\nAs of the end of July, electricity prices had surged 5.5% over the prior 12 months, according to theBureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s just over twice the pace of overall inflation, which remains elevated despite Trump\u2019spromises to make prices tumble.\nPower bills are causing sticker shock in some corners of the nation, adding to lingering frustration over the cost of living.\nResidential electricity prices spiked by much more than the national average in Maine (26%), New Jersey (25%), Wyoming (15%), Utah (15%) and Illinois (14%) as of June, according to theUS Energy Information Administration, the analysis arm of the Energy Department.\nAverage residential power prices have fallen in only a handful of states: North Carolina (-1%), Rhode Island (-1%), Idaho (-1%), Hawaii (-4%) and Nevada (-26%).\nCherelynn Baker, an Arizona-based content producer, said her electric bill has nearly doubled over the past year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough adjustment,\u201d she told CNN.\nBaker said it\u2019s been months since she\u2019s been able to pay her electric bill all in one payment, forcing her to break it up in installments. \u201cThis contributes to a daily strain and worry on what bill to pay when\u2026It\u2019s stressful!\u201d\nAbout one in six US households were behind on their energy bills as of March, according toestimatesfrom the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Americans were collectively sitting on about $24 billion in outstanding utility debt.\n\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s Green New Scam agenda crushed America\u2019s energy industry with stifling regulations, causing electricity prices to soar by more than 30 percent in just four years,\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CNN. \u201cBeginning on Day One, President Trump began rolling back these policies and unleashed American energy to lower costs for families and businesses.\u201d\nAnalysts blame the power price hikes on a range of factors joining forces to push up costs.\n\u201cUnusually fast electricity prices are due to a perfect storm involving all market drivers: fast growing demand, supply constraints and infrastructure costs,\u201d said Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group and a former energy adviser to President George W. Bush.\nHistorically, tracking demand for electricity was a boring task marked by little to no change. But that\u2019s not the case anymore.\nSuddenly, demand is increasing rapidly in part because of the rise of electric vehicles and the enormous power needs of AI.\n\u201cThis is a system that is not used to increasing demand,\u201d Dave Turk, former deputy energy secretary under President Joe Biden, told CNN in a phone interview.\nMassive data centers, some larger than footfall fields, are a big part of the demand growth story.\nData center energy usage has tripled over the past decade, according to a late 2024reportfrom the Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\nAI prompts can take up to 10 times more energy to complete than a typical Google search, according toestimatesfrom the Electric Power Research Institute.\nComplex questions to AI systems produced up to six times more carbon dioxide emissions than questions with concise answers, researchers in Germany found in a recentstudy.\nMany experts anticipate this trend will continue, if not accelerate, as AI plays a greater role in society \u2013 consuming more power as AI adoption grows.\nData center energy usage is projected to double or triple by 2028, the Berkeley Lab found.\nTo put it another way, data centers consumed just 4.4% of total US electricity in 2023. By 2028, data centers are expected to consume 6.7% to 12% of total US electricity.\nThat\u2019s one reason the EIA is projecting retail electricity prices to residential customers will increase by 4% this year and then 6% next year.\nAlthough Big Tech companies continue to pour enormous sums of money into power-hungry data centers, there remains significant uncertainty over just how much electricity data centers will use in the future.\nMeanwhile, the supply side of the power question has been complicated by rising natural gas prices.\nAlthough natural gas remains much cheaper than the peak in 2022 after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, prices remain 37% higher than this point last year.\nThat\u2019s significant because natural gas is the leading source of US electricity generation, making up about 40% of the total \u2013 equaling all of coal and renewables combined, according to the EIA. Natural gas is also the leading space-heating fuel in US homes.\nThe cost of natural gas to the electric power industry surged by more than 40% during the first half of 2025,according to the EIA. The cost of natural gas for power generation is projected to rise by another 17% next year, the EIA said.\nAnother expensive problem on the supply side: Aging infrastructure that requires costly repairs and upgrades.\nIn some cases, transmission and distribution facilities were built in the 1960s, or even earlier.\nIn California, which has suffered from a series of deadly wildfires, utilities have been forced to invest in expensive upgrades to lower the risk of fires.\n\u201cAging infrastructure and increased climate risk can threaten reliability if we don\u2019t make necessary infrastructure investments. Those investments end up getting pushed onto consumers,\u201d said Jesse Buchsbaum, a fellow at the Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan research institution.\nAt the same time, the Trump administration hasscrapped plans to retire some coal power plants, citing concerns of an electricity shortage.\nFor instance, in May the Energy Department issued an emergency order requiring that J.H. Campbell, a Michigan coal plant more than 60 years old, stay online. Some local officials warned the move to keep alive the aging coal plant would be costly.\n\u201cIf you artificially force people to keep assets online, it just costs consumers. That\u2019s an own-goal and doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Turk, now a distinguished visiting fellow at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\nEven though Trump has promised to usher in a period of American energy \u201cdominance,\u201d his administration has cracked down on one fast-growing and critical section of the energy industry: Clean energy.\nTrump\u2019s signature spending and tax lawstripped tax incentives for wind, solarand other renewable energy projects.\nThe White House recentlyhalted construction on a nearly finished wind farmoff the coast of Rhode Island. Trump argued last week that \u201cwindmills\u201d are \u201cruining our country\u201d and said he won\u2019t allow them to exist. ButNew England\u2019s grid operator warnedthe decision to pull the plug on the Rhode Island wind farm threatens the reliability of the region\u2019s electric grid.\nRogers, the White House spokesperson, argued that relying on renewable energy is a bad strategy.\n\u201cWhile many states have capitalized on their ability to \u2018drill, baby, drill\u2019 again, Democrat-led states continue to have higher energy prices because of their obsession with unreliable and costly green energy sources like wind and solar,\u201d Rogers said.\nHowever, EIA data shows that some states like Texas and Iowa that use wind to keep the lights on in addition to fossil fuels have relatively cheap power prices.\nBuchsbaum cautioned that taking projects offline can cause challenges for prices and reliability down the line.\n\u201cThere is an important role for renewables in achieving an affordable energy future \u2013 especially wind power,\u201d he said.\nNew England, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut, already suffers from among the highest electricity costs in the nation.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really, really surprised by how little this administration seems focused on affordability and price. They\u2019ve been much more focused on ideology and being reflexively anti-solar and wind,\u201d said Turk.\nThat risks a continued surge in power prices, piling more pressure on the elevated cost of living, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple: Turning on the lights will require more of your paycheck,\u201d said Brusuelas. \u201cThe solution to inflationary bottlenecks is more supply, not less.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/04\/business\/power-prices-trump-inflation","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"See how your energy prices will change because of the GOP tax bill","date":"2025-06-27","body":"Household energy bills will be higher over the next decade now that Republicans have passed their tax and spending bill, according to a new analysis.\nPresident Donald Trump and Republicans are phasing out tax credits that lower the cost to build wind and solar, which are now largely cheaper than fossil fuels like natural gas and coal.\nMore wind and solar on the electric grid helps keep utility bills lower, and Biden-era tax credits would have ramped up those projects.\nWhen combined with the electric vehicle consumer tax credit being cut (you can still get the EV tax credit through September 30, 2025) annual electricity and transportation costs in every state in the continental United States will be higher than they would have if the tax credits stayed intact, analysis from think tank Energy Innovation found. Energy Innovation did not model data for Hawaii and Alaska.\nEnergy Innovation modeled transportation costs like gasoline for cars, as well as household electricity and heating costs in their analysis.\nRed states, including Missouri, Kentucky and South Carolina, could see 13% to 14% higher energy costs by 2035 if Trump\u2019s bill passes, compared to a scenario where the bill didn\u2019t pass.\nAnnual household energy costs could rise $640 a year in Missouri by 2035 and $630 a year in Kentucky. That\u2019s because these states would have otherwise been set to deploy a massive amount of wind and solar if Biden-era energy tax credits were left in place. Now that the GOP bill has been passed aggressively phasing out those credits, these states will have to lean on fossil fuels to generate power.\nBlue states that are deliberately putting more clean energy onto their grids would still see prices rise over the coming decade, albeit far less, Orvis said. They are more immune to price shocks because they won\u2019t be as heavily reliant on gas and coal.\n\u201cYou\u2019re moving from not using a lot of fossil fuels to using a lot of fossil fuels. That makes the price go up a lot,\u201d said Robbie Orvis, Energy Innovation\u2019s senior director of modeling and analysis.\nEnergy analysts expect the cost of natural gas and the cost of building new gas-powered plants will increase, and with it, consumer energy bills.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s electricity prices are going to go up,\u201d said Rich Powell, CEO of trade group the Clean Energy Buyers Association. \u201cI think people have in their minds that gas is a cheap way to generate power. New build natural gas is not a cheap way to generate electricity.\u201d\nPowell\u2019s group was not involved in the Energy Innovation analysis, but has produced their own analysis with NERA Economic Consulting, also finding repealing the tax credits would raise household energy costs.\nPowell added it\u2019s an especially bad time for solar and wind tax credits to go away because there is simply more demand for electricity, with data centers and electrification of homes and vehicles. Since 2022, retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation, according to theUS Energy Information Administration, which predicts they will continue to rise through next year. US natural gas prices have also gone up, and theEIA predictsthey will continue to do so next year.\nOn the transportation side of things, the Energy Innovation model predicts that without a $7,500 consumer tax credit to help defray the cost of electric vehicles, more people will continue to drive gas powered cars.\n\u201cThat increases the spending a lot, plus that gasoline is actually a little bit more expensive because there\u2019s so much more demand for it,\u201d Orvis said.\nRed states will see the biggest price hikes. Oklahoma energy consumers will see their bills rise 13% by 2035, or about $540 in annual costs. Oklahoma is already a wind energy powerhouse, with wind generating close to 44% of the state\u2019s electricity. With the Biden-era energy tax incentives, Oklahoma was set to see another huge spike in wind development that could have made the state\u2019s electricity generation carbon-free, the Energy Innovation modeling found.\nOklahoma could have become \u201ca major exporter of electricity, because there\u2019s so much wind being deployed,\u201d Orvis said. \u201cThe loss of the tax credits means a lot less wind gets deployed, and that\u2019s replaced with in-state fossil resources.\u201d\nSouth Carolina, another state expected to see a 13% price hike in annual energy costs with Trump\u2019s bill, generates a lot of its electricity from nuclear, with natural gas supplying much of the remainder. Orvis said South Carolina stood to add a lot of solar to its electrical grid with tax incentives but would have to revert back to gas once those credits go away.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going from gas setting that price to renewables, and when you undo the tax credits, you see it reverting back to gas,\u201d Orvis said.\nThis story has been updated with a new analysis from Energy Innovation, using the language in the spending bill that was passed by the Senate and House.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/27\/climate\/trump-tax-bill-energy-costs-dg","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"America\u2019s economy faces a new war shock: Surging oil prices","date":"2025-06-22","body":"The American economy faces the unwelcome prospect of reignited inflation after the United States launched strikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran.\nHigh oil and gas prices are a near certainty, experts say. The big question now: How long will the fossil fuels price spike last?\nOil prices are expected to rise by about $5 per barrel when markets open Sunday night, according to experts.\n\u201cWe are looking at $80 oil on the open,\u201d said Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates. US oil hasn\u2019t closed above $80 a barrel since January and has largely hovered between $60 and $75 a barrel since August 2024.\nRelatively tame oil prices have lowered gas prices to below $3 a gallon in many parts of the country, a major source of price relief for inflation-weary consumers.\nIt\u2019s unclear if any major spike in oil prices will be sustained for a long period. Oil prices have risen about 10% since Israel\u2019s surprise attack on June 13 and then fell on Friday after US President Donald Trump announced a two-week deadline on whether to strike Iran.\n\u201cOne shouldn\u2019t necessarily assume that just because the price of oil goes up, it\u2019s going to stay there. It doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for the accounting firm RSM.\nThe direction oil prices take is likely to depend on whether Iran\u2019s parliament decides to block the Strait of Hormuz, a key trade route that accounts for about 20% of the world\u2019s crude oil.\nOn Sunday,Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchisaid his country has \u201ca variety of options\u201d when deciding how to respond to the US attacks and a prominent adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader has already called for the closure of the Strait of Hormuz.\nBob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group and former energy adviser to President George W. Bush, said that should Iran cut off the world\u2019s oil supply by closing the strait it would risk more military force from the United States and its allies.Iran could also attack infrastructure in the Persian Gulf that treats and exports oil and gas.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible they will decide the only thing that can dissuade President Trump is the fear of an oil price spike,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to actually create that fear.\u201d\nAppearing Sunday on Fox News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz,adding that closing it would do more damage to other economies than the US economy. China buys a third of all oil that comes from the Persian Gulf, while the United States buys less than 3%.\n\u201cI encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for their oil,\u201d Rubio said.\nRubio added that closing the strait would hurt other countries\u2019 economies more than the US economy.\nMeanwhile, American consumers may soon feel a price shock at the pump.\n\u201cIt takes five days or so for stations to pass along the prices they see in one day. If oil markets do surge today and then tomorrow, it could start showing up at the pump in a matter of hours,\u201d said Patrick De Haan, vice president of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a fuel tracking platform.\nAccording to Lipow, should the Strait of Hormuz be affected, the price of oil could rise to $100 a barrel, which would raise gas and diesel prices by about 75 cents per gallon from recent levels.\nMeanwhile,US trade policiescombined with the Israel-Iran conflict \u201cstrongly suggest inflation will be moving faster and higher over the next 90 days,\u201d according to Brusuelas. Many mainstream economists argue that the low inflation of the spring represents a calm before the summer storm, when they expect prices to rise because of Trump\u2019s tariffs.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/22\/business\/oil-prices-iran-strikes","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"What the Israel-Iran conflict means for gas prices","date":"2025-06-13","body":"Israel\u2019s unprecedented attack on Iran raises the specter of sharply higher gasoline prices, just as the summer driving season heats up.\nUp until now,pump prices had been low and stable. Relatively cheap gas prices havehelped drive down inflationand offset consumer concerns about sky-high tariffs.\nWhile gas prices tend to rise mildly during the warmer months as people begin their summer vacations, everything has changed sinceIsrael\u2019s stunning strikes on Iran\u2013 an attack that Tehran has vowed to respond to. Analysts say the severity of that Iranian response, and whether it derails the flow of oil out of the Middle East, will help determine just how gasoline prices go.\nOil prices immediately spiked as the market braced for a wider conflict, one that endangers the region\u2019s critical energy supplies. US crude spiked as much as 14% overnight, before pulling back.\nAs of midday on Friday, crude was up 6%, on track for its biggest one-day increase since April 2023. For the week, oil has surged by about 12%, the most since October 2022when OPEC sharply cut oil production.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still at the tip of this situation, but Iran calling the strikes a declaration of war doesn\u2019t bode well for the flow of oil,\u201d said Patrick De Haan, vice president of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a fuel tracking platform.\nDe Haan told CNN that gasoline prices are likely to drift higher over the next few weeks, increasing by about 10 to 25 cents per gallon. The national average for regular gas stood atjust $3.13 a gallonon Friday, according to AAA. That\u2019s down from $3.16 a month ago and well below the year-ago level of $3.46.\nBut pump prices are likely to move significantly higher in the coming days because of the increase in crude prices.\n\u201cI expect gas prices will jump, but not back to record highs,\u201d De Haan said. \u201cBut the risk is that we see Middle East incidents move beyond borders. Will the violence spread? Will the flow of oil be impacted?\u201d\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent oil and gasoline prices skyrocketing in early 2022, eventually driving up gas prices to a record of $5.02 a gallon.\nThankfully, energy prices enter this crisis at relatively low levels.\nThere remains significant uncertainty over just how high gasoline and oil will go because Iran\u2019s response is unclear.\nAnalysts warn that if Iran dramatically escalates the situation by attacking regional energy infrastructure or US military personnel, prices could spike much higher.\n\u201cOil has already spiked\u2026 and its ultimate landing point will likely hinge on whether Iran revives the 2019 playbook and targets tankers, pipelines, and key energy facilities across the region,\u201d Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\nThe big fear is that Iran retaliates by targeting the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow body of water separating the Persian Gulf from global oceans, and themost critical oil chokepoint on the planet. Iran has in the past threatened to do just that.\n\u201cIn the unlikely scenario of Iran disrupting flows through the Strait of Hormuz, we could see a significant supply shock with oil prices rising sharply,\u201d Jorge Le\u00f3n, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, wrote in a report on Friday.\nThat\u2019s becauseabout 21 million barrels of oil flowsthrough the Strait of Hormuz per day, accounting for about one-fifth of the world\u2019s daily consumption, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\nBut Rystad Energy said that if Iran opts for a more \u201climited\u201d response that only focuses on Israeli military sites, the oil market reaction could remain \u201ccontained and temporary.\u201d And that in turn would limit how much gasoline prices increase.\nAny effort to disrupt shipping through the Strait of Hormuz would also have to contend with the US Navy, which is positioned nearby in part due to such a threat.\nCroft, a former CIA analyst, said it would be \u201cextremely difficult for Iran to close the strait for an extended period given the presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain.\u201d\nStill, Croft noted that Iran could attack tankers and mine the waterway to disrupt traffic.\nGoldman Sachs estimates that oil prices could blow past $100 a barrel if there is an \u201cextended disruption\u201d to the Strait of Hormuz, because such an unlikely event could prevent core OPEC producers, like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, from ramping up production.\nHowever, Goldman Sachs views a disruption to the Strait of Hormuz as \u201cmuch less likely\u201d and on Friday only slightly increased its summertime oil price forecast.\n\u201cWe still assume no disruptions to oil supply in the Middle East,\u201d Goldman Sachs strategists led by Daan Struyven, co-lead of the bank\u2019s commodity research team, wrote in a report to clients.\nBut if oil prices continue spiking, several steps could be taken to help supply meet demand.\nOne option is that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations could accelerate recent production increases that began earlier this year.\n\u201cIf oil is caught in the cross-fire,\u201d RBC\u2019s Croft said, \u201cwe anticipate that President Trump will seek OPEC spare barrels to try to keep a lid on prices and shield US consumers from the economic impact of the Middle East conflict.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs assumes that if Iranian oil exports plunge by 1.76 million barrels per day during the conflict, core OPEC+ production would make up half of the Iranian shortfall. In that scenario, Goldman Sachs estimates that Brent crude would climb above $90 a barrel before declining back to between $60 and $70 next year.\nAnother option: The United States and other major oil consumers could release emergency oil stockpiles, as they did in 2022. Former President Joe Biden aggressively drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to prevent gas prices from spiking even higher after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to act if needed,\u201dFatih Birol, executive director of the International\ufeffEnergy Agency,said in apostearlier on Friday.\nBirol said the IEA, which is an intergovernmental organization that coordinates the use of member states\u2019 oil reserves, is \u201cactively monitoring\u201d the situation and noted that the group\u2019s oil security system has more than 1.2 billion barrels of emergency oil stockpiles.\nOPEC, which represents oil producing countries, strongly pushed back at those comments on Friday.\nIn astatementon X, OPEC\u2019s secretary general argued that the IEA statement \u201craises false alarms and projects a sense of market fear through repeating the unnecessary need to potentially use oil emergency stocks.\u201d\nStill, releasing emergency oil is an option that Trump could at least hint at to cool off energy prices if the situation in the Middle East escalates.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/13\/business\/iran-israel-gas-prices-oil","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Cooling your home could hit a record high this summer","date":"2025-05-16","body":"Keeping cool could cost a lot more this summer \u2014 yet another financial squeeze for many inflation-weary consumers.\nAmericans can expect to shell out a record $784, on average, to cool their homes from June through September, according to a new analysis by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association and the Center for Energy Poverty and Climate. That\u2019s up 4.2% from the same period last year and 14% higher than 2020, when folks only paid an estimated $688, after accounting for inflation.\nThe tab is projected to rise both because electricity prices are increasing faster than inflation and another hot summer is in the forecast, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the association, which examined summer cooling costs since 2014.\nResidents of New England and the Midwest will be hit especially hard, with costs projected to increase between 13% and 18% from last year. Only those living in the Pacific, who were expected to shoulder a spike in cooling bills last summer, could catch a break \u2014 with costs forecast to decline nearly 7%.\nAlthoughinflationhas become more muted in recent years, prices remain high andhousehold debt is on the rise. What\u2019s more, escalating costs for both winter heating and summer cooling are putting pressure on Americans\u2019 wallets year-round. Heating bills this past winter, which was a cold one, were expected to jump nearly 9%, according to the association.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t get a chance to catch up,\u201d Wolfe said.\nMore than 21 million Americans \u2014 about one in six \u2014 are behind on their energy bills, the association estimates. Consumers owed their utility companies a total of $24 billion in March, up from $17.5 billion in January 2023.\nFor some people, particularly those with lower incomes, rising costs can have severe consequences \u2014 especially if they are more reluctant to turn on the air conditioning.Heat-related deathsare on the rise, with just over 2,300 people succumbing in 2023, the hottest summer on record, compared to fewer than 1,200 in 2020, according to a study published in the medical journal JAMA.\n\u201cWithout access to affordable cooling, many will be at risk of heat stroke and other health impacts associated with rising temperatures,\u201d Wolfe said.\nAt the same time, the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps about 6 million Americans afford their utility bills, does not have enough funding to aid all those who qualify. LIHEAP is doling out $4.1 billion this fiscal year, down from $6.1 billion two years ago, when Congress provided additional support in the wake of soaring energy prices during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOnly 26 states offer summer cooling assistance through LIHEAP, Wolfe said.\nIn hisbudget blueprint, released earlier this month, President Donald Trump proposed eliminating the program. The White House said it isn\u2019t necessary in part because states have policies preventing utility disconnections for low-income residents, which it argues means LIHEAP mainly benefits utilities.\nOnly 19 states and the District of Columbia offer summer shutoff protections, covering about half the US population, Wolfe said.

{"title":"Tariffs will lift US gas prices within days","date":"2025-02-03","body":"The tariff on products imported from Canada will cost Americans 15 cents a gallon or more at the gas pump relatively soon. That\u2019s not as much of a price hike as we could have seen.\nTariffs on US imports from Canada and Mexico were announced Saturday by the Trump administration and are set to take effect on goods arriving here Tuesday, as President Donald Trump followed through on a campaign promise by taking action against America\u2019s two biggest trading partners. But then on Monday he put the Mexican tariffson hold.The tariffs, a tax on goods crossing the border, will affect the price Americans will pay for all manner of imports from the countries, including cars, lumber and agricultural products. But gasoline and other energy products could be among the first to see the expected price increases.\nOne factor limiting the price increase is the tariffs on energy products is only 10%, not the 25% tariff announced on other products from Canada. A Trump administration official told reporters on Saturday that a lower tariff on energy was done to spare Americans from from having to pay even more for gasoline and heating oil, even though President Donald Trump has long insisted, incorrectly, that it is the foreign nation, not Americans, who pay the cost of any tariffs that are imposed.\nRelated articleTariffs are coming \u2014 in full force. US stocks are taking a tumble\n\u201cWe took this step simply because\u2026 a 10% rate on energy will minimize any disruptive effects we might have on gasoline and home heating oil prices,\u201d said the administration official, who spoke on condition he not be identified.\nWholesale gasoline prices were up 8 cents a gallon on trading markets early Monday, said analyst Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates. And the price at the pump could go up even more as the cost of the tariffs are added on top of the increase in market prices. The average price of a gallon of gas stood at about $3.10 a gallon as of Monday, according to AAA, unchanged from Sunday\u2019s price reading.\nDiesel prices were trading up 10 cents a gallon. Higher prices for diesel could lead to a fuel surcharge by trucking companies, which could bleed through to the price of goods, since virtually every item in Americans\u2019 homes were on a truck at some point. And it could also raise the price of heating oil, which is the same basic product as diesel fuel.\nMarket prices for wholesale gasoline are up because traders are expecting some of the crude oil and gasoline now being imported from both Canada and Mexico will end up being diverted to other markets, causing some shortages in the United States. Oil futures are up 2% to 3% in Monday morning trading. One reason that they\u2019re not up more is that futures contracts are for purchases of oil to be made in the next few months, and some investors are betting that the tariffs will end up being short-lived.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be some short-term price increases at the pump.\n\u201cWhat you are seeing is a great reshuffling of oil about to begin,\u201d Lipow told CNN Monday. Higher prices might not happen overnight, he said, but, \u201cYou\u2019ll see something at the pump in the next five to seven days. Depending on where you are in the country, it could be up to another 15 cents a gallon.\u201d\nSince Canada is the largest source of imported oil and gasoline into the US market, it\u2019s been getting much of the attention. But Mexico is also a major exporter of both oil and gasoline to the United States.\nMonday morning, however Trump announced the tariffs on imports from Mexico would beon hold for a monthafter a call he had with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.\nIf the tariffs go into effect on Mexican goods, it could have its own impact on gas, diesel and oil prices, even if Mexican has only a fraction of the petroleum exports to the United States as sent here from Canada.\nUnlike a lot of Canadian petroleum products that arrive here via pipeline and is difficult to divert to another market, Mexican oil and gasoline arrives primarily via ship, so it can easily be sold elsewhere. Oil exports to the United States via ship from either country are likely to be quickly sent to other markets once tariffs are in place. according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs on Sunday.\n\u201cExpect the bulk of the previously seaborne Canadian and Mexican exports to the US to be rerouted,\u201d it said in its Sunday note, ahead of the news about Mexican tariffs being put on hold.\nBut the good news for American consumers is that many oil producers in Western Canada have little alternative for their oil other than sending it to US refineries via existing pipelines. That could make it difficult for those producers to pass on the full cost of the tariffs to their US customers, said the note from Goldman Sachs. But some of that cost of tariffs will be borne by US customers.\n\u201cWe expect Canadian oil producers to eventually bear most of the burden of the tariff with a $3 to $4 a barrel wider-than-normal discount on Canadian crude given limited alternative export markets, with US consumers of refined products bearing the remaining $2 to $3 a barrel burden.\nOne factor limiting the price shock at the pump is the time of year. Gas prices are typically near a low for the year in February due to weak demand, said said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS. The current seasonal weakness in energy prices could limit the bite at the pump.\nIf the tariffs stay in place through summer, the impact will be greater, he said, causing not just pain in people\u2019s wallets on a small scale, but inflation on a larger level.\n\u201cIt\u2019s inflationary, but not as inflationary as it would be in April, May or June,\u201d Kloza told CNN late Saturday. \u201cWe are using about 1 million barrels a day less gasoline on February 1 than on July 1.\u201d\nThe impact will not be felt equally nationwide, because most Canadian oil is shipped to Midwest refineries via pipeline, Kloza said. The states served by those refineries are Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, North Dakota, South Dakota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\u201cInterestingly, 12 of those 16 states begin February with an average retail gasoline price under $3 a gallon,\u201d he said. \u201cThat probably won\u2019t last.\u201d\nNew England gets a lot of gasoline from a refinery run by Irving Oil in Saint John, New Brunswick. That also can be shipped elsewhere, so the diversion of that gasoline could send gas prices in New England up 20 cents a gallon, said Lipow.\n\u2013 CNN\u2019s Matt Egan and Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/02\/03\/business\/tariffs-gas-prices","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"What to expect for gas prices in 2025","date":"2024-12-30","body":"More good news is coming to inflation-weary drivers: Gas prices are expected to drop in 2025 for the third straight year, according to GasBuddy projections shared exclusively with CNN.\nGasBuddy, which has accurately forecasted gas prices the past several years, expects thenational average for regular gasto fall to $3.22 a gallon next year.\nThat would mark a modest decline from about $3.33 in 2024 and mark the lowest annual average since 2021.\nThe forecast formuted prices at the pumpis a far cry from the spike above $5 a gallon nationally in mid-2022, anunprecedented surgethat rocked the American economy, crushed consumers and became the epicenter of the inflation crisis.\nBased on the new forecast, GasBuddy expects Americans will spend about $115 billion less on fuel in 2025 than they did in 2022.\n\u201c2025 looks to continue the trend of slow-but-steady improvement at the pump,\u201d Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy\u2019s head of petroleum analysis, told CNN in a phone interview.\nGasBuddy expects the national average will stay safely below $3.50 a gallon each month of 2025, even during the peak driving season of late spring and early summer.\nThe typical household is expected to spend $2,252 next year on fuel. That would be above the pre-Covid level of $1,952 in 2019 but well below the record high of $2,715 in 2022.\nHowever, De Haan warned that this projection for tame gas prices could be disrupted by several X-factors, including President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\u201cTrump is a bit of a wildcard. He tends to destabilize the status quo and that increases risk and makes it harder to predict prices,\u201d said De Haan.\nGas prices, highly visible and difficult for many to avoid, play an outsized role in how Americans feel about the economy and their financial health. They serve as a real-time barometer for the cost of living and influence consumer psychology.\nTrump has vowed to attack the cost of living by embracing American energy dominance. Trump wants to slash environmental regulations and ramp up permitting in an effort to boost the supply of oil and natural gas.\nAlthough gas prices have dropped sharply from mid-2022, Trump promised on the campaign trail to make them go much, much lower.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get gasoline below $2 a gallon,\u201d Trump said during a speech in September, though he did not specify when prices would fall that low.\nHowever, industry veterans arehighly skeptical of that claim\u2013 unless there is a recession or some other crisis on the way that crashes demand.\nGasBuddy is forecasting prices will stay well above $2 a gallon throughout 2025. Even at the cheapest end of the range of possible monthly prices, GasBuddy only expects the national average to fall to $2.81 in December 2025.\n\u201cOur figures are not even on the same planet as what the President-elect has promised,\u201d De Haan said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t see the stars aligning for President-elect Trump to realize gas prices that low.\u201d\nAlthough Trump\u2019s drill-baby-drill focus could boost domestic production, the United States is already pumping more oil than any nation in world history.\nIt\u2019s not clear that production can go dramatically higher, nor that there is even demand for substantially more crude given how subdued prices are now.\nRob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at energy investment firm Tortoise Capital, told CNN that there is a risk unleashing too much supply will cause a glut, hurting energy prices and the oil-and-gas sector.\n\u201cThis is why economics, not politics, will drive the energy sector,\u201d Thummel said.\nOf course, calls for gas prices to drop in 2025 could prove wrong if there is a natural disaster or geopolitical trouble that disrupts supplies.\nFor example, an even wider crisis in the Middle East that includes Iran or even Saudi Arabia could drive oil prices sharply higher.\nAnother risk is that Trump goes forward with his threat to impose a25% tariff on Canadaand Mexico on his first day in office.\nYet Canada is the leading source of America\u2019s foreign oil.\nLast year, the United States imported 1.4 million barrels of Canadian crude oil per day, accounting for more than half of total oil imports.Another 733,000 barrelsof Mexican crude were imported each day last year as well, according to federal data.\nGasBuddy\u2019s De Haan estimates that a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico would lift retail gas prices by 30 cents to 70 cents a gallon.\nBut a spike in gas prices is the last thing Trump would want voters to see when he takes office.\nThat\u2019s why GasBuddy assumes in its 2025 forecast that Trump will ultimately not slap a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican oil.\nOfficials in Canada and Mexico have promised to respond to Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs, raising the specter of a tit-for-tat tariff battle that derails the closely-integrated North American economy.\nDe Haan said a full-blown trade war would likely dent demand for fuel, driving prices lower.\n\u201cIf we saw $1.99 gas,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be because of an economic calamity, not something Americans would cheer.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2024\/12\/30\/business\/gas-prices-trump-2025-gasbuddy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"There\u2019s no denying it now: Tariffs are raising prices","date":"2025-05-16","body":"A version of this story appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nDonaldTrump\u2019s pitch to Americans on the campaign trail last yearincluded a simple (and simplistic) promise: lower prices on Day One. Even if he didn\u2019t mean it literally, it\u2019s now Day 115, and the results of his only significant economic policy show that the opposite is happening.\nThursday brought an avalanche of data that all point to one outcome: Prices are going up. Just ask Walmart.\nIf there\u2019s one company in the world that could theoretically take tariffs on the chin, it\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest retailer, which can (and does) use its scale to pressure suppliers to keep prices low for shoppers.But Walmart said Thursday that US tariffs \u2014 as a reminder: those are taxes that American businesses pay on imported goods \u2014 are too high, andit is raising prices in response.\n\u201cGiven the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren\u2019t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday on an earnings call. \u201cThe higher tariffs will result in higher prices.\u201d\nRelated articleWalmart warns it will raise prices because of tariffs\nWalmart has no political incentive to do this \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s taking a risk by so publicly tying its price hikes to tariffs, something thatAmazonandMattellearned the hard way tends to enrage the president. And this is not a story of corporate greed run amok, because Walmart would be foolish to try to gouge its customers at a time wheneconomic anxietyis high (more on that in a moment).\nThis is just what happens when a government puts 10% baseline tariffs on all imports. The money has to come from someone\u2019s pocket, and that someone is generally the company importing the things or the consumer buying the things, or both.\nYou may be thinking, \u201cWhatever, I went to Walmart\/Target\/Home Depot this week and everything was fine.\u201d And that\u2019s probably true, because retailers across the board stockpiled as much as they could to get ahead of Trump\u2019sApril 2 tariff rollout. But as those inventories wind down, the more-expensive goods ordered after April 2 will hit the shelves. (For Walmart, that\u2019s expected to happen next month.)\nAnother reason consumers have been insulated: Businesses are already absorbing the costs, according to thelatest gauge of US wholesale inflation, known as the Producer Price Index. Last month, wholesale prices actually fell, which sounds like a good thing until you look a little closer atwhy.\nThe dip in the PPI came from a plunge in \u201ctrade services,\u201d a category that measures profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. Essentially, that means producers are letting higher input costs eat into their profit margins while they try to figure out what to do.\nConsumers are in a similar boat. Like the corporations, customers saw tariffs coming andmoved quickly to try to front-run them, snapping up cars, electronics and home goods in March.\nNow, though, they\u2019repulling backeven more than economists expected. Consumer spending data for April was just barely positive year-over-year, rising 0.1%.\nTogether, these indicators \u2014 Walmart\u2019s price hikes, April wholesale prices and consumer spending data \u2014 all tell the same story: The tariff \u201cpain\u201d that Trump warned about (only after taking office) is here.\nThese indicators are also among the first pieces of \u201chard data\u201dto confirm that Americans\u2019 behavior is starting to match their mood. (Those things don\u2019t always align. Like when inflation was surging a few years ago, folks tended to tell pollsters that the economy was terrible, but they also continued to spend money like everything was great \u2014 akathe vibecession.)\n\u201cWe are beginning to see the impact of trade policy filtering into the hard data in such a way that it\u2019s impossible to deny that it is now affecting revenues and profit margins for firms,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US,toldmy colleague Alicia Wallace.\nBut wait! There\u2019s more. The Silver Foxes of Finance also weighed in Thursday.\nJamie Dimon, the head of America\u2019s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase,told Bloomberg Newsin an interview that he\u2019s not counting on the US getting out of 2025 recession-free. And he even suggested America\u2019s longstanding status as the world\u2019s financial safe haven is not guaranteed. (\u201cYou do not have a divine right to success,\u201d the billionaire bank CEO said.)\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile,warnedthat \u201cwe may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks.\u201d (Read: Prices are going to be a lot more volatile, up and down, making it much harder for the central bank to do its job.)\nTo be sure, there are some areas where prices are actually going down.Eggs, as the president is fond of noting, are getting cheaper. Ditto airfare, gas, sporting event tickets and hotel rooms. Unfortunately, those prices are coming downbecause demand is going slack. People don\u2019t book vacations when they\u2019re not confident about their income.\nBottom line: We\u2019re in it now, folks.\nStay tuned: Friday adds some fresh \u201csoft data\u201d to our simmering economic stew. Consumer sentiment \u2014 what consumers say about how they feel \u2014 measured by the University of Michigan has been falling steadily since January. It\u2019s possible, given the timing of the survey, that we may seea bit more optimismin response to last weekend\u2019sunexpected detentewith China.\nAnd next week, Target, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s report earnings and financial forecasts that should tell us more about how tariffs are hitting their bottom lines.\nCNN\u2019s Nathaniel Meyersohn, Alicia Wallace, Bryan Mena, Elisabeth Buchwald and Matt Egan contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/16\/business\/tariffs-walmart-prices-nightcap","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The new research, published Monday, looked at 16 examples across 18 countries around the world where prices spiked in the short term as a result of either extreme heat, drought or heavy precipitation between 2022 and 2024.\nRelated articleClimate change is disrupting food systems across Latin America, UN report says\nThe price of vegetables rose by 80% in California and Arizona in November 2022, compared with the previous November, as the western US states suffered extreme heat and water shortages over the summer of 2022.\nCabbage prices in South Korea were 70% higher last September than a year earlier following a heatwave in August.\nThe price of olive oil shot up by 50% in Europe in January 2024 after a prolonged drought across Italy and Spain in 2022 and 2023,while one of the most severe droughts that Mexico has faced over the last decade also led to a 20% increase in fruit and vegetable prices that month.\nRice prices soared by 48% in Japan in September 2024 in the wake of aheatwave that was the hottest since regional records began in 1946, bar the equally hot summer of 2023.\nGhana and Ivory Coast account for almost 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa production. So a heatwave there in early 2024 that scientists say was made 4 degrees Celsius hotter by climate change saw global cocoa prices rise by a massive 280% in April that year.\nHealthy food tends to cost more than less healthy alternatives, so a jump in food prices can often lead low income households to cut back on nutritious food like fruit and vegetables, the new study said.

He adds that Saudi Arabia, Oman and Bahrain will feel the most pain, with countries like the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait less affected.\nOf all Middle Eastern economies, Saudi Arabia\u2019s is the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d to low oil prices, James Swanston, Middle East and North Africa Senior Economist at Capital Economics, told CNN.\nThe country is the world\u2019s top oil exporter. The commodity accounted for 60% of government revenue in 2024, with crude oil and natural gas accounting for more than 20% of the country\u2019s GDP over the same period.\nA per barrel price of above $100 is required for the country to balance its budget, Swanston said.\nCallen, who is the former International Monetary Fund chief to Saudi Arabia, estimates that with oil at $60 a barrel, Saudi Arabia\u2019s fiscal deficit would be $62 billion, more than double the $27 billion estimated in its annual budget.\nAcross the region, governments are utilizing oil revenues to diversify their economies.\nIn Saudi Arabia, several initiatives dubbed \u201cgiga-projects\u201d are key to the country\u2019s Vision 2030 plan. That includes the futuristic city of NEOM, intended to be a hub for everything from manufacturing to media. The first phase will cost hundreds of billions of dollars, according to its crown prince.\nOther initiatives include the development ofluxury tourism destinationsalong the country\u2019s Red Sea coast, and Qiddiya, an entertainment city on the outskirts of Riyadh. Since 2016, $1.3 trillion in real estate and infrastructure projects have been unveiled, according to Knight Frank\u2019s Saudi Arabia Giga Projects Report.\nExperts say that some giga-projects may now face delays, if the country cuts back its capital expenditure.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is behind Neom and the Red Sea tourism plans, did not respond to a CNN email.\nInfrastructure needed for major international events may get priority. The country plans to host the 2029 Asian Winter Games, the 2030 World Expo, and the 2034 FIFA World Cup.\nIn recent years, Saudi-led OPEC has limited output to boost oil prices, holding Brent crudeoil to largely $70 to $90 per barrel. But there have been tensions within the membership and wider OPEC+ group, with countries like Kazakhstan and Iraq exceeding their production quotas \u2014 and the issues don\u2019t appear to be resolved.\nThe organization\u2019s April 3 output-increase announcement may have been intended to punish overproducers, experts say. In mid-April, OPEC released a plan to compensate for overproduction. But last week, Kazakhstan\u2019s energy minister told Reuters that national interests would take priority over those of OPEC+. His comments drove a decline in prices, and he later issued a statement saying the country is committed to work with the group.\nThe continued flouting of production quotas could keep oil prices sagging, even after US President Donald Trumpsignalled a potential U-turnon his trade war with China.\nLower oil prices could mean that Saudi Arabia\u2019s diversification away from oil takes longer than planned, says Swanston.\nCallen says that Saudi is still in an \u201cenviably strong\u201d fiscal position with relatively low public debt levels. The Kingdom can deal with lower oil prices by cutting back spending and borrowing more, he adds. \u201cNot ideal for Saudi, but very manageable.\u201d\nSwanston says that Saudi Arabia has some of the lowest oil production costs in the world, and that the country may be able to withstand price levels that those with higher costs cannot. \u201cTheir cost of production is minuscule,\u201d says Swanston. \u201cThey can weather lower prices.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/28\/business\/oil-prices-saudi-arabia-tariffs-opec-spc-hnk-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The blowup of First Brands, an auto parts supplieraccused of fraud, and Tricolor, a subprime auto lender, had been haunting investors for weeks.\nThe concern is less about those businesses failing than it is about major banks\u2019 exposure to them \u2014 and whether banks have been overlooking risks in private credit, where less-regulated non-bank entities lend money.\nThose fears crystallized when Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, revealed that his bank would take a $170 million loss on its loans to Tricolor. Dimon hinted more trouble could be coming, warning analysts that \u201cwhen you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\u201d (Ew!)\nWhy Jamie Dimon is warning of \u2018cockroaches\u2019 in the US economy\nWith everyone\u2019s skin effectively crawling from that imagery, then came the pair of regional banks with their spooky update.Zions Bancorp and Western Alliancedisclosed that they were victims of a fraud on loans linked to distressed commercial mortgages \u2014 three words that should make anyone who lived through 2008 immediately start sweating. The news set off a panic, and regional bank sharestumbledon Thursday.\nFor a moment, it looked like a potential credit crisis was about to become the bogeyman that would end Wall Street\u2019s three-year bull run in stocks.\nBut only for a moment.\nBy Friday, the tension vanished like a ghost and investors got back to gobbling up equities. And byMonday\u2014 after the White House signaled the shutdown could end this week and corporate earnings season switched into high gear \u2014 it was as if Thursday\u2019s panic was all just a bad dream.Subprime what? Tricolor who?\nIf there was any fear lingering in the market, the allure of Big Tech returns and excitement for a likely Federal Reserve rate cut next week drowned them out, prompting investors to buy the dip.\nTo be sure, the risks in the private credit market haven\u2019t gone away. Investors are just choosing to put their focus elsewhere for the moment, while keeping their heads on a swivel for any further signs of turmoil.\nThe consensus among analysts seems to be that the troubles at Tricolor, First Brands and the two banks, look more like isolated cases of potential fraud and poor risk management than harbingers of the next financial crisis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to get one\u2019s spidey sense tingling a little bit, but it\u2019s not necessarily fair to assume the worst right now,\u201d Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told me.\nBuying the dip has proven to be a profitable strategy, after all. And investors who weathered the banking crisis of 2023 may be feeling confident that the Federal Reserve would, once again, step in to prevent systemic collapse.\nOf course, the market\u2019s eagerness to assume the best could be pushing traders into Pollyanna-ish territory.\n\u201cIf this is more of an infestation, to extend Jamie Dimon\u2019s analogy, the market\u2019s not ready for it,\u201d Sosnick said, \u201cbecause it was so quick to shrug off the problems \u2026 If there are more cockroaches, that\u2019s systemic and that is problematic.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/20\/business\/wall-street-banks-stocks-spooked","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Wall Street has been worried about bad loans for weeks. Now those fears are spreading","date":"2025-10-17","body":"Several financial groups are wrestling with bad loans, raising worries on Wall Street of more to come.\nFor weeks, investors have focused on Jefferies Financial Group, an investment bank that has at least $45 million worth of exposure to First Brands, an auto-parts supplier that filed for bankruptcy last month.\nBut on Thursday, they turned some of their attention to two regional banks, Western Alliance Bancorp and Zions Bancorp, after concerns about some of their loans as well.\nAll three banks\u2019 stocks suffered their steepest single-day losses in over six months on Thursday. Thatanxiety played outin the market at large as well, with the Dow shedding 0.65% that day. Meanwhile, investors flocked to safe havens, including US Treasuries, gold and silver.\nIf all this is bringing back memories of the 2023 regional banking crisis, you\u2019re not alone. For now, it\u2019s unclear if there\u2019s a risk to the broader market or if this is just a few bad eggs.\nJefferies, like several other financial groups, offered funding to First Brands through third-party factoring, which is when a business promises to repay lenders when one of its customers pays an outstanding balance.\nBut creditors allege First Brands used the same invoice multiple times to access funds from private lenders that were unaware of the double dipping. Translation: Lenders like Jefferies might not have provided financing to First Brands if they had had a more complete picture.\nAll told, Jefferies\u2019 $45 million exposure to First Brands represents less than 5% of its pre-tax income from last year, meaning its exposure to First Brands alone is unlikely to cause it to shutter.\nJefferies CEO Rich Handler and president Brian Friedman stressed that in a statement issued earlier this week aiming to calm investors.\nBut investors seem more concerned about whether Jefferies missed warning signs in this case, which reportedly is being investigated by the Department of Justice for potential fraud, and if it\u2019s missed similar signs elsewhere. The company declined to comment.\nBoth stocks sank by over 10% on Thursday following disclosures that they lent to businesses they claimed defrauded them.\nZions (ZION) said in a Wednesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it anticipates losing $60 million as a result.\nWestern Alliance (WAL) didn\u2019t share how much it expects to lose. Instead, it shared in a Thursday morning filing that it \u201cinitiated a lawsuit alleging fraud by the borrower.\u201d Because of this, it said it now has more loans at risk of not being repaid.\nRepresentatives from Zions and Western Alliance didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.\nAs JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said this week, before details emerged about Zions and Western Alliance:\u201cWhen you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\u201d\nAnd JPMorgan isn\u2019t exactly in the clear either. It\u2019s poised to suffer $170 million from soured loans to Tricolor, another company that declared bankruptcy last month. JPMorgan is the nation\u2019s largest bank, and lawyers representing the trustees of bankrupt Tricolor have alleged that the company was engaged in fraud,Bloomberg has reported.\nBut the question is: How many other cockroaches are there?\nCorrection: An earlier version incorrectly stated the status of Tricolor\u2019s bankruptcy case. Lawyers representing the company\u2019s trustees have reportedly accused the company of fraud.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/17\/economy\/bank-loans-fraud","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Wall Street looks past US deficit concerns for now as investors snap up bonds","date":"2025-06-12","body":"Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief Thursday after a key bond auction eased concerns that the US economy might be falling out of favor with investors.\nBonds rallied after an auction for US government bonds saw relatively strong demand. The Treasury on Thursday sold $22 billion worth of 30-year bonds. The auction settled with a yield of about 4.84%, signaling solid buying.\nStandard, boring bond auctions have drawn the attention of investors around the globe. The auctions serve as a gauge of investors\u2019 appetite for holding US debt as lawmakers debate President Donald Trump\u2019s massive bill, which is set to add to thefederal debt burden.All eyes have been on whether there is weak demand for long-term debt, particularly from foreign investors.\n\u201cThe 30-year auction just went very well,\u201d Chip Hughey, managing director for fixed income at Truist Advisory Services, told CNN.\nThere was relatively strong demand from foreign investors, Hughey said, soothing nerves about whether they might be shunning US bonds.\nForeign investors bought about 65.2% of the bonds sold at the auction, according to Treasury Department data, up from 58.9% at the auction in May. Demand from foreign investors was the strongest it has been since January and hovered around the one-year average.\nCollin Martin, a fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNN that the uptick suggests foreign demand for long-term US assets remains strong despite concerns about foreign investors potentially selling Treasuries and nerves about the rising deficit likely resulting from Trump\u2019s mega bill.\nRelated articleThe White House has been obsessed with tariffs. Wall Street is wondering about Trump\u2019s tax cuts\n\u201cThis was a good confidence boost for those worried about declining demand for US Treasuries,\u201d Martin said.\nTruist\u2019s Hughey said the solid auction results showed that at least for now, investors are not overly panicked about federal budget negotiations in Congress or the deficit.\n\u201cOver the long term, our deficits and reliance on debt are going to have to be addressed,\u201d Hughey said. \u201cFor the time being, it is encouraging to see investors still seeking out US Treasuries for their haven assets.\u201d\nThe auction followed a similarly strong auction for 10-year Treasuries on Wednesday.\nThe Treasury auction also came after two inflation reports that showed the effect of tariffs has so far been muted. That increases the likelihood the Federal Reserve can consider cutting interest rates later in the year, which is a signal for investors to buy bonds now to lock in current rates, helping bring down yields.\nThe 30-year yield settled on Thursday around 4.84% and the 10-year yield settled around 4.36%. Both fell across the day as investors snapped up bonds.\nThe 30-year Treasury auction, which is a regularly scheduled event, has become a closely watched barometer forhow Wall Street is feelingabout the Trump administration\u2019s policy agenda.\nWhen there is strong demand for bonds, prices rise and yields fall. Vice versa, when there is weak demand for bonds, prices fall and yields rise. Higher yields would squeeze the government with higher borrowing costs. Treasury yields are also benchmark interest rates for the economy, and higher yields can mean higher borrowing costs for consumers on everyday items including auto loans and credit cards.\nLong-term US debt, which is usually considered the safe, risk-free corner of the market, has come under scrutiny as Trump\u2019s bill is set toadd to increase federal deficits.\n\u201cThe idea that the US fiscal position is unsustainable over the long run has been frequently noted for years, but it has taken the current set of circumstances to get market participants to begin pushing back,\u201d John Canavan, lead US analyst at Oxford Economics, said in a Wednesday note.\nYields on 30-year Treasury bonds have soared this year as investors have demanded more compensation for what is looking like a riskier long-term loan to the US government. These concerns were exacerbated in May after Moody\u2019s downgraded the US, stripping the nation ofits last perfect credit rating.\n\u201cThe Moody\u2019s downgrade occurred as the ability to easily finance growing deficits increasingly comes into question,\u201d Canavan said. \u201cTrump\u2019s tariff decisions are likely to raise inflation over the near term, while lowering economic growth and leading foreign investors to question the safe-haven allure of Treasury debt.\u201d\nIn May, the 30-year yield spiked above 5% and hit its highest level since 2023 after a Treasury auction for 20-year bonds thatsaw weak demand.\nThere is robust demand for shorter-term Treasuries like 10-year bonds, according to Hughey. An auction for 10-year Treasuries on Wednesday saw strong demand from both domestic and global investors.\nYet investors in recent weeks hadshown hesitancyabout longer-duration bonds like the 30-year bond, Hughey said. Investors have been increasingly uncertain about the long-term outlook for the US debt burden, giving them pause about the risk associated with loaning money to the government over a longer period.\n\u201cThe 30-year reflects the uncertainties around those more structural questions around budget deficits and the US debt load going forward,\u201d Hughey said.\nPacific Investment Management Company, a global fixed income firm, said in a Tuesday report that bonds still look relatively attractive and affordable compared to stocks. However, Pimco expects to focus and be \u201coverweight\u201d to 5- and 10-year bonds, while being less focused and \u201cunderweight\u201d to longer-term bonds.\nMartin at Charles Schwab said that while concerns about the deficit linger, investors are also assessing factors like inflation and the path of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.\n\u201cWe still find yields pretty attractive, and our outlook on the safety of US Treasuries hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Martin said.\nElsewhere in markets, US stocks gained on Thursday as investors tried to digest recent trade developments. The United States and China havede-escalated tensions, but Trump\u2019s tariffs still remain a headwind to economic growth.\nThe Dow closed higher by 102 points, or 0.24%. The broader S&P 500 rose 0.38% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.24%.\nThe S&P 500 is hovering near an all-time high, but had stalled in recent trading sessions and was coming off a day in the red. The benchmark index is about 1.6% away from a record high.\nThe Dow was weighed down by Boeing (BA), which sank 4.79% after a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner carrying 242 peoplecrashed in Indiaon Thursday. At least 290 people are dead, health officials said. The plane hit a hostel for doctors when it crashed.\nThe US dollar broadly weakened on Thursday as investors wrestle with continued tariff uncertainty. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against six major foreign currencies, tumbled 0.72% and fell to its lowest level since 2022.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/12\/business\/us-bond-market","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

The meeting on Monday between representatives from Washington and Beijing comes after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinpingspoke by phoneon Thursday.\nThe S&P 500\u2019s ascent towards a record high comes after ayear of wild swings.

The announcement comes amid a punishing tariff war between the world\u2019s two largest economies as Trump works to rebalance what he considers unfair trade between the US and its global partners. Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping spoke for 90 minutes on Thursday. After Trump\u2019s call with Xi, the US president said he was encouraged that ongoing trade tensions could soon be resolved.\n\u201cWhile there is still uncertainty over tariffs, the stock market is forward looking and has been pricing in an eventual thawing of trade fears,\u201d said Glen Smith, CIO at GDS Wealth Management. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear that the rhetoric on tariffs is much tougher than the action.\u201d\nStock futures had jumped higher on Friday after a slightly better-than-expected jobs report soothed nerves about how the US economy has been holding up during the early stages of Trump\u2019s tariff regime.\nData from the Labor Department showed the economyadded 139,000 jobslast month, which was a slowdown from the month prior but better than anticipated.\nWall Street has been looking for any sign of relief that the economy might be muddling through the uncertainty stoked by Trump\u2019s tariffs.

Yet 100 days into Trump\u2019s second term, Wall Street has been shaken by historic levels of uncertainty and volatility because of tariffs.\n\u201cGiven the ongoing uncertainty around US trade policy and the economic outlook more broadly, we suspect the going will get tougher from here,\u201d said Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics, in a Monday note.\nThe stock market has rallied in recent days, with the S&P 500 and Dow posting a six-day winning streak. The Dow on Tuesday closed higher by 300 points or 0.75%. The broader S&P 500 gained 0.58% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.55%.\nHowever, the S&P 500 is still down 7.27% since Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20. The benchmark index has shed $3.66 trillion in market value since Trump was inaugurated, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nMarkets extended their gains Tuesday afternoon as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on CNBC he had a trade deal done, though he declined to name the country.\nThe S&P 500\u2019s performance so far during Trump\u2019s second term has been the third-worst performance during the first 100 days of any presidential term in US history, following only President Richard Nixon and Ford.\n\u201cPolicy is overshadowing key fundamentals,\u201d said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management Group. \u201cWe could still have some weakness in front of us, but at a minimum, we\u2019ve got volatility until visibility around tariffs starts to improve.\u201d\nThe stock market has been on a rollercoaster this year, whipsawing at the whims of Trump\u2019s back-and-forth decisions on tariff policy.\nThe S&P 500 hit a record high in February before sliding intocorrectionin March as Trump began to roll out his plan for tariffs. The S&P 500 plummeted in early April after Trump unveiled his so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, hitting its lowest point of the year on April 8, when it was on the cusp of entering a bear market.\nRelated articleHas the stock market hit bottom? History is a guide\nThe market has regained some ground since but the S&P 500 is still down 1.94% from where it was before Trump unveiled his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on April 2.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember a time when a policy was so directly aimed at economic outcomes, where it was received so negatively, universally by the investment community,\u201d said Kelly Bouchillon, senior partner at Sound View Wealth Advisors. \u201cIt\u2019s the most uncertainty I think we\u2019ve seen around corporate earnings and growth in sometime, all self-inflicted by the administration.\u201d\nThe Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which boosted the market torecord highsin 2024, have broadly slumped this year. Apple (AAPL) is down 15.66% this year. Nvidia (NVDA) is down 18.8%. Tesla (TSLA) is down 27.7%.\nAmazon (AMZN) has tumbled 14.6% this year. The e-commerce giant briefly dropped on Tuesday after a report from Punchbowl News that the e-commerce giant would begin listing how much of an item\u2019s price represents the added cost of tariffs. White House press secretary Karoline Leavittcalled the movea \u201chostile and political act.\u201d\nAn Amazon spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that the move \u201cwas never a consideration for the main Amazon site and nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties.\u201d\nRelated articleA \u2018p*ssed\u2019 Trump called Jeff Bezos after learning Amazon considered breaking out a tariff charge\nTrump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to complain, two senior White House officials told CNN. Trump later said it was a \u201cgood call.\u201d\n\u201cJeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,\u201d Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cHe solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.\u201d\nThe best performers in the market this year have been have been tobacco and gold, according to CFRA Research. Newmont Corporation (NEM), a gold mining company, is up 42.3% this year. Phillip Morris (PM), the tobacco giant, is up 41.47%.\nMeanwhile, AI and tech company Palantir (PLTR) has soared 53.48% this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after gaining about 340% in 2024.\nThe Nasdaq, which entered a bear market on April 4, is down 11% since Trump\u2019s inauguration. The Dow is down 6.8% since Trump\u2019s inauguration.\nWhile stocks have been volatile, US Treasuries have emerged as a notable loser in Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office.\nTypically, when investors sell off stocks in times of uncertainty, they park their cash in US Treasuries, seeking the safety of an asset backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.\nYet as stocks declined around the world in early April, investors abruptlysold off US Treasuries, raising questions about how much they value US government bonds as a haven.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note has come down to 4.176% since spiking in early April, but the recent volatility has unnerved investors.\n\u201cThe prospect of foreign investors reducing exposure to US assets amid concerns about the continued predominance of US Treasuries as a safe haven has been at the center of market debate over the last few weeks,\u201d said Vishwanath Tirupattur, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, in a Monday note.\nA decline in the dollar this year has sparked debates on Wall Street about the stability and preeminence of US financial markets.\nThe US dollar index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against six foreign currencies, has tumbled more than 8% this year. The dollar index on April 21 hit its lowest level in three years.\nAfter Trump\u2019s election in November, the dollar pushed higher on expectations for economic growth. The swiftdeclinein the dollar has raised questions about investors\u2019 confidence in the United States. The Euro has gained more than 9% against the dollar this year.\n\u201cThat trend of a weaker currency and money flowing into non-US assets does stand out to me as being maybe something that\u2019s going to be a little bit more persistent going forward,\u201d said Joe Zappia, co-chief investment officer at LVW Advisors.\nSome winners across Trump\u2019s first 100 days have been stocks overseas, which have been buoyed by investors reconsidering their allocations to US assets.\nUS markets this year have underperformed markets in Europe, South America and Asia, and the theme of selling American assets has recently captivated some global investors and analysts on Wall Street.\nRelated articleFaced with big US changes, should investors look abroad?\nBank of America\u2019s latest global fund manager survey showed the largest number of global investors on record intending todecrease holdingsof US stocks.\nGermany\u2019s DAX index is up 12.6% this year. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index is up 9.7%this year.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s trade policy has raised concerns about US economic growth and caused global investors to rethink their exposure to the US, Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management,told CNN.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a European investor, you will now think twice about allocating strategically to the US,\u201d Sai said. \u201cThe S&P 500 is no longer the only game in town.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s trade policy has injected historic levels of volatility into the stock market.\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, spiked sharply this year, hitting levels not seen since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe VIX closed at 52 points on April 8. The VIX has only closed above 50 twice before this month: in March 2020 and during the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe VIX has declined in recent weeks but is still trading above 20 points, the level associated with heightened volatility.\nGold has emerged as the champion of Trump\u2019s first 100 days.\nThe yellow metal has soared about 26% this year, smashing through record highs and briefly surpassing $3,500 a troy ounce.\nInvestors have flocked to gold as a safe haven given the uncertain outlook of Trump\u2019s tariffs and the US-China trade war. Bullion is historically a haven during times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty.\nThe most crowded trade in April was gold, according to the Bank of America survey, breaking a two-year streak for the Magnificent Seven tech stocks.\nCNN\u2019s Betsy Klein and Alayna Treene contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/29\/investing\/us-stock-market","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump wants to play market hero. But the economic damage is done","date":"2025-04-09","body":"A version of this story appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\n\u201cI guess they say it was the biggest day in financial history,\u201d President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon. Later, in an apparent hot-mic moment, he told a fawning senator that the market was up almost seven percentage points. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever heard of it. It\u2019s gonna be a record.\u201d\nIt was a historic day, indeed \u2014the third \u201cbest\u201d day in the S&P 500\u2019s history. After Trump announced that he was institutinga 90-day pauseon most new tariffs (minus China), the Dow added 2,900 points, or nearly 8%. The S&P 500 soared almost 9.5%, its best day since 2008, and the Nasdaq had its second-best day ever, rising more than 12%.\nAnd it was all thanks to Trump \u2014 the guy whose extreme agenda (and contradictory messaging around it) became a noose around the neck of global financial markets that were about to enter a doom spiral.\nWall Street\u2019s reaction to his reversal on tariffs is not a victory lap for investors \u2014 it\u2019s a gasp for oxygen. Asset prices remain well below where they were a week ago, before Trump announced the tariffs.\nThe past week cost US stocks $6 trillion in value as market participants prepared for a wildly uncertain future, all while knowing the president is prone to pulling the rug out from under their feet.\nTrump is clearly loving the sea of green on the TV stock ticker. But it\u2019s going to take a lot more than one day of stock gains to undo the damage \u2014 to the economy and to America\u2019s reputation \u2014 that his policies have done.\n\u201cMy sense here is that the (US) economy is still likely to fall into recession, given the level of simultaneous shocks that it\u2019s absorbed,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist of consulting firm RSM,told CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace. \u201cAll this does is postpone temporarily what will likely be a series of punitive import taxes put on US trade allies.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s new plan is hardly a full retreat. It leaves in place some of his historic and most aggressive tariffs in place, including 10% tariffs on all virtually all imports coming into the United States and ratchets up tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%. Still in place are 25% tariffs on some goods from Mexico and Canada and 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\nOver the next three months, the White House expects dozens of governments to try to come to the negotiating table to hammer out longer-term deals \u2014 a process that would overwhelm even the most disciplined White House, given the complexity that such trade agreements typically require.\nPrior to Trump\u2019s tariff pause, RSM raised its recession odds to 55% from 20%. Brusuelas said the recession is likely to occur in next few months.\nThat\u2019s because businesses have already felt the supply shock and are raising prices in accordance with the White House\u2019s promise.\n\u201cBased on anecdotal discussions I\u2019ve had with clients\u2026 many of them are going to choose just to leave the products at the docks \u2014 they don\u2019t have the cash reserves to pay the tax,\u201d Brusuelas said.\nA chorus of economists and analysts were similarly keeping the champagne on ice.\n\u201cEven if the administration decides to de-escalate global trade wars and shift their focus to other policy areas, we\u2019re still not out of the woods,\u201d wrote Christian Hoffman, head of fixed income at Thornburg Investment Management, in an email. \u201cUncertainty remains exceptionally high, and our attention will move away from the president\u2019s tweets and back to economic data to assess the damage that\u2019s been done.\u201d\nTech investor Dan Ives said Trump\u2019s announcement was the news \u201ceveryone on the Street was waiting for.\u201d But he called the trade war with China \u201can epic debacle\u201d that has already done real damage to the economy.\nGoldman Sachs economists said the chances of a recession, while slightly lower after Wednesday\u2019s shift, are still elevated, at around 45%. Basically a coin flip.\nOne of the yarns the White House has been spinning lately is that Trump won\u2019t be moved by the stock market \u2014 that the tariff policy was too important to rehabbing America\u2019s economy.\nBut clearly, Trump\u2019s longtime fixation on the market as a barometer of his presidency hasn\u2019t gone away.\nOn Monday, as stocks were tumbling,a mysterious, apparently misfired tweetabout a 90-day tariff relief plan briefly turned the market around in a wild jolt. The rally only lasted a few minutes, as the White House dismissed the rumor, which ended up on a CNBC chyron, as \u201cfake news.\u201d\nBut the blip offered a glimpse at what would happen ifTrump did decide to put some slack into the noose, giving corporations, government leaders and investors a moment to catch their breath and make a plan.\nSure enough, as the market opened Wednesday morning, Trump posted on Truth Social that \u201cTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!\u201d A few hours later, his tariff plans were on hold and markets immediately turned positive.\nThe president told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny that he decided to institute the 90-day pause because he thought \u201cpeople were jumping a little bit out of line \u2014 they were getting yippy.\u201d\n\u201cI was watching the bond market,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\nOf all the financial warning signs plaguing traders over the past week, the bond market\u2019s behavior was by far the scariest.\nIn normal times, stocks and bonds don\u2019t fall simultaneously. When investors are nervous, they tend to put their money into safe havens like US Treasury bonds, which causes bond prices to go up.\nThat has not been happening. Instead, investors around the world have been offloading stocks and bonds at the same time, causing stock prices to fall and bond yields (which move inversely to prices) to shoot higher.\nThat\u2019s a huge red flag, for a variety of reasons. It could mean investors are questioning the US government\u2019s long-term stability. It could also mean investors who lost a ton of money in the market are under pressure to shore up cash to cover their positions. Or it could be a sign that of what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a former hedge funder, called \u201cdeleveraging convulsions\u201d \u2014 essentially, an unwinding of a popular arbitrage strategy known as a \u201cbasis trade\u201d that relies on usingloadsof borrowed money to buy Treasury bonds.\nWhatever the cause, this bond market distress signal has only gone off a handful of times in history \u2014 the most recent being 2020 and 2008. (Remember what happened then?)\n\u201cThe bond market spooked the president,\u201d Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN\u2019s Matt Egan. \u201cBond vigilantes were screaming that they weren\u2019t happy with what was going on and there was a potential for a recession.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/09\/business\/trump-stocks-bond-market-nightcap","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Wall Street closes out a wild month on a subdued note","date":"2025-08-29","body":"Tech stocks dragged the market lower on Friday and Wall Street wrapped up a wild summer on a relatively quiet note.\nThe Dow fell 92 points, or 0.2%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.64%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.15%.\nDespite the dip, the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closed August with healthy gains of 3.2%, 1.91% and 1.58%, respectively.\nThe Dow and S&P 500 have posted four months of gains in a row, which is their best streak in roughly one year. The Nasdaq posted five months of gains in a row, its best streak since early 2024.\nStocks have rallied in recent months as trade tensions have settled, corporate earnings have come in better than expected and traders have ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.\nYet slowing momentum in the artificial intelligence trade has weighed on markets. Dell (DELL) and Marvell Technology (MRVL), a semiconductor company, on Friday fell 8.9% and 18.6%, respectively, after reporting earnings that did not impress Wall Street.\nNvidia (NVDA), the core of the AI trade, sank 3.36%. Nvidia posted its first losing month since March.\n\u201cExpectations for tech are sky high,\u201d Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, said. \u201cThe companies have done well, but not necessarily well enough to get them to move to the next level.\u201d\nAI and tech stocks slide as summer rally peters out\n\u201cEarnings were strong, but AI-related growth outlooks showed deceleration,\u201d analysts at Citi said in a note. \u201cAll in, stocks have not broken but have clearly lost some momentum. To be fair, the breakneck pace of gains off April lows couldn\u2019t continue forever.\u201d\nWall Street on Friday also digested the latest batch of inflation data. Stock had opened lower as data showed thePersonal Consumption Expendituresindex rose 2.6% year-over-year in July, in line with expectations.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 a core measure of PCE that strips out volatile food and energy prices \u2014 rose 2.9% year-over-year in July. It\u2019s the hottest annual pace since February but was also in line with expectations.\n\u201cInflation is increasing ever so slightly, but right in line with forecasts,\u201d Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.\nAmericans kept spending last month despite elevated inflation\nUS stocks ended August on a subdued note, with relatively light trading volume ahead of the Labor Day weekend. But it\u2019s been another wild month for markets.\nTraders have braced a barrage of headlines, from a weaker-than-expectedjobs report, to the implementation of President Donald Trump\u2019swidespread tariffs, to his administration\u2019s attempts to oust Federal Reserve GovernorLisa Cook.\nAnd, through it all, stocks have continued to steadily rise, buoyed by hopes for Fed rate cuts, stronger-than-expected corporate earnings and slowing but stubborn confidence that an AI boom might reap big rewards for investors.\nAbout 98% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported second-quarter earnings, with 81% of those companies beating Wall Street\u2019s earnings expectations, according to FactSet data.\n\u201cThe US stock market is at an all-time high, thanks in part to rapid earnings growth and expectations for that to continue,\u201d James Reilly, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell delivered remarks at a central banking forum in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last week thathinted potential rate cutscould be on the horizon.\nWhile Powell\u2019s remarks signaled concerns about a slowing labor market, investors and traders have been ecstatic about the potential for lower borrowing costs.\nThe Russell 2000, an index of smaller companies that are more sensitive to interest rates, soared 7% this month as investors adjusted to the prospect of rate cuts as soon as September. It was the index\u2019s best month since November.\n\u201cHistory shows that\u2019s the most sensitive place to getting a little bit of a boost if the Fed cuts,\u201d said Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares.\nMeanwhile, Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, is trading near its lowest levels of the year, signaling relative calm and confidence in markets.\nThe S&P 500 on Thursday closed above 6,500 points for the first time ever. It was the benchmark index\u2019s 20th record high this year.\nSince World War II, whenever the S&P has notched 20 or more all-time highs by the end of August, the index was higher by the end of the year about 90% of the time, with an average gain of 5.5%, according to Sam Stovall, chief market strategist at CFRA Research.\nStocks\u2019 ascent to fresh records come as the Trump administration ramps up its assault on the Fed. While uncertainty lingers about the the administration\u2019s feud with Cook, it\u2019s being deliberated by the courts and investors are awaiting more clarity about what might happen.\n\u201cThe market is waiting and seeing how far this will go,\u201d Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management Group, said.\nTrump official lodges new criminal referral against Fed Governor Lisa Cook\n\u201cWe believe the subdued market response is a nod towards a potentially extended legal battle,\u201d Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in a note. \u201cNevertheless, the dispute likely signals the potential for larger financial market movements to come.\u201d\nGold, a haven during uncertainty, jumped roughly 1.2% on Friday. The yellow metal rose 5% this month and notched its best month since April.\nGold is also considered a hedge against inflation and can rise when investors expect the Fed to lower interest rates.\n\u201cWith policy now the key driver, gold remains well supported heading into September,\u201d said Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council.\nWhile stocks have floated near record highs, September could be a difficult month, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. Across the past 75 years, the S&P 500 has notched an average decline of 0.7% in September, \u201cmaking it the worst performing month for stocks,\u201d Turnquist said.\nScott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he\u2019ll be looking to buy more stocks if there is a dip.\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably overdue for a pullback now, and I think that if we do get some sort of a pullback here, we\u2019ll be looking to lean more into stocks,\u201d Wren said. \u201cWe\u2019re actually hoping that we get an opportunity to pick up some equities at lower prices.\u201d\nIt will be another month jam-packed with economic data. Trading for the month will begin on Tuesday as markets are closed for Labor Day on September 1.\nWall Street will be watching jobs data for August, set to be released on September 5, in addition to Consumer Price Index data for August due on September 11.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/08\/29\/economy\/us-stock-market","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"The stock market is on a hot streak. It\u2019s about to face a huge test","date":"2025-07-23","body":"Six months into President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, a quick glance at the stock market offers a reassuring picture: The S&P 500 just closed above 6,300 points for the first time ever and has notched eight record highs in the past month.\nIf you look at markets halfway into the year, it might not be apparent that there has been unprecedentedtrade turmoil, conflict in theMiddle Eastand relentless attacks on the Federal Reserve\u2019sindependence.\nThe stock market andbitcoinhave soared to record highs, while bonds have resumed asteady rallyand volatility inoil priceshas subsided. Global markets so far this year have been remarkably resilient.\nThe calm mood on Wall Street is an extraordinary change from early April, when the S&P 500 hit its lowest level in over a year and was on theprecipice of a bear marketafter Trump unveiled his initial \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs.\n\u201cPerhaps the move by US stocks off the early-April lows is emblematic of the age-old adage about bull markets often climbing a \u2018wall of worry,\u2019\u201d Liz Ann Sonders and Kevin Gordon, investment strategists at Charles Schwab, said in a note. \u201cThere is no shortage of things to worry about; but that\u2019s the wall markets often climb.\u201d\nMarkets are floating near record highs despite underlying tariff uncertainty. While investors have begun to shrug off a myriad of concerns, US stocks are trading at historically expensive valuations as Trump\u2019s self-imposed August 1tariff deadlineapproaches. As Trump presses forward with his trade war, markets\u2019 momentum will face a tariff test.\n\u201cWhat has held stocks aloft \u2026 is the premise that whatever tariff increases come on August 1, they will not be permanent,\u201d Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group, said in a note.\n\u201cThe prospect that \u2018deals\u2019 will be struck thereafter remains a factor, we believe, in keeping traders from selling stocks more aggressively,\u201d Wizman said.\nJeff Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist, strategists at LPL Financial, said in a note that the S&P 500\u2019s \u201cunusually sharp and swift \u2018V-shaped recovery\u2019\u201d from its low point in early April was \u201cone of the most powerful post-correction rebounds in stock market history.\u201d\nThe ferocity of the market\u2019s recovery has raised questions about whether it is supported by fundamentals \u2014 or if underlying weakness could arise.\nWhile the market experienced bouts of enormous volatility in recent months, stocks continue to push higher. The S&P 500 is up 5.2% since Trump took office.\nTrump has acknowledged the market\u2019s rebound. The presidentearlier this monthtold NBC News that \u201ctariffs have been very well received,\u201d noting that the \u201cstock market hit a new high.\u201d\nThe \u201csoftening\u201d of initial tariff announcements has \u201cremoved the worst-case scenarios\u201d for outlooks for economic growth and inflation, investors at BlackRock said in a note, which has supported the market\u2019s rally.\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers trading platform, told CNN that the rally has also been driven by momentum and a fear of missing out.\n\u201cEver since the president\u2019s about-face in early April that turned the market around, a lot of money has been made basically by investors assuming that these tariffs will be postponed, renegotiated or otherwise watered down,\u201d Sosnick said. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s a trade that works very well for people over a long period of time, they\u2019re going to keep doing it.\u201d\nMeanwhile, bitcoin last week surged to a record high above $123,000 as Republicans in Congress pressed forward withlandmark legislationto regulate cryptocurrencies.\nEconomists at the consultancy Capital Economics said in a note that they think the \u201cUS economy will weather the global trade war,\u201d enabling the S&P 500 to rise further. However, they said, Trump\u2019s \u201cunpredictable approach\u201d to trade and attacks on the Fed\u2019s independence could \u201ctrigger\u201d a downturn in stocks.\n\u201cThe widespread assumption among market participants still appears to be that the president will not follow through on threats to raise tariffs much further and that Chair Powell will remain in place, but that may prove too optimistic,\u201d they said.\nThe S&P 500 has not posted a gain or loss of more than 1% since June 24. It\u2019s a sign that momentum has slowed down. Bitcoin traded around $119,000 as of Tuesday.\nMegan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors, said she thinks markets might be complacent about potential risks, given stocks are historically expensive.\nWhile stocks and bonds have emerged relatively unscathed, one outlier is the US dollar, which has continued a precipitousdecline. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against six major foreign currencies, is down almost 11% since Trump took office.\nGold and silver, meanwhile, have continued to serve as hedges against Trump\u2019s trade uncertainty. The yellow and silver precious metals have soared 30% and 35% this year, respectively.\nThe rally in recent months has been driven byretail investors, or individuals buying their own stocks, as opposed to Wall Street institutions, according to Venu Krishna, an equity strategist at Barclays.\n\u201cRe-risking by institutional money remains muted, making it likely that retail investors were at the helm for the latest leg of the rally,\u201d Krishna said. He estimates retail investors poured more than $50 billion into global stocks across the past month.\nInvestors who bought the dip when markets dropped in April have been rewarded with an extraordinary march to fresh highs. The S&P 500 has gained almost 27% since its low point in April.

The S&P 500 posted its third-worst100-day startto a presidential term in US history, only behind Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon.\nThe S&P 500 initiallysurgedafter Trump\u2019s reelection in November on expectations for a pro-business boom. Yet as the president unveiled his plan for tariffs and has gone back and forth on trade policy, Wall Street has beenshakenby historic levels of uncertainty and volatility.\nCNN is tracking the S&P 500\u2019s performance each day across Trump\u2019s second term to see how it compares to past presidents since World War II.\nAs the benchmark US stock index, the S&P 500 tracks the 500 biggest public companies in the United States by market value. Even if you don\u2019t own individual stocks, retirement plans like 401(k)s are invested funds that track the S&P 500, meaning you might be invested in these top companies through your employer.\nAbout 62% of US adults held stocks in 2024, whether through an individual stock, a mutual fund or a retirement savings account, according to an annual Gallupsurvey.\nSince the end of World War II, the S&P returned an average of 2.1% during a president\u2019s first 100 days, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\nAn above-average return for the S&P during a president\u2019s first 100 days corresponded with an average gain that year of 21.1%.

The same goes if you had some exposure to non-US equities, which have outperformed domestic stocks this year, even though they, too, got hit in the past week.\nSure, \u201closing less\u201d hardly feels like \u201cwinning.\u201d And your pile is still smaller \u2013 at least on paper for now.\nRelated articleWant greater financial peace of mind amid the current uncertainty and chaos? Consider doing these 4 things\nBut losing less than you might have should provide a little comfort since the stock market will go through bear markets and near-bear markets many times in every investor\u2019s life. Having adiversified portfoliowill almost always reduce your portfolio\u2019s risk and volatility.\n\u201cThis is a great time for younger people to learn a lesson for the next four to five decades. These market moves have happened before and will happen again. It\u2019s what markets do,\u201d said Brian Kearns, a certified financial planner and registered investment advisor.\nIn the near term, markets will remain on a knife\u2019s edge, with stocks likely tobounce backat times on any perceived good news or traders\u2019 sense that stocks may have been oversold. On Monday morning, for instance, stocks quickly butbriefly gained groundafter someone posted, falsely, that Trump would consider a 90-day pause in tariffs.\nSo, what to do now? Here is some perspective and advice from financial experts.\nMainstream economists, investorsandCEOsare having a hard time making economic sense of what Trump is doing with his punitive tariffs. That\u2019s why there\u2019s no guarantee as to how they will affect stocks in the long run.\nBut the going assumption is that stocks, as they have over the past century, will eventually bounce back.\nOver the long run, they have provided solid returns for investors that far outpaced inflation.\nSo do a diversified mix of investments. Take the 60\/40 portfolio \u2013 with 60% in stocks and 40% in fixed-income assets like government and corporate bonds. Typically, when stocks do poorly, bonds do better.\nEven though the 60\/40 portfolio has had some bad single-year performances \u2013 it got hammered in 2022, for example \u2013 over time, it has offered a lot of ballast for investors.\nFrom 1901 through 2022, the median return of a US-based 60\/40 portfolio was 6.4%, and when measured over 10-year rolling periods, it was 5.81%, according to a study from the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute.\n\u201cThe long-term stability of the 60\/40 portfolio in the United States has been noteworthy, mainly because of the market\u2019s strong resilience and recovery after significant downturns,\u201d the authors wrote.\nIf you\u2019re ever tempted to cash out of equities when stocks are going haywire, know that such a move can be risky for two reasons.\nFirst, selling when stocks are low locks in your losses. Since timing the market is impossible, you may re-enter after a recovery begins, potentially repurchasing what you used to own at a higher price.\nSecond, you may get too comfortable keeping the cash. Not only will it not grow nearly as much as equities in the long run, but you risk losing spending power if inflation increases, which is expected to happen under Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nEven if you can get a nominal rate of return that matches or outpaces inflation \u2013 say on a certificate of deposit \u2013 the tax you owe on the interest may erase that advantage.\n\u201cWhat is cash doing for you? Is there inflation? Absolutely. So what is your after-tax rate of return?\u201d said CFP Frank Wong, a principal at W Wealth Strategies.\nBig stock declines can provide long-term buying opportunities. \u201cIf you went to the supermarket (last month) and tuna was $3 for two cans and now it\u2019s $3 for 4 cans, what do you do? You buy more cans,\u201d Wong said.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean you should do so indiscriminately when buying into stock indexes. \u201cWade in, don\u2019t dive,\u201d Kearns advised, noting that before the latest rout, stocks have been overvalued relative to the risk investors took to own them. Target-date funds in your 401(k) \u2013 which invest with an eye toward the year you are likely to retire \u2013 should do this kind of risk management for you.\nMost people under 50 have a long time before retirement, allowing them to invest more heavily in stocks. However, many people over 50 also have a long horizon during which to invest \u2014 potentially 15 to 30 years. That is because the majority of their savings will remain invested throughout much of their retirement, as they typically withdraw only small amounts annually to supplement income from Social Security and any pensions.\nThat said, for money you will need within the next five years, be very conservative, Wong advised. \u201cWhatever you have now, I\u2019d hold.\u201d Ideally, you\u2019d keep that money in short-term fixed income and high-yield savings so that it earns at least enough to keep pace with inflation.\nRetirees and those within a few years of retirement should avoid selling any of their stock holdings when the market is down. Instead, you will want to have up to two years of cash to cover your living expenses on top of any fixed income payments you\u2019ll get.\nRelated articleMarket losses early in retirement can increase your risk of outliving your money. But you can take steps to mitigate that\nIf you have to tap your current portfolio to raise that cash right now, \u201cpull from assets that haven\u2019t fallen a lot during this period \u2013 for example, high-quality bonds,\u201d said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar.\nIf you\u2019re still working, she said, try to boost your savings. If you\u2019re over 50, you\u2019re entitled to makecatch-up contributionsin your 401(k). And those catch-up contribution limits are even higher if you\u2019re in your early 60s.\nLastly, do a \u201cbudget audit\u201d to see where you can reduce your spending, Benz recommends.\n\u201cIn addition to boosting savings and building out your cash buckets, that strategy has an emotional \u2018take control\u2019 benefit. Having a tighter budget will help reduce portfolio withdrawals once retirement commences,\u201d Benz said.\nFor retirees who are no longer saving, she also advises trying to adjust spending during market downturns. \u201cThat will leave more of their portfolios in place to recover when the market eventually does,\u201d she noted.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/08\/business\/what-to-do-stock-market-drop","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

The broader S&P 500 fell 1.97% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.7%. The slide on Friday put all three major indexes in the red for this week.\nThe S&P 500 is down more than 5% this year. The benchmark index is on track for its first losing quarter since September 2023 and its worst quarter since September 2022.\nUS stocks opened the day lower and began to slide as data from the Commerce Department showed inflation in February remained slightly sticky.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures index rose 2.5% year-over-year in February, unchanged from January and matching expectations. Yet the core PCE index, which strips out volatile categories like food and energy, ticked up to 2.8% year-over-year from 2.7% in January. That hotter-than-expected rise signals that inflation, while broadly cooling, remains above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\nMeanwhile, consumer sentimenttanked12% this month, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s latest survey released Friday.\nThe selloff gradually turned into a rout as investors dumped stocks in industries including technology, autos and airlines. Google (GOOG) slid 4.9%, Stellantis (STLA) slid 4% and Delta Air Lines (DAL) slid 5%.\nLululemon (LULU) stock tumbled 14% on Friday after the company flagged concerns about the outlook for consumer spending on a call with investors.\n\u201cWe also believe the dynamic macro environment has contributed to a more cautious consumer,\u201d said Calvin McDonald, chief executive at Lululemon.\nThe selloff in major names wasn\u2019t the only concern for investors. CoreWeave (CRWV), an AI venture backed by chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), had a disappointing debut on the Nasdaq Friday, offering a bleak outlook for both the prospects of a continued AI boom and the market for initial public offerings.\nCoreWeave had listed its IPO at $40, which was below its target range of $47 to $55, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, the stock began trading on Friday at $39, below that IPO price.\nThe poor debut is a sign of cooling enthusiasm for AI as investors continue to debate whether the money being poured into the industry is worth it. It also offers a meager outlook for IPOs this year as markets struggle to look past headwinds from tariffs.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s tariff proposals have also clouded investor sentiment and stoked uncertainty on Wall Street.\nInvestors continued to grapple with Trump\u2019s announcement on Wednesday of 25% tariffs on all cars shipped into the US, set to go into effect April 3. Trump also announced tariffs on car parts like engines and transmissions, set to take effect \u201cno later than May 3,\u201d according to the proclamation he signed.\nInvestors sold off stocks amid renewed anxiety about the impact of auto tariffs on the economy. Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and economists expect Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff proposals will cause an increase in consumer prices and drag on economic growth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural for people to expect higher prices because we haven\u2019t seen a trade war like this sinceMcKinley,\u201d Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B.

The early announcement highlights Trump\u2019s commitment to tariffs, testing some investors\u2019 initial hope that they might only be a negotiating tactic.\n\u201cWe think the proposed tariffs as announced would deliver a big hit to the auto industry, stoking higher costs, higher prices and a sharp decline in US sales,\u201d said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note Thursday.\n\u201c[The] question is what these very aggressive automotive tariffs signal for next week\u2019s announcement on both reciprocal and ex-auto sector tariffs,\u201d Marcelli added.\nWall Street\u2019s expectations for US stocks this year are being revised down amid continued announcements about tariffs.\nAnalysts at UBS on Friday trimmed their year-end target for the S&P 500 to 6,400 from 6,600.\nAnalysts at Barclays this week lowered their year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,900 from 6,600.

{"title":"How to invest when stocks are volatile","date":"2025-03-18","body":"March has been a dizzying month for US markets. The S&P 500 just posted two days of back-to-back gains, but the benchmark index is still down almost 5% this month.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcements have roiled markets and sent US stocks bouncing all over the place. While the uncertainty on Wall Street can be unsettling, selling your stocks in panic would likely only make it worse.\nAlthough recent market swings can be daunting, market volatility is more normal than you\u2019d think, according to Jeff Buchbinder, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.\n\u201cVolatility is like a toll investors pay on the road to attractive long-term returns,\u201d Buchbinder said in a recent note.\nThe last thing you want to do is\u201cpanic sell.\u201d Volatility is a short-term feature of markets.So, too, are so-called corrections, when stocks fall 10% from their most recent high.\nHistorically, the US stock market has climbed higher in the long term, smoothing out kinks and rewarding investors who stayed in the market.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday told NBC News that he was \u201cnot at all\u201d worried about recent drops in the stock market.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cThey\u2019re normal. What\u2019s not healthy is straight up.\u201d\nStill, seeing your retirement account take a hit can be unnerving, especially given the whiplash of recent market swings. But if you\u2019re investing for retirement or long-term financial goals, the best thing to do during moments of uncertainty is to keep calm and tune out the noise.\nRelated articleWall Street is turning its back on Trump and flashing an economic warning\n\u201cReacting emotionally to the markets can wreck your returns,\u201d said Jon Ulin, a certified financial planner and chief executive at Ulin & Co. Wealth Management.\n\u201cPanic selling often means locking in losses and missing the best rebound days,\u201d Ulin said.\nA core tenet of investing is that no one can really \u201ctime\u201d the market. Swings can be so unpredictable that staying invested is a better strategy than selling and trying to pick the best opportunity to get back into a fund or stock you sold. People who sell when times are tough tend to lose out in the long run.\n\u201cProtecting your portfolio isn\u2019t about timing the market \u2014 it\u2019s about time in the market with a strategy that can withstand the storm,\u201d Ulin said.\nIf you\u2019ve checked your retirement account and felt unsettled \u2014 you\u2019re likely not alone.\nThe S&P 500\u2019s performance from Trump\u2019s inauguration to March 7, or 46 days into his second term, was the index\u2019s worst start to a presidency since President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\nTrump\u2019s whipsawing tariff proposals are the primary reason for the markets\u2019 rollercoaster ride, because they have created an environment of uncertainty. US stocks have slid amid the ensuing economic chaos, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite largely erasing their gains since the election.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 last week closed down 10% from its record high reached on February 19, its first correction since October 2023.\nNonetheless, it\u2019s important to recognize that market downturns are normal occurrences. The S&P 500 on average has three drops between 5% and 10% each year, according to Buchbinder.\nStocks on average see one correction a year, according to Buchbinder. Before the S&P 500 closed in correction territory last week, it had been over a year since its last correction. If you\u2019re planning to hold your investments long term, such drops in one year don\u2019t necessarily matter.\nHeading into this year, US stocks had been at record highs, with some strategists questioning whether they were overvalued. The S&P 500 postedback-to-back gainsof more than 20% in 2023 and 2024 \u2014 a feat not achieved since President Bill Clinton was in office in the 1990s.\nAfter those sky-high gains, investors were already uncertain whether the good times would last. Big tech stocks that propped up the S&P 500 in 2024 have sputtered this year. While downturns are frustrating, they also present opportunities to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d and purchase stocks while they are cheaper.\n\u201cEncouragingly, history hints (but does not guarantee) that quick drops below the 10% decline threshold typically resulted in shorter and shallower total declines, followed by more rapid recoveries,\u201d Stovall said in a note Monday.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the greatest uncertainty surrounding this decline and possible recovery is that its major headwind \u2014 the tariff tiff \u2014 appears far from over,\u201d Stovall added.\nWhile markets face continued tariff uncertainty, it can be helpful to return to investing 101.\nA portfolio that is well-diversified across different types of stocks and bonds can help you mitigate losses during market swings. That becomes especially apparent during times of heightened volatility.\n\u201cSpreading risk across different asset classes, sectors and regions is investing 101,\u201d Ulin said. \u201cThink of diversification as your portfolio\u2019s seatbelt, keeping you secure when markets hit rough air.\u201d\nIf your portfolio is overexposed to US stocks, it might be smart to consider buying stocks in global markets like Europe and to further diversify by investing in Treasury bonds. Diversification might also look like investing in stocks in industries that have less exposure to tariffs, or \u201ctariff-proofing\u201d your portfolio, Ulin said.\nAs with all things in investing, there is no one-size-fits-all. Each person has their own unique financial goals and tolerance for risk.\nRelated articleMarket losses early in retirement can increase your risk of outliving your money. But you can take steps to mitigate that\nPeriods of volatility present opportunities to reflect on whether or not your investments still align with your financial goals, according to Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management.\nThat means reviewing your investing goals and reassessing whether you\u2019re well situated to pay for big-ticket items you might have coming up, whether you have enough cash for emergencies and whether there are new opportunities to buy stocks given the recent declines. If you are closer to retirement, you might consider parking more cash in Treasury bills or other cash-equivalent assets, as one of the most essential steps to take is to try and minimizesequence risk.\nThe bottom line: Volatility \u2014 though unnerving \u2014 is normal. Keep a level head and look for opportunities to diversify and bolster your portfolio.\n\u201cRegularly review your asset allocation, rebalance when needed and tune out the noise,\u201d Ulin said. \u201cLong-term success is built on discipline, not panic.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/18\/investing\/investing-stocks-volatile-tariffs-retirement","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Trump heads to Pennsylvania as GOP tries to sell its own affordability message","date":"2025-12-09","body":"President Donald Trumpwill take his economic message on the road Tuesday to a swing district in eastern Pennsylvania, the first of many planned domestic trips the White House is organizing on an issue it believes will be the key decider in next year\u2019s midterms.\n\u201cAffordability\u201d has become a buzzword among leaders in both parties in recent months, with each side trying to win the messaging war and deflect blame over the financial strain felt by millions of Americans.\nFor Trump, who promised a new age of economic prosperity in his campaign, it\u2019s a test of his ability to deliver, as GOP lawmakers prepare for an uphill battle defending their House and Senate majorities.\n\u201cEverybody gets it at the White House,\u201d said one Trump adviser. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to go, and it\u2019s frustrating for the president, but it\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to deal with.\u201d\nYet more than a year after his victory, polls show that a majority of Americans feel Trump has not yet made good on that promise \u2014 and he faces the prospect of an electoral wipeout in next year\u2019s midterms if he fails to quickly regain his footing on the economy.And so far, the president has struggled to stay on message when it comes to the economy and has even dismissed Americans\u2019 economic pain, repeatedly referring to affordability as a \u201cDemocratic hoax\u201d in the wake of theparty\u2019s electoral successesin off-year elections last month.\nA recent Gallup poll found that 40% of Americans rated economic conditions as poor in November, up from 37% in October.\nAFox News national surveyfrom November found 76% of voters view the economy negatively. And perhaps most alarming for Trump and his aides, Republicans have steadily lost their long-held advantage over Democrats on economic issues, with the administration bleeding support from cost-concerned voters on both sides of the aisle.\n\u201cLarge numbers, overall and among Republicans, say their costs for groceries, utilities, healthcare and housing have gone up this year,\u201d Fox News said of the results.\nA key question hanging over Tuesday\u2019s event \u2014 and the White House\u2019s economic strategy \u2014 is how Trump himself chooses to approach the cost-of-living issue during his speech at the Mount Airy Casino Resort: Will he continue to insist on painting the economy as being stronger than ever thanks to his leadership, or will he concede to his aides\u2019 wishes and acknowledge there is work to be done to help ease Americans\u2019 concerns?\nAlarm bells began going off on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue after Democrats walked away with major victories in New Jersey, Virginia and California last month, with high prices and cost-of-living concerns ranking as a top issue for voters, multiple White House and Trump administration officials told CNN.\nSince then, Trump has been focused on highlighting his economic policies and has called on members of his party to do the same, though he personally views the issue as a perception problem, the officials said.\n\u201cHe feels this is a communication issue,\u201d said one administration official. \u201cHe wants Republicans to step it up in talking about all the good work being done to improve the economy.\u201d\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, one of a handful of Republicans who\u2019s defending a district Trump lost in 2024, said he agrees with the president that affordability \u201cistheissue.\u201d\n\u201cThat trumps everything else,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Manu Rajuin a recent interview, adding that he doesn\u2019t think his party has been focusing enough on the topic.\nHowever, Fitzpatrick also said he disagrees with the president\u2019s rhetoric referring to affordability as \u201ca Democratic scam.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that to be true at all. And we know it\u2019s real,\u201d he said. \u201cI \u2014 believe me \u2014 I hear it every day back home. It\u2019s real.\u201d\nTrump has bristled at the suggestion there are fundamental flaws in the economy, which he frequently boasts he rescued from Biden-era policies, flashing irritation in particular at Democrats\u2019 efforts to seize on affordability issues as a central element of their midterm strategy.\nIn public and private, Trump has instead cast blame on former President Joe Biden, arguing he inherited a plagued economy and that it takes time for his own policies to settle in. He\u2019s resisted acknowledging voters\u2019 cost-of-living concerns as legitimate, deriding affordability worries as a \u201choax\u201d and \u201ccon job\u201d ginned up solely to hurt him politically.\nIn a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai characterized the cost-of-living concerns as \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s inflation and affordability crisis,\u201d arguing that Trump views improving the economy as a top priority.\n\u201cMuch work remains, but President Trump is highlighting the meaningful progress that his Administration has made and will continue to make,\u201d he said.\nBut as Trump approaches the one-year mark of his second term, simply blaming Biden has begun to lose its effectiveness with the public. And even as Trump publicly downplays Americans\u2019 financial struggles under his tenure, his top advisers acknowledge the GOP has a problem. CNN previously reported that in recent weeks, White House officials have advised the president not to brush away or outright dismiss that Americans are feeling squeezed byrising prices.\nThey have pressed the president to express greater sympathy and adopt a message that contrasts his agenda with congressional Democrats\u2019, rather than with an ex-president who has little remaining sway even within his own party.\n\u201cJoe Biden is no longer a threat to them because he\u2019s out of office, he\u2019s never going to be in office again,\u201d the Trump adviser said, arguing that the president needs instead to focus on selling his policies and reassuring voters that more help is on the way. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel their pain. You\u2019ve got to talk about it every day.\u201d\nAs part of that push, Trump\u2019s advisers have been actively putting \u201cpolicy time\u201d \u2014 as one of the officials characterized it \u2014 on the president\u2019s schedule with the goal of accelerating the administration\u2019s efforts to tackle inflation.\nPart of the strategy,first reported by CNN, is aimed at having the president travel the country to better communicate his economic platform, such as with his visit to Mount Pocono on Tuesday.\nStarting early next year, the White House wants to get into a weekly rhythm of having the president take day trips to cities across the country tied to the issue, a senior White House official told CNN.\nTuesday\u2019s event \u2014 in a district Trump carried by nearly 9 points and which GOP Rep. Rob Bresnahan narrowly flipped in 2024 \u2014 will put the president\u2019s messaging to the test.\nDuring a Monday roundtable highlighting the administration\u2019sefforts to aid farmers, Trump indicated he was aware of the need to adopt a stronger message on the economy, insisting several times that he was focused on \u201cfixing the problem.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple statement: They caused it, we\u2019re fixing it,\u201d Trump said of his rebuttal to Democrats\u2019 affordability arguments. \u201cWe inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country, and we\u2019re taking it.\u201d\nInside the White House, officials believe they can still regain ground on the economy, pointing to progress on lowering gas prices and the cost of eggs, as well as tax relief set to take effect next year that they argue will benefit some voters \u2014 even if few of them are aware of it.\nSeveral officials also argue that many of the policies enacted thus far \u2014 such as energy deregulations and other provisions in the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d that passed over the summer \u2014 need time to work their way to Americans\u2019 pockets. It\u2019s a message they\u2019ve also given to Trump during their meetings on tackling the affordability issue, they said.\nAides are also on the hunt for more ways to demonstrate that they\u2019re focused on cost-of-living issues, from slashing the price of beef to holding out hope that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates and bring mortgage rates down.\nBut just as critical as making progress on affordability is ensuring voters feel it, aides and advisers acknowledged. And while Trump has been told he needs to make a more sympathetic case, he\u2019s remained reluctant so far to buy into that approach completely.\n\u201cWe brought prices way down from what it was,\u201d Trump said Monday, declaring inflation \u201cessentially gone\u201d despite an acceleration in prices in recent months. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the greatest economy in history.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/09\/politics\/pennsylvania-trump-speech-prices-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"US stocks rally but Dow posts worst week since 2023","date":"2025-03-14","body":"What a week it\u2019s been.\nUS stocks surged Friday but all three major indexes still closed the week in the red. President Donald Trump\u2019s budding trade war has sent jitters through markets that caused avolatile weekon Wall Street.\nThe Dow ended the day higher by 675 points, or 1.65%. The broader S&P 500 rose 2.13% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.61%.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallied Friday to notch their best single-day gains since the US presidential election. Yet it wasn\u2019t enough to drag the indexes out of the red for this week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their fourth consecutive week in the red, which is their worst losing streak in seven months.\nDespite the Friday rally, the blue-chip Dow closed down roughly 3.1% this week and posted its worst week since March 2023.\nFriday\u2019s rebound in stocks came after a steep decline on Thursday that saw the S&P 500 close incorrection territory, down more than 10% from its recent high, for the first time since late 2023.\nThe benchmark index shed roughly $5.28 trillion in market value from its peak on February 19 to market close on March 13, according to FactSet data.\nUS stocks rallied on the news that lawmakers would likely pass agovernment funding planFriday, avoiding a shutdown. Markets hate uncertainty, and hopes of dodging a shutdown provided a boost for stocks at the end of a turbulent week.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs have roiled markets this month, and recent drawdowns can also present opportunities for rebounds.\n\u201cThe markets are grappling with the notion of where fair value rests for a stock market that faces headwinds from tariffs, fiscal spending cuts and potentially softening economic data,\u201d said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management, in an email.\nMa said he expects a \u201cmulti-day relief rally could be coming soon\u201d due to how much negative investor sentiment has built up recently. \u201cExtreme fear\u201d has been the sentiment driving markets since the end of February, according toCNN\u2019s Fear and Greed Index.\nAll three major indexes opened higher Friday and held on to their gains despite a fresh read on consumer sentiment that showed Americans aresouring on the economy.\nConsumer sentiment fell 11% this month to a reading of 57.9, a preliminary reading showed, down from last month\u2019s reading of 64.7 and reaching its lowest level since November 2022, according to the latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan.\nStocks driving markets higher on Friday included tech and AI stars like Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) that rebounded after a slide in the past month.\nTesla (TSLA), which hadplunged earlierin the week, gained 3.86% on Friday after gaining 3% on Thursday.\nGold on Friday surged to a record high, breaking through $3,000 a troy ounce. Gold prices have soared as investors demand safe havens amid uncertainty around the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on global economic growth and geopolitical stability.\nThe skyrocketing price of gold is among several signs that investors are concerned about America\u2019s economic outlook, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told CNN on Friday.\nRelated articleGold prices hit $3,000 for the first time as investors push the panic button\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the amount of uncertainty that\u2019s being created that amidst everything else, the asset that\u2019s done well is gold,\u201d Summers told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown and Wolf Blitzer. \u201cThat\u2019s what people do when they don\u2019t have confidence in the people who are managing the country.\u201d\nGold prices rallied 27% in 2024, smashing through previous record highs.\nIn addition to investor demand, central banks \u2014 led by China \u2014 have been increasing theirgold reserves, pushing prices higher. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is another factor contributing to higher gold prices.\n\u201cRussia\u2019s rejection of the US-proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine has reignited geopolitical instability,\u201d said Viktoria Kuszak, a research analyst at Sucden Financial, a trading firm.\nGold is up almost 15% already this year, far outpacing the benchmark S&P 500, which is down more than 4%.\nGoldman Sachs in February raised its year-end price forecast for gold to $3,100 a troy ounce.\nCNN\u2019s Olesya Dmitracova and Bryan Mena contributed reporting.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/14\/investing\/us-stocks-volatile-week","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"With Trump\u2019s focus abroad, Republicans push for midterms pivot to economy","date":"2025-12-03","body":"Some of PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s closest allies in Congress are warning that the party needs to sharpen its affordability message to voters heading into the 2026 elections \u2014 or risk big losses that would shackle him for the rest of his second term.\n\u201cI would love him to get back to driving around in the garbage truck, going to McDonald\u2019s. Go to a supermarket, go to a farm. That\u2019s when he\u2019s at his best,\u201d Rep. Jeff Van Drew told CNN, recalling a message he conveyed to the president in a lengthy phone call earlier this week. \u201cNext year, we got to concentrate \u2014 the American people first.\u201d\nVan Drew, a New Jersey Republican in a purple seat, said he\u2019s not worried about his own reelection but is concerned for the political survival of \u201cmany of my friends, some people who won by one or two or three points.\u201d And he\u2019s worried about the HouseGOP\u2019s fragile majoritynext November.\nMany Republicans in Washington were already privately anxious that their party lacked a clear domestic agenda in Congress, as Trump himself devoted much of the fall to overseas crises. Those fears escalated this week, after their GOP candidate in a special election for a ruby-red Tennessee congressional districtwon on Tuesdayby just nine points, after Trump himself won the seat by 22 points a year earlier.\nInside the party, GOP lawmakers and top strategists acknowledge that the Republican Party \u2013 including Trump \u2013 need to remind voters they are focused on making life more affordable for everyday Americans, with less emphasis on conflicts likeRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraineorstrikes on alleged drug boatsin the Caribbean. In the House, that means an \u200beconomy-focused policy agenda in 2026, rather than party infighting on issues like therelease of the Jeffrey Epstein case filesorlawmaker censure votesdominating floor time.\nIt\u2019s not clear yet exactly how or when party leaders will make the pivot, with Trump himself calling the affordability issue a \u201cscam\u201d anda \u201ccon job\u201dby Democrats at aTuesday Cabinet meeting.\nThe day after the Tennessee special election, Trump again said that affordability is a \u201cDemocrat hoax\u201d while unveiling plans to rescind fuel-economy standards for vehicles put in place under the Biden administration \u2014 a move he said would save Americans money.\n\u201cThey use the word \u2018affordability\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s a Democrat hoax. They\u2019re the ones that drove the prices up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey never talk about, like, the specifics.\u201d\n\u201cI think affordability is the greatest con job. They look at you and say \u2018affordability,\u2019 they don\u2019t say anything else,\u201d he said.\nBut the pressure to do more on the economy is mounting, and it\u2019s not just battleground Republicans who are sounding the alarm. Ultraconservative GOP Rep. Tim Burchett called Tuesday\u2019s special election in his home state a \u201cwake up\u201d call, warning that \u201ccomplacency within our party is a problem.\u201d\n\u201cThe best friend the Democrats have right now is the Republicans messaging, because we do a terrible job of messaging,\u201d Burchett said, lamenting the lack of enthusiasm within the party\u2019s own base, particularly with economic concerns creeping up. \u201cWe got a real problem, and we better wake up.\u201d\nAcross the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he, too, was eying the results in Tennessee as a sign that the party needed to better focus its message, even as he downplayed the results from an off-year race that comes with its own unique circumstances.\n\u201cI think, obviously, we need to take to heart the fact that we have to sharpen our message, make sure that we\u2019re giving people a reason to vote for us in the midterms next year,\u201d Thune said.\nHe added that Republicans needed strong candidates, good messaging, and healthy financial resources next year: \u201cThose are the ingredients to a successful election, and we got some work and some challenges ahead of us this next year.\u201d\n(His counterpart, Speaker Mike Johnson, brushed off any signals from the race, telling reporters: \u201cI\u2019m not concerned at all.\u201d)\nSome of Trump\u2019s GOP critics in Congress have gone after him directly for his recent focus on military campaigns abroad. That includes Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has attacked him nearly every day on social media for ignoring issues at home.\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was also blunt in his criticism: \u201cI think that people voted for Donald Trump because they wanted less foreign war.\u201d\n\u201cVenezuela is still foreign war. Just because it\u2019s in our hemisphere doesn\u2019t make it a lot different. and so I think there\u2019s a large portion of his supporters that will be very upset with a war in Venezuela,\u201d Paul said on the escalating conflict against alleged drug trafficking in South America.\nFor many Republicans, the most immediate concern is health care. The party is facing a glaring affordability crisis on December 31, when enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire, threatening to spike health care premiums for tens of millions of people.\nNo one in GOP leadership or in the White House has yet indicated how they plan to address the expiring subsidies that help lower the cost of Obamacare, even as dozens of their own members push the party to strike a deal with Democrats to avert the cliff.\nOne of those Republicans is Sen. Josh Hawley, a close Trump ally who has repeatedly urged his party to embrace the growing number of working class voters in their base \u2014 and to put affordability at the center of their agenda.\nHawley has pushed hard for GOP leaders to strike a deal to avert steep price hikes for those Obamacare plans, in addition to pushing his own bill to allow individual taxpayers to deduct up to $25,000 in medical expenses.\n\u201cWe have got to help people be able to afford the necessities of life and just get by day to day. And there\u2019s no better place to start than health care. Nothing costs more than health care,\u201d the Missouri Republican told CNN.\nAsked if the party gets the message, Hawley said: \u201cWell, we\u2019ll find out. The president gets it. \u2026 He realizes Congress needs to act, and we do. We need to act.\u201d\nGOP Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents a battleground seat, said he expects party leaders to make a \u201cconscious effort\u201d to focus on affordability in 2026, adding: \u201cAnd I hope it\u2019s done in a way that\u2019s actually going to help, as opposed to just trying.\u201d\nKiley has been publicly and privately critical of his party leadership for failing to do more on the issue, frustrated that the House stayed out of session for nearly two months during the fall government shutdown.\n\u201cWe could have been working on these issues every single day for the last several months. Bringing bills that would move the needle. Working on bipartisan deals. To address the cost of housing, the cost of energy, the cost of health care and everything else. Unfortunately the House wasted a lot of time,\u201d Kiley said.\nBut he believes it\u2019s not too late. \u201cI think everyone agrees that affordability needs to be at the center of any agenda. Americans are really frustrated right now,\u201d he said.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\nFrom CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett, Veronica Stracqualursi, Alison Main and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/03\/politics\/republicans-midterm-message-economy-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"After Trump trade meeting, it\u2019s advantage Xi","date":"2025-10-31","body":"As the dust begins to clear around aless-than-two hour meetingbetween Chinese leader Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump at an airbase in South Korea on Thursday, it\u2019s clear that China\u2019s leaders have stacked up another win for their hardball strategy with the United States.\nThe meeting did not secure a broad trade deal, but rather a return to an uneasy truce built on a handful of agreements meant to keep the relationship steady as the two sides move toward one.\nXi walked away with a 10% reduction in 30% tariffs newly imposed by Trump on Chinese goods this year \u2013 in exchange forramping up efforts to control its role in the US fentanyl crisis. He also secured US agreement to put on hold a new rule that would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American tech.\nTrump averted Beijing imposing an expanded set of restrictions that could have hamstrung global industries reliant on China\u2019s rare earths minerals. China will also ramp up purchases of US soybeans and other agricultural products, US officials said. Both sides also paused port fees targeting each other\u2019s shipping sectors and will extend a truce on more elevated tariffs.\nOn paper, it looks like a reasonable exchange \u2013 and one that delivers, at least for now, what both leaders (and the wider global economy) wanted: stability after a tumultuous year of sparring between the world\u2019s economic heavyweights.\nBut for Beijing, the agreements \u2013 which came with a side of effusive praise from Trump for Xi \u2013 are also a clear confirmation of the success of its strategy in how to handle Trump 2.0.\nThat\u2019s because Beijing has been able to win valuable concessions on tariffs and export controls, while primarily conceding measures they only put out as retaliation against those from the US in the first place.\nTake soybeans, a key American export that saw Chinese purchases plunge this year over trade frictions.\nChina agreed to purchase a minimum of 25 million metric tons of American soybeans annually for the next three years, US agricultural secretary Brooke Rollinssaidafter the talks.\nBut that baseline is still 1.8 million metric tons less than China\u2019s soybean purchases last year, before the tensions, according toUS data.\nChina\u2019s highly nationalistic and censor-curated internet clocked all this on Friday, when social media commenters praised how \u201cChina really nailed this tariff war,\u201d and observed that \u201cTrump finally dealt with the mess Trump created.\u201d\nThe outlook is not all rosy for China.\nEven as tariffs from this year\u2019s US trade spat have been whittled down to 20%, Chinese exporters still face what on average amounts to nearly 50% duties on their goods, with pre-existing duties factored in. That rate remains among the highest imposed on any country by the US. Washington meanwhile has seenreal progresson its goal to narrow their trade deficit.\nAnd, while the deal has yet to be inked, Beijing may have made some true concessions on the fate of the social media app TikTok, after changing its tune on staunch opposition to a US law requiring the app\u2019s Chinese owner ByteDance to sell its US business.\nChina also remains blocked from accessing the highest-end US chips, a key weapon in the high-stakes AI race playing out between the two countries.\nBut on the tech front, Beijing\u2019s ability to push back by at least a year the new US rule which would have vastly expanded the number of Chinese companies blacklisted from buying sensitive American technologies, is a major boon for Chinese firms.\nThe now-suspended US effort to close loopholes could have ensnared some 20,000 more companies than are already on the list, according toan analysisby business intelligence firm WireScreen.\nThat\u2019s another win for Beijing\u2019s strategy of using its near-total grip on the global rare earths supply chain as leverage against the US \u2013 a tactic it also deployed during a tariff escalation earlier this year.\nAnd on China\u2019s side, agreeing to defer for at least a year its expanded export control regime on rare earth minerals, which it announced as retaliation for the US blacklist expansion, is unlikely to be seen as a major setback in Beijing.\nAs one Chinese scholar, foreign policy analyst Shen Dingli, told CNN earlier this month, those measures were a \u201cnuclear\u201d option that Beijing knew wasn\u2019t symmetrical \u2013 \u201cbut if China doesn\u2019t use this weapon, China has little left to bargain with.\u201d\nWhether Xi and Trump can manage to keep the detente as they work toward a broader deal and expected visits to each other\u2019s countries in 2026 is the next big question.\nCanada, after all, knows first-hand that a trade truce struck with Trumpcan quickly collapse.\nA range of pitfalls, both foreseeable and unexpected, in the US and China\u2019s expansive rivalry could derail the newly-reached stabilty \u2013 and whatever deal is ultimately reached isunlikely to address the deep-seated, structural issues between the two.\nBut as Trump took off from South Korea\u2019s Gimhae International Airport on Thursday, to return to a US stuck in the quagmire of a frozen government,Xi stayed onto join an international summit and tout China as a beacon for globalization, it\u2019s clear the balance of power between them has shifted.\nCNN\u2019s John Liu and Joyce Jiang contributed reporting","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/31\/china\/xi-trump-us-china-deal-analysis-intl-hnk","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Roiled by purges and buffeted by US frictions, China\u2019s leadership meets to chart country\u2019s rise","date":"2025-10-19","body":"Chinese leader Xi Jinping is convening a key political meeting this week where he will push forward his next five-year strategy to strengthen theworld\u2019s second-largest economyin the face of mounting friction with the United States.\nThe gathering, known as the fourth plenum, provides an opportune moment for Xi to showcase China\u2019s brand of highly choreographed economic planning and his tight control over its political apparatus, days before a potential meeting with US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of an international summit in South Korea.\nIt also underscores the sharp contrast between the two countries as they compete across tech and trade arenas. Gathering Communist Party elites will review China\u2019s upcoming five-year plan, an economic blueprint whose direction is strictly dictated by top leadership in the authoritarian state. Meanwhile, theUS government shutdownstretches toward its third week as democratically elected lawmakers remain locked in a standoff over spending in the year ahead.\nThe plenum will be closely monitored by outsiders for clues about the inner workings of China\u2019s opaque ruling Communist Party. Intrigue heightened on Friday, when state media announced theousting of China\u2019s No. 2 general, the highest-ranking casualty yet of Xi\u2019s ongoing anti-corruption purge of the armed forces.\nThe conclave comes at a critical time for Beijing. China\u2019s leadership sees itself as navigating an increasingly hostile global landscape \u2013 with US trade frictions and mounting restrictions on Chinese access to Western technology \u2013 while also grappling with deep-seated economic challenges at home.\nChina\u2019s economic growth slowed to its lowest point this year in the third quarter, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, which reported 4.8% growth year-on-year \u2013 down from 5.2% the previous quarter \u2013 as those pressures weigh on the economy.\nMore than 300 full and non-voting delegates of the powerful Central Committee will gather in Beijing for the closed-door plenum, one of seven meetings typically held within five years, between party congresses.\nThe five-year plan in focus this week is expected to emphasize China\u2019s economic security and technological innovation in sectors like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, new energy and biotechnology. It will run from 2026 through the end of the decade.\nBut that won\u2019t be the only item on the agenda, and the conclave may also include a personnel reshuffle if new officials are appointed to key roles vacated by those purged.\nFull details of the upcoming five-year plan will not emerge until after it is approved by China\u2019s rubber-stamp legislature in March next year. But Xi has already given strong hints about his priorities as he looks to adjust China\u2019s economic strategy to ensure \u201chigh-quality development\u201d for the rest of the decade.\nIt\u2019s a decade that Xi could well see out in power. The strongman leader broke precedent to remain head of the party and the state for a third term starting in 2022, and has so far avoided elevating an heir apparent.\nXi earlier this year called on provincial leaders to spend the next five years focusing on the development of emerging and future industries and breakthroughs in core and cutting-edge technologies, while also coordinating \u201cdevelopment and security\u201d and considering \u201cinternal and external risks.\u201d\nChinese electric cars are going global. A cut-throat price war at home could kill off many of its brands\nChina has already made sweeping advances in high-tech industries, like electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries, and is fast catching up with the US in other advanced areas like semiconductors, AI and biotech \u2013 sectors included in the current five-year plan, which ends this year.\nBut the country\u2019s industrial innovation has also been marred by production overcapacity. A surge of production has fueled frictions with trade partners that accuse China of flooding global markets, while also contributing to persistent deflation and price wars between competing firms at home.\nChina\u2019s economy also needs rebalancing as it faces a prolonged property slump, persistent deflation, weak consumer demand and high youth employment, as well as longer-term concerns like its rapidly aging and shrinking population.\nChina\u2019s slowing growth in the third quarter relative to the rest of the year increases pressure on the Communist Party to accomplish its annual growth target of around 5%. Overall, the economy has grown 5.2% year-on-year in the first three quarters.\nOfficials on Monday attributed the third quarter decline to a \u201ccomplex and severe external environment,\u201d including the impact of tariffs on the global economy, as well as China\u2019s economic transition between \u201cnew and old\u201d drivers of growth.\nDespite the economic headwinds, many observers expect Xi will largely look to stay the course he\u2019s already charted for China, while making some targeted adjustments.\n\u201cThere are few reasons to expect that a new five-year plan would deviate, considering that Xi Jinping has been in control of the whole system now very definitively \u2026 and doesn\u2019t need to have a big headline (initiative)\u201d at this stage, said Jacob Gunter, who heads the economy and industry program at MERICS think tank in Berlin.\nGunter said to expect \u201csome signaling\u201d in the coming plan around boosting consumption and addressing \u201cinvolution\u201d \u2013 or cutthroat domestic competition linked to overcapacity. But signs of a deeper shift, if it comes, would include meaningful efforts in the coming months and years to expand the social safety net and tackle issues around subsidies and over-investment, among others, he said.\nAll eyes will also be on any personnel changes that could take place this week, including potential appointments to the powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees China\u2019s 2 million-strong armed forces.\nThe CMC has been rocked by Xi\u2019s anti-corruption purge, with three of the body\u2019s six uniformed members ousted since 2023, including He Weidong, the No. 2 general.\nThe announcement of his removal Friday confirmed months of speculation about He\u2019s fate after hevanished from public view last March. He, who served as a CMC vice chairman, was also a member of the 24-member Politburo, the second-highest echelon of Communist Party leadership.\nHis ousting from the party was announced alongside that of fellow CMC member Miao Hua, who was removed from his military position in June, as well as seven other officers. All \u201cwere suspected of severe duty-related crimes involving exceptionally large amounts of money,\u201d according to state media.\nThe shake-up leaves an unusual number of spots open on the party\u2019s Central Committee, which began its term in 2022 with 205 members and 171 non-voting alternates. About a dozen seats are expected to be filled by alternate members at this plenum.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Xi will choose to refill the ranks of the CMC, which he chairs \u2013 or whether he will prefer to keep his close hold on the smaller group.\nThe existing vacancies on the Central Committee and the potential for other disciplinary moves this week could bring \u201cthe biggest personnel shake-up\u201d at a plenum since at least 2017, according to Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n\u201cRecord purges strengthen, not weaken, Xi\u2019s grip over the party and the (People\u2019s Liberation Army). Every Central Committee member knows their future hinges on staying in Xi\u2019s good graces,\u201d he said.\nCNN\u2019s Nectar Gan and John Liu contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/19\/china\/china-fourth-plenum-ccp-meeting-intl-hnk","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"Nvidia beats earnings expectations, even as bubble concerns mount","date":"2025-11-19","body":"Nvidia posted strong revenue and profits that exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations Wednesday. The closely watched result could prompt a sigh of relief across the stock market following growing concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble.\nNvidia\u2019s sales grew 62% year-over-year to $57 billion in the October quarter, ahead of the $54.9 billion Wall Street had projected, signaling that demand for AI chips remains strong even as more questions emerge about whether returns from the technology will keep up with the pace of infrastructure investments. It posted profits of $31.9 billion, up 65% from the year-ago quarter and also slightly above expectations.\n\u201cBlackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, a message that echoes his earlier arguments that fears of an AI bubble are overblown.\nThe company also posted stronger-than-expected sales guidance of around $65 billion for the fourth quarter, another indicator that the AI spending spree isn\u2019t slowing anytime soon.\nNvidia\u2019s stock (NVDA) jumped 3.4% in after-hours trading immediately following the report.\nNvidia has become both the backbone and an emblem of the AI boom, with much of the industry\u2019s technology running on its chips. Theworld\u2019s most valuable public companyhas also been central to this year\u2019s stock market rally \u2014 it accounts for roughly 8% of the S&P 500 and its deals with other tech firms have helped fuel their stocks, too \u2014 meaning that nearly all investors and 401k holdersstand to be impactedby Wednesday\u2019s results.\nFears of an AI bubble ahead of Nvidia\u2019s report had caused volatility across the stock market as investors adopted a risk-off attitude and dumped assets like bitcoin and AI stocks.\nShares of other tech stocks \u2014 including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google \u2014 were in the green in after-hours trading following the Nvidia report, underscoring the chipmaker\u2019s impact on the wider market.\n\u201cThis answers a lot of questions about the state of the AI revolution, and the verdict is simple: it is nowhere near its peak, neither from the market-demand nor the production\u2013supply-chain sides for the foreseeable future,\u201d Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in emailed commentary following the report.\nAt the heart of the bubble concerns are the circular funding deals that Nvidia and other chipmakers have formed with AI companies, such as a$100 billion investmentin OpenAI in exchange for chip purchases that was announced in September. OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar further raised eyebrows earlier this month whenshe suggestedthat the government should backstop the debt tech companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure \u2014 a statement the company later tried to walk back.\nBut the fears haven\u2019t stopped Nvidia from making more such deals. Anthropic on Mondaycommittedto buying $30 billion in computing capacity from Microsoft Azure, running on Nvidia chips, in exchange for an investment in the AI lab from both tech giants.\nHuang has repeatedly batted down bubble concerns. At the company\u2019s GTC AI conference last month, he told CNN that people\u2019s willingness to pay for AI tools indicates that the technology is \u201cprofitable,\u201d even if most tech firms are now reinvesting the money they\u2019re earning into new infrastructure.\nThe fact that Nvidia\u2019s business continues to hum isn\u2019t surprising given that tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Googleall indicatedin their most recent earnings reports that they plan to continue hiking their AI infrastructure spending. Huang alsolaid outat GTC the company\u2019s plans to get its technology into even more areas of life \u2014 from cell phone towers to self- driving cars.\nNvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress sought to reinforce that AI is generating returns in the company\u2019s earnings call by taking the unusual tack of ticking through highlights from the chipmaker\u2019s partner\u2019s recent financial reports. At Meta, for example, AI recommendation systems are leading to \u201cmore time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads;\u201d Anthropic recently noted it expects to earn $7 billion in annual revenue this year; and Salesforce\u2019s engineering team is 30% more efficient now that it\u2019s using AI for coding, she said, \ufeffamong a long list of corporate customers she rattled off.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/19\/tech\/nvidia-earnings-ai-bubble-fears","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

The university\u2019s index of consumer sentiment is down almost 30% since January, according to Friday\u2019s report.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that consumers are bracing for the uncertainty and instability of tariff policy,\u201d Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Surveys of Consumers, said Friday during an interview on Bloomberg TV.\nThree-quarters of survey respondents spontaneously mentioned tariffs, up from 60% in April.\nAnd consumers, across both major parties, wholly expect tariffs to be painfully pricey: Year-ahead inflation expectations leapt to 7.3% from 6.5%, Friday\u2019s report showed.\nThe current economic conditions index dropped as well, landing at 57.6, which is the lowest reading since December 2022.\nSentiment was particularly sour for consumers\u2019 future outlooks. The university\u2019s index of consumer expectations fell for the fifth month in a row (since November 2024) to 47.3, the lowest since July 2022.\nConsumers \u201care understandably feeling a bit worse about where the economy is headed,\u201d Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, told CNN in an interview. \u201cEqually important to negotiating down the tariffs and getting trade deals is communication to the people about where these things are headed and what they can expect.\u201d\nEconomists expected that sentiment could improve in May, forecasting a reading of 55, according to FactSet estimates.\nThere have been positive developments in Trump\u2019s trade war to start the month, notably anunexpected d\u00e9tente and de-escalationin tariffs between the US and China, announced in full on May 12. The survey period for the preliminary report ended May 13.\nMany survey measures did show signs of improvement following the 90-day reduction in China\u2019s import tariffs from 145% to 30%, Hsu noted in Friday\u2019s report.\n\u201cBut these initial upticks were too small to alter the overall picture \u2014 consumers continue to express somber views about the economy,\u201d she said in the report.\nHowever, May\u2019s initial reading is the second-lowest on record, wedging itself between June 2022\u2019sall-time low of 50and the slight improvement to 51.5 seen in July 2022.\nNearly three years ago, inflation was raging; however, the labor market was strong, and consumers hadthe firepower to keep spending.\nThat may not be the case this time around, Hsu said during the Bloomberg TV interview.\n\u201cConsumers are really worried that labor markets are going to weaken\u201d she said, adding that a growing share reported their incomes have already been dinged.\n\u201cThis is definitely a concerning crack in the resilience of consumers,\u201d she added.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/16\/economy\/consumer-sentiment-may-preliminary","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The latest chapter of the Trump-Xi \u2018situationship\u2019 explained","date":"2025-10-18","body":"Another spat between the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest economies has quickly escalated, and if President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping don\u2019t lower the temperature soon, both nations stand to pay an exorbitant price.\nSky-high tariffs had brought trade between the two countries to a screeching halt earlier this year, before they reached a monthslong truce and substantially lowered levies on one another.\nBut trade tensions have reignited, with Trump threatening to impose tariffsstarting at 130%on Chinese exports by November 1, up from the 30% minimum rate currently in effect. Trump also said he\u2019s prepared to impose export controls on what he referred to as \u201cany and all critical software\u201d to China. Beijing has signaled it would retaliate to all these actions.\nOn Friday, Trump sounded confident he and Xi could resolve matters amicably, telling reporters that he intends to still meet with the Chinese leader on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month. And US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who helps lead trade negotiations with China, said Friday that \u201cthings have deescalated\u201d recently.\nBut that was Friday. At any second, the tide could turn.\nSo, how did we get here?\nEarlier this month,Beijing announcedplans to restrict exports of rare-earth minerals, critical materials needed to power a wide range of electronics. Under the new rules set to take effect later this year, five rare-earth elements were added to China\u2019s existing list of seven other highly restricted rare-earth exports.\nFurthermore, China\u2019s plan calls for mandated licenses for technology needed to mine, smelt and process rare earths, and to make magnets. Foreign governments and businesses would also need licenses to exchange Chinese-sourced rare earths or technology containing them.\nThe country\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said the restrictions aim to prevent materials from \u201cbeing used, directly or indirectly, in military and other sensitive fields.\u201d\nWhat are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump\u2019s threats against China?\nA day after Beijing announced those measures, Trump took to Truth Social, saying, \u201cOur relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one.\u201d\nHe went on to say that China has \u201cquietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position\u201d with rare earths and called the new restrictions \u201ca rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least.\u201d\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who has worked on trade agreements with China alongside Bessent, said last week: \u201cIt\u2019s a clear repudiation of everything we\u2019ve been working towards for the last six months, which was a stable tariff situation and a continued flow of rare earths.\u201d\nBeijing\u2019s actions came after a series of moves Washington took that drew the ire of Chinese counterparts.\nAmong them wereramped-up restrictionson worldwide exports to Chinese tech giants, including Huawei, of any parts of products manufactured using American equipment or software.\nA spokesperson for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce called the move announced last month \u201cextremely malicious,\u201d adding that the country would \u201ctake necessary measures\u201d to protect the rights and interests of its companies.\nThe Trump administration earlier this month also started taxing Chinese ships docked at American ports as well as products transported on Chinese-made ships. Beijing responded with a tit-for-tat fee at its ports.\nWashington, meanwhile, up until recently, kept extremely tight restrictions on exports of highly advanced chips, aiming to prevent Beijing from making more advancements in artificial intelligence.\nA meeting between Trump and Xi at APEC could be an opportunity to hash out their differences face to face as opposed to through American and Chinese officials. But things could just as easily devolve, pushing the two nations even further apart.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/18\/economy\/trump-xi-tariff-trade","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"CNN Poll: Optimism about the economy sags as 55% say cuts to federal programs will cause harm","date":"2025-03-13","body":"Concerns about the nation\u2019s economy have grown in the first months of PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s return to office, according to anew CNN poll conducted by SSRS, as few Americans see his policies as having helped economic conditions and 55% say his cuts to federal programs will do economic harm.\nAmericans split evenly over whether economic conditions a year from now will be good (49%) or poor (51%), but the share saying they expect the economy to be in bad shape a year from now is up 7 points since January, just before Trump took office. Jitters on Wall Street about Trump\u2019s economic policies have sent the stock market into a decline, and Trump has given mixed messages on whether he believes it\u2019s possible the economy is headed into a recession.\nAbout half of the public, 51%, say they think Trump\u2019s policies have worsened economic conditions and just 28% that they have improved things. Another 21% say they\u2019ve had no effect on the economy.\nTrump\u2019s approval rating for handling the economy \u2013 broadly seen as the country\u2019s most pressing problem \u2013 mirrors his overall approval rating (45% approve overall, 44% on the economy), a departure from the pattern seen in his first term where perceptions of his handling of the economy were nearly always more positive than those of his presidency overall. Trump scores similar reviews for his handling of inflation (44% approve) and helping the middle class (43% approve). And only 39% approve of the way he\u2019s handling tariffs, his lowest approval rating across 11 issues tested in the poll.\nThe poll suggests though that even as some indicators of confidence have emerged under Trump, measures on views of the economy are stagnant. Findings released earlier from the same poll find a growing share saying things in the US are going well (35%, up from 29% in January), but the share calling the economy good has held steady (28%, the same as in January).\nPeople\u2019s satisfaction with their personal finances is up compared with the summer of 2023, and fewer now say they\u2019re cutting back on driving or having trouble finding affordable housing. But about 7 in 10 say they\u2019re changing the groceries they buy to stay within budget and roughly two-thirds say that they\u2019ve had to cut back on extra spending, similar to two years ago.\nSome of this change is driven by the partisan shift in views of the economy that happens any time the presidency moves from one party to the other. Even as the overall assessment of the economy has held steady, for example, Democrats and Republicans have switched places on it. Before Trump took office in January, 48% of Democrats and 14% of Republicans said they thought economic conditions in the US were good, and now, 48% of Republicans and 14% of Democrats feel that way. Views among independents have held steady and remain deeply negative: 22% now say the economy is good and 78% that it\u2019s poor, about the same as in January.\nBut the shift in outlook for the future suggests that any economic optimism Trump may have inspired in Democrats and independents is diminishing. Republicans are about as likely as they were in January to say they expect the economy to be in good shape one year from now (88% now, 85% in January), but among independents (54% in January, 41% now) and Democrats (31% in January, 18% now) those numbers have fallen precipitously.\nAmericans expect negative repercussions specifically due to Trump\u2019s cuts to federal programs. Most (55%) say they think those cuts will hurt the US economy, and nearly as many say the cuts will have a direct negative impact on their family (51%) or on the area where they live (52%). Only about a third of Americans say they expect those cuts to help the economy (34%), and fewer expect that they will have a positive impact on their family or community (22% each).\nAsked to describe how Trump\u2019s cuts might affect their families, respondents who see the cuts as more of a help often focused on reduced taxes (25% mentioned the impact on taxes as a positive) and how those shifts in spending could eventually help the economy. Said one respondent, \u201cCut federal spending, eventually taxes and cost of living.\u201d And another, \u201cHopefully with all the fraudulent money being recovered they can use that money to strengthen our economy and get us out of debt.\u201d\nBut on the flip side, the larger group that see negative personal impacts from the cuts highlighted a range of concerns including increased costs, mental anguish and personal job loss. Many (14%) cited negative impacts to Medicare, Medicaid or health care more broadly, 13% mentioned impacts on prices and the cost of living, and 9% mentioned the impact on Social Security or their retirement savings. One respondent wrote, \u201cGas prices will go up, groceries will go up, businesses will slow down [due] to uncertainty including the one I work at, and I\u2019m pretty sure my 401k will suffer.\u201d\nAnother reported that what they\u2019ve experienced so far is, \u201cStress, depression, hopelessness, fear.  Mainly psychological so far but we\u2019re old enough to think we\u2019re watching the end of our democracy in our lifetimes.\u201d\nSeveral expressed very specific concerns about direct impacts. Wrote one respondent, \u201cI hike and hunt in national forest. Which I think will not be up kept as well as in the past. And as a parent I fear what will happen if\/when he guts the department of education. My father is 100% disabled veteran and wondering what will happen to his care from the VA.\u201d\nThe poll also finds a notable drop in economic optimism among younger adults, a voting bloc where exit polls in the 2024 election found Trump making up some ground compared with other recent Republican candidates for president. Among those age 18-34, the share expecting economic conditions to be in good shape a year from now has dipped from 54% in January to 43% now. Younger adults do tend to be more Democratic than older adults, but the shift within this age group appears to come across party lines even as older Republicans have become more confident in the nation\u2019s economic outlook.\nAmericans in the youngest age group are generally less satisfied than older Americans with their personal finances (36% among those younger than 35 are satisfied, compared with majorities age 50 or older) and are significantly more likely to have made changes to their grocery buying or cut their non-essential spending as a result of recent economic conditions.\nNearly all Democrats (86%) and most independents (57%), say that Trump\u2019s policies have worsened the economy, while just 10% of Republicans say the same. About 6 in 10 Republicans (61%) say the president\u2019s policies have improved economic conditions, with 30% saying they\u2019ve had no effect.\nBroad majorities of Democrats see Trump\u2019s cuts to federal programs as hurtful to themselves, their area and the US economy more broadly (more than 8 in 10 say they will hurt each of those areas). Republicans are more mixed, expressing broad optimism about the effect of the cuts on the economy (74% say they will help), but less confidence that they will have a positive impact on their families (48%) or communities (47%), although most don\u2019t expect outright negative effects from either.\nThe CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from March 6-9 among a random national sample of 1,206 US adults drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among all adults have a margin of sampling error of \u00b13.3 percentage points.\nCNN\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy and Edward Wu contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/13\/politics\/cnn-poll-economy-worries","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 12.16%.\nIn a massive turnaround, the S&P 500 posted its best day since October 2008.It was alsothe third-best day for the benchmark index since its modern-day version was formed in 1957.\nThe Nasdaq posted its best day since January 2001 and its second-best day in its history. The Dow posted its best day in five years.\n\u201cThe market\u2019s move upward is violent, and speaks to how badly the market was looking for clarity on this issue,\u201d said Chris Brigati, chief investment officer at SWBC, an investment firm in San Antonio, Texas.\nRelated articleTrump announces 90-day pause on \u2018reciprocal\u2019 tariffs with exception of China\nThe positive shift was widespread. Nearly every single company in the S&P 500 rose, according to data from FactSet.\nAmazon (AMZN) rose 11.98%. Nike (NKE) gained 11.36%. Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) soared 26.14%, Delta Air Lines (DAL) surged 23.38% and American Airlines (AAL) surged 22.6%.\nOn the Nasdaq, Apple (AAPL) surged 15.33%. Nvidia (NVDA) rose 18.72%. Palantir (PLTR) gained 19%. Tesla (TSLA) surged 22.69%.\nThe S&P 500 is now up 12.86% from its nadir reached two days ago, but is still down more than 3.7% from its close on April 2, right before Trump initially announced his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs. The Nasdaq is still 2.7% down from its close on April 2.\nBefore the upward swing, the S&P 500 had been on the precipice of bear market territory, coming close to a stunningly rapid drop of 20% from the all-time high it hit just seven weeks ago on February 19. The S&P closed down 11.2% from its record high in February.\nFollowing Trump\u2019s announcement, investors scooped up stocks and markets soared. Yet uncertainty remains as Trump still escalated the trade war with China, raising its tariff rates to 125% from 104%. Additionally, universal duties of 10% remain on all US imports alongside the targeted, sectoral tariffs on autos.\nWall Street breathed a sigh of relief as markets rallied, but investors are not necessarily in the clear.\n\u201cTrump illustrated to everyone in the market today how incredibly difficult it is to trade around his tariff regime, because he and only he knows when it ends,\u201d said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.\nJust after the opening bell on Wednesday, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: \u201cBE COOL!\u201d and \u201cThis is a great time to buy!!!\u201d\nIn an exchange with CNN\u2019s Alayna Treene on Wednesday, Trump declined to say if the markets were ultimately what prompted his reversal on tariffs.\n\u201cThe markets right now are extremely good,\u201d he said.\nUS stocks initially had a mixed start to the dayafter China announced significant retaliation and the European Union announced countermeasures against Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs that had gone into effect earlier in the day.\nHowever, markets surged after Trumpannouncedthat all countries \u2014 besides China \u2014 subjected to reciprocal tariff rates would see rates go back down to the universal 10% rate.\nChina, an extreme outlier, now faces a US tariff of at least 125%, compounding the new tariffs with ones already in place.\nTrump touted the market reaction to the announcement in a hot-mic moment at the White House Wednesday that was captured by CNN pool.\nTrump, greeting lawmakers at a NASCAR event on the White House South Lawn, was approached by Wyoming Senator John Barrasso who told him: \u201cYou got the markets seeing your brilliance.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s up almost 7 (percentage) points, 2500 points, nobody\u2019s ever heard of it. It\u2019s gonna be a record,\u201d Trump said in reply.\nFear has gripped investors across the world as the escalating trade war threatens to throw the global and US economies into a recession this year. Businesses and consumers will end up footing tariff bills, and uncertainty has led to a slowdown in hiring and consumer spending.\nEarlier in the day, global markets had fallen. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index closed 4% down, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng finished marginally higher. On Monday, the Hang Seng tanked in a 13% rout \u2013 thebiggest daily declinefor the index since the 1997 Asian financial crisis.\nSouth Korea\u2019s benchmark Kospi index headed into bear market territory on Wednesday, a decline of 20% from a recent peak, after the country announced $1.3 billion in emergency support measures for its auto industry as it seeks to mitigate the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs. The index closed down 1.7%, falling about 20% from a peak reached in July 2024. Markets in Taiwan also fell sharply. The Shanghai stock market closed more than 1% higher, an outlier in a sea of red in Asia on Wednesday.\nIn Europe, the region\u2019s benchmark STOXX 600 index fell 3.5%. France\u2019s CAC index was down 3.34% and Germany\u2019s DAX was 3% lower. London\u2019s FTSE 100 index was 2.92% lower.\nUS oil reversed course and gained Wednesday after tumbling earlier in the day. US oil gained 4.65% to $62.35 a barrel after it had tumbled as low as $57 a barrel. The global benchmark Brent crude gained 4.23% to $65.48 a barrel, reversing course after it had briefly fallen below $60 a barrel. Both had hit their lowest level since 2021 before surging higher after Trump\u2019s announcement. Oil prices had plunged as investors feared a potential global recession could sap demand for travel, transportation and shipping \u2014 all of which require fuel.\nInvestors have poured money into some traditional safe-havens, such as gold. Gold spot prices rose more than 3%.\nBut, curiously, US Treasury yields have risen in recent days as investors have largely sold off bonds. The benchmark 10-year yield, which fell below 4% earlier in the week, is now above 4.3%. Bonds were volatile on Wednesday, with yields coming down slightly from their intraday high but settling above recent sessions. Bonds yields and prices trade in opposite directions.\nTypically, in times of crisis, investors pour money into longer-term bonds in hopes that the short-term market problems are solved in the long run. But the bond market, like the stock market, has been shaken by extreme volatility in recent days, and some investors are heading for the exits.\nTrump told reporters Wednesday he was watching volatility in the bond market in recent days, appearing to indicate that it was among the factors that led to his decision to institute a 90-day pause on some tariffs.\n\u201cI was watching the bond market. The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it\u2019s beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,\u201d he said.\nDeutsche Bank analysts on Wednesday said the mass exodus from Treasury bonds may signal weakening demand for US-backed assets \u2014 traditionally viewed as the gold standard for safety, because it has the backing of the US government.\nBut in a trade war, investors may be fearful that America could lose its special standing in the world \u2014 an opinion echoed by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in hisshareholder letterearlier this week. And foreign governments negotiating with Trump on trade may threaten to sell off their massive Treasury hoards, hurting America\u2019s ability to borrow money to pay for its significant budget deficit.\nThe US dollar index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against six foreign currencies, pared its losses after initially sliding on Wednesday. The dollar has broadly weakened this year \u2014 a potential warning sign about waning investor confidence in the United States.\nThe CBOE volatility index, also known as the \u201cVIX\u201d and Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d sank 35.75% after Trump\u2019s announcement of a pause on most reciprocal tariffs, reflecting easing jitters among traders.\nThe VIX Wednesday morning had briefly surpassed 50 points \u2014 a level associated with extreme volatility \u2014 before sinking in the afternoon to just above 33 points.\nThe index had closed above 50 on Tuesday, a level reached only twice before this week: During the early stages of the Covid pandemic in March and April 2020 and the 2008-2009 financial crisis that brought on the so-called Great Recession.\nThe VIX is perhaps the best-known measure of market sentiment. It measures expected price fluctuations or volatility in the S&P 500 Index options over the next 30 days. The VIX often surges on days when the broader market sinks \u2014 and rallies when stocks rise. But over time, the VIX tends to be lower in bull markets and higher when the bears are in control.\nVolatility works in both directions, and this week is a good example. The market bounced and tanked and surged as news \u2014 and even somefake news Monday\u2014 about Trump\u2019s potential plans for tariffs made its way through Wall Street.\nWhile Trump\u2019s announcement of a pause on most reciprocal tariffs was welcome news for investors, uncertainty lingers as a trade war with China looms.\n\u201cThe US and China are now locked into a trade war without either likely to back down at the moment,\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown told CNN. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in investors being extremely skittish which is why (there are) big fluctuations.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s DJ Judd, Kevin Liptak, Betsy Klein, Elisabeth Buchwald, James Frater and Christian Edwards contributed reporting","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/09\/investing\/global-stock-market-reciprocal-tariffs-hnk-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump is blaming Biden for a weakening economy. Is that fair?","date":"2025-03-18","body":"Markets are on thefritzand investor sentiment has slumped into\u201cextreme fear\u201dterritory. Consumer confidence readingshave crateredand surveys show a sharp turnabout in Americans\u2019 feelings about their future financial well-being. Any positive reports are described by economists as the\u201ccalm before the storm.\u201d\nThe common denominator is pure and utteruncertainty\u2014 particularly about just how President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping policy actions could shake out, economists say.\nHowever, when the topics of the economy, volatile markets, shaken confidence and sudden recession fears have been broached with Trump,he\u2019s hammered on familiar notes: That the Biden administration left him with an economic situation that was \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d a \u201cnightmare,\u201d \u201chorrible,\u201d or \u201cdamaged.\u201d\nStill, data aside, the economydidn\u2019t feel great to all Americanswho suffered through the highest inflation in decades, and those sour feelingshelped send Trump back to the White House for a second term.\nSuch claims have become a hair-pull for economists, statisticians, academics and fact-checkers alike: By most gold-standard measures, President Joe Biden handed Trumpa booming economy.And, if anything, the economy was ripe for a resurgence in early 2025 under Trump,economists have told CNN.\n\u201cThe economy was bad under Biden and that was reflected in the polls last year; but inflation and every other economic indicator had more or less stabilized when President Trump took office,\u201d Jai Kedia, an economist and research fellow at the Cato Institute, told CNN in an interview.\nWhat\u2019s happening now, Kedia said, is a tale as old as politics: The blame game.\nKedia, who\u2019s a Libertarian, is in the camp of politicians should \u201cleave things alone,\u201d when it comes to the economy.\n\u201cThis is true in the Biden administration with the massive spending bills and all of that, which in some part led to inflation; and that\u2019s true now with the tariffs that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Kedia said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to figure out why you would blame the previous administration. The stock market actually went up once Trump was elected, and it\u2019s only in the past month when the administration is playing around with dangerous economic ideas that you see the economy started to swivel back.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a direct result of the tariffs and other economic proposals,\u201d he said.\nThere are plenty of caveats when it comes to economic data: One month does not make a trend; figures are preliminary and often subject to revision as more detailed information becomes available; reports often represent a snapshot in time and can be influenced by one-off events such as weather; and, above all else, it takes time for situations to evolve and be fully understood.\n\u201cThis is a problem across our political spectrum of cherry-picking one month of employment or inflation reports to make general conclusions about the trend,\u201d Kedia said.\nTake, for example, Biden taking credit for \u201ccreating\u201d nearly 16 million jobs during his time in office; and then, most recently, Trump touting a slice of the February jobs report: a 10,000-job boost in manufacturing that he credited to his tariff-heavy trade policy and desires to make America a factory superpower.\nBoth claims have truthful elements to them, but there are important distinctions to be made: For Biden, he needed to clarify that it took roughly 9.5 million jobs of those to get back to pre-pandemic levels of employment; and for Trump, those gains are preliminary estimates and very well could be reflective of investments put forth under the Biden administration.\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too early to understand what the effects of the tariffs are on manufacturing and the rest of the economy,\u201d Kedia said. \u201cThe markets clearly are telling you where they think this is going.\u201d\nThis and other alarm bells are heightening recession fears.\n\u201cThis is not large enough to be a recessionary shock at this point; but it\u2019s going to cause growth to slow,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, RSM US principal and chief economist, said in an interview.\nBrusuelas\u2019 firm recently lifted its recession probability to 20% from 15%, or a one in five chance. If the current uncertainty evolves into a large trade shock that\u2019s sustained, RSM would revisit those projections, Brusuelas said.\n\u201cIf the shock is caused by a specific trade policy, it\u2019s highly likely that credit or blame \u2014 depending on your point of view regarding the recession \u2014 would fall squarely in the laps of the Trump administration,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the administration won\u2019t say it\u2019s Biden\u2019s fault. They\u2019ve already laid the predicate on that.\u201d\nTo be fair, confidence surveys aren\u2019t always reliable indicators of future economic performance, said Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University and chief economist at SS Economics.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an unprecedented amount of uncertainty, what I call a very thick fog, and we can\u2019t tell whether we\u2019re going north or south right now,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the fog clears up, the confidence will go up. So I would not use business confidence or consumer confidence as an indicator of how well or how poorly the economy is going to do going forward.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/18\/economy\/us-trump-blame-biden-economic-data","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s flailing on the economy is worse than Biden\u2019s","date":"2025-11-11","body":"President Donald Trump\u2019srecent commentary on the economy is drawing plenty of comparisons to then-President Joe Biden\u2019s.\nIn his most dismissive remarks on the topic to date, Trump ratcheted up his downplaying of Americans\u2019 affordability concerns in aFox News interviewon Monday. He even called them a \u201ccon job by Democrats\u201d and said the \u201cpolls are fake.\u201d\nFour years ago, Biden and his administration made a series of wayward predictions and comments about just how significant a problem inflation would prove to be. And they wound up paying a significant political price for their economic Pollyanna act.\nBut the situations aren\u2019t that analogous.\nIn fact, Trump has gone much further in his attempts to bury his head in the sand. And he seems to have a bigger problem politically speaking, for several reasons.\nNo, the economy isn\u2019t necessarily worse under Trump than it was under Biden. But Trump seems to have turned it into a bigger political liability.\nThe Biden administration\u2019s sins on this front were largely in its failure to recognize or convey how stubborn a problem inflation would be. Administration officials repeatedly and infamously used words like \u201ctransitory,\u201d suggesting the problem would soon go away.\n\u201cWe also know that as our economy\u202fhas come roaring back, we\u2019ve seen some price increases,\u201d Bidensaid in July 2021. \u201cSome folks have raised worries\u202fthat could be a sign of\u202fpersistent inflation.\u202fBut that\u2019s not our view.\u201d\nTheir view was wrong. The annual inflation rate climbed from about 5% when Biden made those remarks all the way over 9% about a year later. In the intervening months, the administration effectivelyacknowledged its error.\nTrump, by contrast, isn\u2019t just downplaying inflation or donning glasses that seem a couple of shades too rosy; he\u2019s pretending the problem simply doesn\u2019t exist.\nThat escalated Monday when he was pressed by Fox News\u2019 Laura Ingraham on whether Americans were right to be feeling the economic pinch. Trump basically suggested it was much ado about nothing.\n\u201cMore than anything else, it\u2019s a con job by the Democrats,\u201d he said.\nWhen Ingraham pointed to polls that show Americans are quite anxious about the economy, the president responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know that they are saying that. I think polls are fake.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Daniel Dale wrote a good rundown Monday of Trump\u2019snonstop string of liesabout this subject \u2013 lies that he repeated in the same Fox interview even as he accused others of misinformation. Trump has misstated a bevy of economic data points, including on inflation, grocery prices, energy prices and prescription drug prices. He keeps saying things like that there is no inflation or that grocery prices are down.\n(Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, claimed Monday when pressed by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins that Trump merely meantinflationwas down, rather than prices. But that\u2019s not what Trump has said. And as Dale notes, inflation is not down.)\nBiden\u2019s gamble was that his and his administration\u2019s predictions could turn out to be wrong, which they did.\nTrump\u2019s gamble is that if he can\u2019t convince people of his alternate version of reality, he risks looking completely out of touch.\nWhich brings us to the other major difference with Biden.\nThere is no question that inflation and the economy were political problems for the Democratic president; they likely helped deliver Trump the White House in 2024. But they appear to be even bigger political problems for Trump now.\nThat\u2019s because people are more likely to tie economic problems to Trump, specifically.\nA number of recent polls have shown this:\nAnd despite Trump\u2019s and his administration\u2019s attempts to blame Biden for continuing economic pains, polls suggest Americans aren\u2019t about to buy into that.\nAReuters-Ipsos pollas far back as May showed that if the country were to fall into a recession, 59% of Americans would blame Trump, versus just 37% who would blame Biden.\nSo why might Americans be more likely to attach economic pains to Trump than they did to Biden?\nThere are a number of possible reasons.\nOne is that Trumppledged over and over to bring prices down quickly, and he clearly hasn\u2019t done that.\nAnother is that Biden might have benefited from Americans blaming at least some of the economic problems on the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 which rocked the economy worldwide \u2013 rather than his policies.\nAnother could be that Trump voluntarily took ownership of an already dicey economy by launching tariffs very early in his second term.\nBut arguably the biggest reason is that Americans just haven\u2019t seen Trump take on this issue head-on. CBS polling shows as many 75% of Americans say the Trump administration has focused \u201cnot enough\u201d on lowering prices. That includes 57% of Republicans.\n(At least Biden was doing things like getting Congress to pass a bill called the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d \u2013 regardless of whether it actually helped with inflation.)\nOne way for Trump to respond to this data would be to double down on making affordability his focus. Another is to pretend 75% of Americans simply don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about or that the number is \u201cfake.\u201d\nTrump has apparently chosen the latter. It\u2019s difficult to see how those around him would see it as their best option.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/11\/11\/politics\/trump-economy-biden-analysis","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump endorses dramatic shift to the US economy","date":"2025-09-15","body":"In his latest bid to reshape the American economy, President Donald Trump has endorsed ending the decades-long practice of public companies sharing their financial results once each quarter.\nSuch a move would represent a dramatic shift aimed at combating short-term thinking inside C-Suites obsessed with pleasing investors but would also mean far less timely insights into the business world and the real economy.\nIn a Truth Socialpostthis morning, Trump said companies \u201cshould no longer be forced to \u2018Report\u2019 on a quarterly basis\u201d and should instead report results once every six months.\n\u201cThis will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDid you ever hear the statement that, \u2018China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???\u2019 Not good!!!!\u201d\nThe criticism of short-term thinking echoes argumentsmade by others in the past,including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and legendary investor Warren Buffett.\nHillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential election opponent,said in 2016she was \u201cdeeply distressed about quarterly capitalism.\u201d\nThe concern is that Corporate America is often far too focused on pleasing the notoriously fickle stock market and not paying enough attention to longer-term challenges and opportunities.\nMoreover, some argue that the regulatory burdens of quarterly reporting have contributed significantly to thesharp decline in the number of public companiesin the United States.\nTrump noted that moving away from quarterly reporting would be \u201csubject to SEC Approval,\u201d an allusion to the regulatory sign-off that would be required by regulators.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission may have a chance to weigh in on such a change soon enough.\nThe Long-Term Stock Exchange, an exchange backed by major investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund, plans to soon petition the SEC to eliminate the quarterly earnings report requirement and instead allow companies to report results once every six months.\n\u201cWe hear a lot about how it\u2019s overly burdensome to be a public company,\u201d the exchange\u2019s CEO Bill Harts told The Wall Street Journal, which first reported news of the planned petition. \u201cThis is an idea whose time has come.\u201d\nIn the 2010s, regulators in both the European Union and the United Kingdom stopped requiring companies to report quarterly results, moving to six-month reporting periods instead.\nIn 2018, Trumpurged the SECto study moving to a six-month reporting system to \u201callow greater flexibility & save money.\u201d\n\u201cWe believe the switch to semi-annual from quarterly reporting has moved from improbable to probable though not guaranteed,\u201d Jaret Seiberg, managing director at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\nSeiberg noted that there is an industry push to get rid of quarterly reporting and Paul Atkins, the Trump-nominated chair of the SEC, favors cutting red tape.\n\u201cThis appears to be an easy policy win for SEC Chair Paul Atkins to deliver to the President,\u201d Seiberg wrote.\nIt would likely take staffers at the SEC at least six months to craft a proposed rule and collect data to support it, Seiberg said.\nYet shareholders, economists, policymakers and others have come to rely on these timely updates from major companies.\nQuarterly reports from airlines give powerful insights into shifts in travel demand, big bank results give early warnings on loan losses and Big Tech reports currently give timely updates on the state of the artificial intelligence boom.\nMoving to a six-month reporting period could delay those insights and exaggerate stock moves during shifts in the economy and various industries.\nThis story has been updated with additional content.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/15\/economy\/trump-quarterly-reporting-sec-earnings","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"As Trump reignites a trade war and faces a bond market revolt, the economy is about to go through the wringer this week","date":"2025-05-27","body":"By week\u2019s end, it\u2019ll be much clearer how the US economy is holding up amid President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping policy changes.\nTrump\u2019s erratic trade war has alreadyunsettled consumersandtaken a toll on economic growth\u2014 mostly due to American businesses rushing to stock up on imports. And his \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d tax bill currently moving through Congress, which is expected to dramatically widen the country\u2019s deficit, has roiled the bond market.\nBut what matters for the underlying health of the broader economy is whether demand \u2014 for goods, services and homes \u2014 continues to chug along or fall off a cliff in the face of persistently elevated uncertainty, rising borrowing costs and higherprices.\nNew data due this week should give Wall Street and the Federal Reserve a better sense of the unfolding fallout of Trump\u2019s policies, including two new consumer surveys, a revised estimate of economic growth in the first quarter and fresh figures on consumer spending. Market observers will also get some clues on what it all means for the Fed, with several officials slated to give public remarks throughout the week.\nLast week, Trump reignited trade tensions by threateninga 50% tariff on the European Unionanda 25% duty on Apple and other smartphone makerslike Samsung. (He delayed the EU tariffs on Sunday.) The US House of Representatives alsopassed Trump\u2019s tax bill, sending it to the Senate, which is expected to make some changes.\nFresh figures this week will show how Americans have been feeling recently, known as soft data, and how consumers and businesses have been spending, referred to as hard data.\nOn Tuesday, the Conference Board releases its consumer survey for May, a closely watched measure of people\u2019s attitudes toward the economy. In April, consumer confidencetumbled 7.9 points to a reading of 86, the business group said, the lowest level since May 2020. Economists polled by data firm FactSet project consumer confidence to have improved slightly this month.\nThen later on Friday, the University of Michigan releases a revised version of its consumer survey for May. A preliminary reading released earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment sank in May to the second-lowest level on records going back to 1952.\nOn Thursday, the Commerce Department releases its second estimate of gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, for the first quarter. An initial estimate showed that GDP declined at an annualized rate of 0.3% in the first three months of the year, the worst quarter since 2022, driven by a higher trade deficit as Americans rushed to beat Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nOn Friday, the department also releases April data on household spending, income and the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge. In March, consumer spending soared 0.7% as Americans pulled forward their purchases, particularly of cars, to avoid the sticker shock from Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nPersistently elevated mortgage rates, concerns over the economy, volatility in financial markets and home prices that continue to climb are clouding the outlook for America\u2019s housing market.\nThat\u2019s led to anunderwhelming spring home shopping season so far.New data this week will show if buyers will get squeezed even more.\nOn Tuesday, S&P Global releases its S&P Global CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index for March. Home-price growth in February continued to climb, rising at an annual pace of 3.9%, as lingering housing shortages continued to push up prices.\nOn Thursday, the National Association of Realtors reports home sales based on contract signings in April. Pending home sales surged 6.1% in March from the prior month, the strongest monthly gain since December 2023, which NAR\u2019s chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said was \u201cfueled by ongoing job growth.\u201d\nThat same day, Freddie Mac reports on the average rate of a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage in the week ending May 29. Mortgage rates last week averaged 6.86%, the highest level since mid-February, as bond investorsfretted over what Trump\u2019s tax bill means for the national debt.\nDemand for bonds dropped last week, which cratered prices and sent yields rising. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which largely influences mortgage rates, went above 4.61% last week, as the 30-year eclipsed 5.14%, its highest level since October 2023.\nMarket observers regularly pore over Fed officials\u2019 latest public comments and minutes from their latest policy meeting because they give a clue on what to expect for interest rates in the coming months.\nSo far, Fed officials have signaled in their recent speeches that they prefer to stand pat as they wait for further clarity on Trump\u2019s policies and how the US economy is responding to the administration\u2019s massive changes. The job market\u2019s resilience has also allowed the Fed to stay on hold, since it means the central bank doesn\u2019t need to provide any urgent relief through a rate cut.\nHere are some of this week\u2019s notable Fed events:","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/27\/business\/economy-trump-tariffs-data","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"As tariffs darken the economic outlook, Trump sizes up Powell as a scapegoat","date":"2025-04-18","body":"Donald Trump is showing why independent central banks are a good idea.\nThe president\u2019s double tirade against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday conjured another dark cloud over financial markets and an economy repeatedly traumatized by his tariff and trade-war chaos.\n\u201cIf I want him out, he\u2019ll be out of there real fast, believe me,\u201dTrump told reportersin the Oval Office. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with him.\u201d\nTrump is furious that Powell has ignored his frequent demands for a swift lowering of interest rates that would potentially make it easier for Americans to borrow to buy homes and could improve consumer sentiment and boost stocks. The Fed made three consecutive rate cuts last year after bringing inflation nearly to target. But it has paused the strategy amid concerns over growing economic uncertainty, which have been exacerbated by Trump\u2019s volatile leadership since taking office less than three months ago.\nOn Thursday morning, a short-tempered Trump appeared incensed over Powell\u2019s warning a day earlier that the tariffs would likely cause inflation and higher unemployment and that some of their burden \u201cwould be paid by the public.\u201d\nPowell\u2019s speechto the Economic Club of Chicago was the clearest statement yet by a key financial official about the potential impact of Trump\u2019s policies. He was stating what almost every serious economist believes about the impact of tariffs. But his comments conflicted with the president\u2019s quixotic belief in the almost mystical power of taxing imports and his insistence that such a strategy will not spike prices and pass higher costs on to consumers.\nThe context of Trump\u2019s attack on Powell Thursday is also important.\nIt came amid an angry defense of his economic management, in which he blamed President Joe Biden multiple times \u2013 even though the economy was humming when the Oval Office changed hands \u2013 before he turned on the Fed chief. The president\u2019s tetchy mood left a very strong impression that he was seeking out scapegoats in case his trade war strategy fails and he can\u2019t secure deals with nations he\u2019s targeted with tariffs.\n\u201cIf things continue to go down and a deal is not made, he\u2019s going to blame the downturn in the market on Jay Powell and say that it was because he didn\u2019t cut the rates,\u201d Wall Street trader Peter Tuchman told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on Thursday.\nThe president did nothing to dispel the impression that his criticism of Powell was designed to trigger interest rate cuts that would help his own political priorities and prospects. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have a lot of political pressure. You know \u2026 I think there\u2019s a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates,\u201d Trump said.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, is a frequent critic of Powell. But she argued on CNBC that it is important that the Fed chair stay in his post. \u201cI have tangled with him on a regular basis about both regulations and interest rates but understand this: If Chairman Powell can be fired by the president of the United States, it will crash markets in the United States,\u201d Warren said.\nThe Massachusetts senator, a former Harvard Law professor, argued that the strength of the US financial system relies on the idea that \u201cthe big pieces move independent of the politics.\u201d She added: \u201cIf interest rates in the US are subject to a president who just wants to wave his magic wand, this doesn\u2019t distinguish us from any two other two-bit dictatorship around the world where everyone knows that your big investment risk is: Will that dictator will wake up in the morning and have a tummy ache and decide to cause this problem or favor that friend?\u201d\nTrump\u2019s anger at Powell was exacerbated because the European Central Bankjust cut ratesfor the seventh time in a year, causing him to ask why the Federal Reserve is not being similarly aggressive. \u201cHe\u2019s too late \u2014 always too late. A little slow. And I\u2019m not happy with him. I let him know it,\u201d the president said. Previously, in an early morning post on his Truth Social network, Trump raised expectations that he could fire Powell by saying his \u201ctermination cannot come soon enough.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s attacks, however, belie Powell\u2019s record. His stewardship of the economy has been steady through a tumultuous period that included the Covid-19 pandemic and its subsequent financial crisis. And he steered inflation down from above 9% to its current rate of 2.4% without triggering widespread unemployment in a soft landing that many analysts did not believe was possible.\nPowell became Fed chair in 2018 after he was nominated by Trump. He was reappointed by President Joe Biden in 2022. His current term ends in May 2026.\nThe Federal Reserve was set up by Congress in 1913 as an independent body to insulate it from the kind of political pressure that the president is imposing. Its mission is to secure stable prices and employment \u2013 a mission that sometimes puts it at odds with the short-term needs of lawmakers and presidents.\nIf Trump were to acquire the power to manipulate interest rates at will \u2013 through a proxy Fed chair or otherwise \u2013 he\u2019d spark confusion on the financial markets, buckle confidence in the US economy and almost certainly spike inflation. And it would be a further sign that America\u2019s global reputation as a rock of financial stability is quickly eroding in his second term.\nPotential market turmoil \u2013 following wild drops and swings in share prices since Trump launched his tariff war this month \u2013 may be one factor in persuading Trump to leave Powell in place. The Wall Street Journalreported on Thursdaythat the president has talked about firing Powell but that senior officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have so far talked him out of it.\nIt is generally accepted in Washington that the president lacks the power to dismiss board members overseeing independent agencies without cause. But the administration ishoping the Supreme Court will overturna 1935 legal precedent on which such assumptions are based.\nTrump\u2019s growing contempt for sound governance and the courts \u2013 and his constant efforts to expand presidential power on questionable terms \u2013 mean that Powell\u2019s future is not certain. This is a White House that acts first and deals with the consequences of potential illegality later.\nBut there\u2019s a chance the president is just venting. After all, he repeatedly complained about Powell\u2019s caution during his first term. Forbes reported last year that he ordered Wilbur Ross to call the Fed chief and order him to lower rates, citing the former Commerce secretary\u2019s memoir.\nBut Trump has also never been so unconstrained. In his new administration, he\u2019s picked officials who are loath to temper his wildest instincts. Bessent is seen as a moderating influence. Earlier this week, he told Bloomberg that \u201cmonetary policy is a jewel box that\u2019s got to be preserved.\u201d But the Treasury secretary lacks significant political experience. And history shows that any subordinate who seeks to rein in the president could soon find themselves fired.\nNew uncertainty over Powell\u2019s future comes with the economy reeling from successive shocks over Trump\u2019s tariff policy \u2013 especially the 145% duties imposed on Chinese imports. The impact of this hardline approach could soon hit in the form of high prices and shortages of key consumer goods and other items. While Trump has frozen reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries and says multiple governments are offering trade deals, it remains unclear whether he\u2019ll be able to deliver on his goal of bringing back manufacturing and jobs in the short term.\nConsumer confidence hasmeanwhile been tumbling, and companies are struggling to set expectations and budgets for the year ahead, raising more fears that the economy could soon slip into recession.\nEven if Trump doesn\u2019t try to dismiss Powell, but simply continues to talk about doing so, he could rattle investor confidence.\nThis is why most presidents understand interest rate policy \u2013 as infuriating as it may often be \u2013 is best left to the independent Fed.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/18\/politics\/powell-trump-federal-reserve-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

While the president is considering reigniting his trade war, investors say markets are taking it with a grain of salt.\n\u201cMarkets have broadly shrugged off the tariff news overnight,\u201d Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, said. \u201cEssentially, the door remains open for individual economies to whittle down proposed tariffs through negotiations.\u201d\n\u201cInvestors are taking the glass-half-full view at the moment, enjoying the reprieve from the deadline extension, rather than focus on the reiteration of the potential tariff levels should negotiations fall through,\u201d he added.\nThe new tariff announcements are a \u201cspeed bump\u201d as opposed to something that would \u201cderail\u201d the momentum in stocks, according to Mohit Kumar, chief strategist and economist for Europe at Jefferies.\n\u201cSingling out certain countries for higher tariffs is a way of putting pressure on these and other countries to agree to a deal sooner rather than later,\u201d Kumar said.\nTrump so far has only announced frameworks for trade deals with theUnited Kingdom,ChinaandVietnam. Peter Navarro, White House senior counsel for trade, had said in April the administration would pursue \u201c90 deals in 90 days.\u201d\nTrump on Monday sent letters to 14 countries outlining proposed tariff rates.

It\u2019s a verytricky scenariofor central banks to navigate: raising interest rates to rein in inflation risks stifling growth and pushing up unemployment, but cutting interest rates to juice the economy could stoke inflation.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chance that (we\u2019ll) have stagflation (in the US),\u201dDimon told Bloomberg Television in Shanghai, China, Thursday. The billionaire stressed that he was not making a prediction but that \u201cwe have to be prepared for something like that.\u201d\n\u201cGlobal fiscal deficits are inflationary.

{"title":"Trump routinely calls economic data \u2018fake.\u2019 Here\u2019s why that\u2019s dangerous","date":"2025-01-26","body":"Federal economic data is one of the purest forms of infrastructure, says Erica Groshen, a former commissioner atthe Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\u201cThese data keep our economy running as much as roads and bridges do,\u201d she said.\nPolicymakers, businesses, organizations and other entities rely heavily on the vast trove of detailed data and long-running statistical trends to make investments and decisions \u2014 actions that ultimately affect people\u2019s livelihoods.\nBut that statistical infrastructure \u2014 which alreadyhas been in a precarious statein terms of funding, response rates and public trust \u2014 is now at greater risk of crumbling, warn Groshen and others.\nIt remains to be seen how federal statistical agencies may fare under President Donald Trump, who has criticized economic data and seeks to rollback government programs; as well as in theage of DOGE, when the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency aims to streamline large swaths of the government.\nConcernsabout potential cuts or changes to data \u2014 which world leaders, regulators, economists and executives have relied upon for decades \u2014 come at a time when statisticians inside and outside of the government have clamored for funding to better modernize how the critical data is collected, tabulated and disseminated.\nOther researchers have told CNNthat their fears are amplified(and, in some cases,realized) as to how surveys and economic data could be affected by an administration that not onlyquestioned the legitimacyof economic figures in recent months, but also is activelyshutting down some federal programs and websitesthat provide resources to underserved communities.\nFederal data is considered the \u201cgold standard,\u201d because of its longstanding reliability, quality, comprehensiveness, transparency and history, to name a few.\nIt\u2019s also at a crossroads.\nSurveying people \u2014 one of the tried-and-true means of obtaining information \u2014 is in trouble, said William Beach, who served as BLS commissioner during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\u201cSurveys are dying,\u201d Beach told CNN. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a cold, it\u2019s a terminal disease.\u201d\nPeople are tired of taking surveys, Beach said, especially via the means the government relies upon: in-person and over the phone.Response rates have plummetedin recent years for a variety of surveys that serve as the backbone for some of the most important economic data.\n\u201cWith lower response rates, our estimates are going to be more volatile, and our benchmark revisions (which typically factor in hard data sources such as tax records) are going to be greater,\u201d Beach said.\nAnd that volatility opens the door to criticism, he said.\nRelated articleNew data shows US job growth has been far weaker than initially reported\n\u201cWith the larger revisions and the statistical system kind of on its heels, people are taking pot shots at the data,\u201d Beach said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate that they\u2019re doing it, and it\u2019s being done left and right. It\u2019s not a Republican or Democrat thing. It\u2019s just politicians finding good targets.\u201d\nOne of the most prominent examples of thiscame in August 2024, when the BLS released its preliminary benchmark revisions of employment data for the 12 months ended in March 2024. The initial estimated downward revision of 818,000 was larger than seen in the past 15 years, which spurred Trump to post that the jobs data was a \u201clie\u201d and that the Biden administration \u201chas been caught fraudulently manipulating job statistics.\u201d\nThe revision process happens every year \u2014 and did so under Trump \u2014 and economists noted that the larger revision (which was a tiny fraction of overall employment) was due to ongoing effects from the pandemic and the subsequent immigration surge.\n\u201cTrust is mission-critical to the statistical agencies,\u201d Groshen said. \u201cIf you build a bridge but nobody trusts it, they don\u2019t drive over it.\u201d\nIn addition to lower response rates, statistical agencies have been facing the long-term trend of declining funding, Groshen said.\nIn turn, the agency has become more efficient, she said; but that hasn\u2019t come without trade-offs.\n\u201cIt has had to reduce some of the bandwidth that it used for contingency, resilience and modernization, because it needs to maintain the flow of the data that users depend on,\u201d she said.\nThe Census Bureau has beenworking to modernizethe Current Population Survey, which is one of two major surveys that compose the monthly jobs report and which serves as the source for the national unemployment rate. But it\u2019s also had steadily declining response rates, due to issues such as privacy concerns, cellphone-only households and respondents\u2019 availability.\nThe aim would be to add an online-based response component.\n\u201cTo make a change like this, you have to really test it, and it\u2019s a slow, exacting process that maintains this continuity of this information over time,\u201d she said. \u201cBLS and the Census Bureau have been asking for that to be funded for five years, and it hasn\u2019t been funded.\u201d\nSome of the stated plans to streamline the government present a \u201chuge\u201d risk to federal data, because the statistical agencies fall into under discretionary funding, she said.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to take a big whack at the budget, pretty much all discretionary spending would have to go, and that would include the statistical agencies,\u201d she said.\nAnd that would be the opposite of the desired effect, she said.\n\u201cIf you want government to be efficient, how are you going to get it to be efficient if you can\u2019t measure anything; if you can\u2019t measure cause and effect; if you can\u2019t measure economic conditions so that you can target where problems are?\u201d she said. \u201cIf companies and governments that are making decisions have less information or worse information, their decisions are going to be worse. The economy will be less efficient.Investors won\u2019t have as good information on where to invest their money.\u201d\nStill, Groshen said, she believes there is common ground in some of the proposals floated inProject 2025, the controversial playbook for a reimagined federal government published by conservatives at the Heritage Foundation in advance of a second Trump term. The chapter on the Commerce Department included a suggestion ofconsolidating somestatistical agencies.\n\u201cI think [the consolidation] ideahas some merit done the right way, it could be very good for the statistical agencies,\u201d said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put them under a cabinet secretary. I would put them in an independent agency headed up by the chief statistician of the US, and I would make sure their funding was secure.\u201d\nWhen money is short, there also could be opportunities to explore partnerships with universities on running certain surveys and programs or cutting back others, Beach said.\nRelated articleThese millions of Americans are more likely to live in poverty, be unemployed and have no family support\nThere are some backstops in place.\nSeveral organizations, grassroots and otherwise, actively crawl and archive government websites \u2014 especially during times of administration changes.\nOne of those is the End of Term Web Archive project, which has been active since 2008. The organization aims to collect and preserve the information disseminated on the government and military domains at the end of presidential terms.\nTheEnd of Term Web Archivetakes nominations for URLs to be archived, or as the organization calls it, \u201cseeds\u201d for the web crawlers.\n\u201cI\u2019ve checked our reports, and all of those [economic data] agencies\u2019 sites have been nominated,\u201d James Jacobs, US government information librarian at Stanford University and EOT participant, wrote in an email response to CNN.\nNoting that economic data is often collected based on legislative requirements, Jacobs said organizations such as theCensus Projectand theAssociation of Public Data Usersactively track and advocate for government data at the Congressional level.\nThe extent to which data may be scaled back or information removed could have chilling effects for underserved communities, according to areport released last weekby the UCLA School of Law\u2019s Williams Institute, which conducts research on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy.\nTrump\u2019s executive orders that redefined \u201csex\u201d as only male and female and that eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion-focused efforts could ultimatelyaffect the federal data involving marginalized Americans, including thosewithin the LGBTQ+ community.\n\u201cThis creates a lack of being able to understand what\u2019s going on with a very vulnerable population,\u201d said Christy Mallory, the Williams Institute\u2019s interim executive director and legal director. \u201cIn order to address some larger economic issues and employment issues, we need to know what\u2019s going on with sub-populations of people.

{"title":"Inflation slowed more than expected in April, despite tariff-related price pressures building","date":"2025-05-13","body":"US inflation slowed to its lowest rate in more than four years, an unexpected and welcome development at a time when President Donald Trump\u2019sdramatically escalated tariffsare expected to cause prices to rise.\nConsumer prices rose 0.2% last month, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.3%, an unexpectedly cooler reading than the2.4% increase seen in March, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nIt\u2019s the lowest annual rate since February 2021, and the April data was slightly better than expected. Economists expected that the CPI would rise 0.3% from March and hold steady at 2.4% for the 12 months ended i\ufeffn April, according to FactSet.\nHowever, what\u2019s been a yearslong unwinding of post-pandemic inflation also isn\u2019t expected to last.\n\u201cOn its face, the numbers in the CPI report are good news for consumers: food prices being down, some air travel being slightly cheaper, things that people like to see in the economy,\u201d said Tyler Schipper, associate professor in economics and data analysis at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. \u201cThose tariffs are still out there, they\u2019re still at levels that we have not seen in a very long time, and there are some good explanations for why we shouldn\u2019t necessarily be seeing price increases yet.\u201d\nAmong those reasons: There have been significant shifts in tariff policy, and some of the most aggressive duties were curtailed or paused; businesses front-loaded purchases, building up their pre-tariff inventory; and some costs from the initial waves of new tariffs might have been absorbed by retailers and manufacturers.\nAnd as far as the inflation data is concerned, any tariff effects would likely first emerge in goods (where some categories did show price jumps); however, any increases there were offset by softer services inflation, including areas where weaker consumer demand might have weighed down prices.\n\u201cThis may be the low point (for CPI) in 2025,\u201d Ben Ayers, Nationwide senior economist, wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday. \u201cAs tariff costs increasingly flow into consumer prices, we expect a jump in the CPI this summer, pushing the annual reading back above 3%. Correspondingly, economic growth should be soft over the rest of the year as higher prices and economic concerns weigh on spending activity.\u201d\nAnd while tariff-related impacts were scant in Tuesday\u2019s CPI data, not only were there some indications that price pressures may be building, but the report also showed signs of how massive economic uncertainty has weighed on consumers.\nConsumers got some relief at the grocery store, where prices fell 0.4% from March, and that brought down overall food prices by 0.1%.\nEgg prices sank 12.7% for the month,reflecting declines seen on the wholesale sideas the industry starts to recover from a deadly bout of avian flu. The average price of a dozen Grade A eggs fell from $6.23 to $5.12, BLS data shows.\nAnnually, egg prices are up 49.3%.\n\u201cMaybe the worst of EggGate has passed,\u201d Schipper told CNN Business.\nFood and energy (which rose 0.7% from March) are two of the areas where consumers most frequently encounter inflation; however, they\u2019re also the most volatile and affected by temporary events such as weather, war, disease, supply chain snarls, and demand swings.\nThe Core CPI gauge, which strips out food and energy, rose 0.2% from March and remained at an annual rate of 2.8%, according to Tuesday\u2019s report.\nStill, the report also showed the \u201cfirst clear evidence of upward pressure\u201d on goods prices from tariffs, noted Samuel Tombs, chief US economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics.\nPrices for goods excluding food, energy and autos rose 0.2%, exceeding the past 12 months\u2019 zero average, he wrote in a note to investors. Household furnishings and appliances leapt by 1%, and computer and telephone prices rose by 0.3%, a turnabout from a 0.6% average drop during the previous 12 months, he added.\nAdditionally, well-documented plunges in consumer confidence weighed on discretionary services prices last month, particularly for air transportation, which fell 2.8% in April after registering drops of 5.3% and 4% in March and February, respectively.\n\u201cThe very low level on searches of Google for phrases including \u2018flights\u2019 in April \u2026 suggests that booking and prices will remain subdued in May,\u201d he wrote.\nEconomists anticipate that tariffs likely will make a bigger splash on physical and virtual store shelves in May and June. However, data set to be released later this week could give a glimpse as to what, if anything, could be coming down the pike.\nOn Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the Producer Price Index for April, providing a look at wholesale-level inflation.\nEconomistsexpect the PPI datato continue to mirror the cooling trend seen in the CPI; however, despite inflation\u2019s favorable downward trajectory, it might not result in lower interest rates in the near term, economists say.\nThe Federal Reserve bases its 2% inflation target using a different measure (the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index,which measured 2.3% in March) buthas opted to take a cautious approachto monetary policy, especially in the wake of Trump\u2019s sweeping moves on trade, immigration and federal employment and spending.\nFed policymakers are \u201cwaiting to see the impact of tariffs on inflation and the labor market before adjusting their key short-term policy rate, the federal funds rate,\u201d Gus Faucher, PNC Financial Services chief economist, wrote in a note on Tuesday. \u201cPNC expects tariffs to result in slower economic growth and a softer labor market over the next few months.\u201d\nThatcould force the Fed\u2019s hand.\n\u201cEven as inflation reaccelerates in the near term, the central bank will be more concerned about the labor market,\u201d Faucher said, adding that PNC is forecasting that the Fed would make four, quarter-point cuts in the second half of 2025.\nThis story has been updated.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/13\/economy\/us-cpi-consumer-inflation-april","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"US wholesale inflation heated up in May","date":"2025-06-12","body":"US wholesale inflation rose slightly in May, driven in part by costlier goods; however, tariff-related effects were largely muted.\nThe latest Producer Price Index, a closely watched measurement of wholesale inflation, showed that prices paid to producers rose 0.1% in May, lifting the annual rate to 2.6%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday.\nEconomists were expecting that prices would rise 0.2% from April and 2.6% for the 12 months ended in May.\nEconomists warn, however, that President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs are expected to eventually result in some price increases for consumers.\nThe upswing marked a turnabout from a 0.2% drop in April, which was driven largely bywholesalers and retailers\u2019 margins being squeezed, which economists attributed to higher tariffs.\nRevisions to April\u2019s PPI data showed that margins weren\u2019t eaten up as much as previously thought: The initially reported 1.7% plunge in the trade services category was revised to a 0.5% drop. In May, trade services posted an increase of 0.4%, according to the report.\nGoods-related inflation picked up for the month, rising 0.2%, while services inched higher by 0.1%.\n\u201cThe softer headline gain for the PPI in May hides much of the underlying cost pressures faced by producers,\u201d Ben Ayers, Nationwide senior economist, wrote in a note to investors on Thursday. \u201cTariff impacts are steadily flowing into prices for inputs, especially for metals, which is raising production costs for machinery and vehicles.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cBut a wave of tariff-induced cost spikes remains missing from the data, further muting and extending the expected price increases for consumers tied to trade disruptions.\u201d\nPPI serves as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead.\nExcluding food and energy, which are categories that typically have more volatility, core PPI rose slightly as well, increasing 0.1% from April. On an annual basis, core PPI inflation eased slightly to 3% from 3.1%.\nOn Wednesday, thelatest Consumer Price Index datashowed that overall inflation rose less than expected for goods and services commonly purchased by Americans.\nDuring the past year, the overall PPI was heavily influenced by swings \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 in food and energy. Both categories in May, however, were tame, as foods rose by 0.1% and energy prices were unchanged.\nAbout 80% of the increase seen in goods prices last month came from areas other than food and energy. Economists have recently indicated that the price pressures from tariffs would show up first in \u201ccore goods\u201d (goods that exclude food and energy).\nThe prices producers received for durable consumer goods shot 0.4% higher in May, logging the largest monthly increase that category has seen since January 2023, BLS data shows.\nHowever, monthly data can be volatile, and economic data is frequently revised as more comprehensive information becomes available, something that was fully on display between April and May PPI reports, said Tyler Schipper, associate professor in economics and data analytics at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\u201cA lot of the upstream potential tariff pressures that economists had identified were not present in the May numbers and were, in many cases, revised downwards,\u201d he told CNN in an interview.\n\u201cThere might have been some changes in what producers were selling for in April that changed in May, because policies were turned on or off; but I think we are in danger of over-interpreting the data when we do that again,\u201d he added.\nIt\u2019s expected that it will take more time to determine the extent to which these trade policy shifts will affect prices and whether they result in more than a short-term bump in inflation. What is clearer, however, is that the Federal Reserve is being put \u201cin a really hard position,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think they still have some time where they don\u2019t have to come riding to the rescue,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my best guess is that next week and even later this summer, they will continue to hold off (cutting rates) until early in the fall.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/12\/economy\/us-producer-price-index-ppi-inflation-may","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

A 0.4% monthly decline and a 2.7% annual rate were revised up to 0% and 3.4%, respectively.\nEconomists were expecting monthly prices to rise in April by 0.2% and to slow to 2.4% on an annual basis, according to FactSet.\nA driving force behind the downward monthly swing was a 1.7% plunge in trade services, a category that measures gross margins for wholesalers and retailers.\nAlthough it\u2019s a volatile category, the sharp downward swing in trade services indicates that companies\u2019 margins are being eaten away by higher costs from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN on Thursday.\n\u201cWe are beginning to see the impact of trade policy filtering into the hard data in such a way that it\u2019s impossible to deny that it is now affecting revenues and profit margins for firms,\u201d Brusuelas said.\nThose higher costs will likely start spilling over to consumers soon, he said.\nAnd the economy-powering consumers are already showing some signs of fatigue:Sales at US retailers slowed sharply in Aprilto 0.1% after a surge of 1.7% in March, when shoppers rushed to beat the slew of new tariffs.\nSeparately on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that \u201csupply shocks\u201d could force the central bank to keep rates higher over the long term.\n\u201cWe may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks \u2014 a difficult challenge for the economy and for central banks,\u201d Powell said.\nHe noted that \u201cinflation could be more volatile going forward than in the inter-crisis period of the 2010s.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the latest Consumer Price Index data showed thatoverall inflation cooled furtherfor the goods and services Americans commonly purchase.

After posting a 0.1% increase in December, that category rose 0.2% in January, 0.3% in February and March, and 0.4% in April, Rupkey noted.\nThe 0.4% increase is the fastest monthly inflation for that category in more than two years, BLS data shows.\n\u201cIt looks like some of the fears of what is going to happen from these import tariffs is becoming a reality, and that is goods prices going up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a worrisome sign for inflation down the road, meaning it could be only a couple of months away.\u201d\nAnd on Thursday, the world\u2019s largest retailer said as much: Walmart\u2019s chief executive officer told investors and analysts that Trump\u2019s tariffs are \u201ctoo high,\u201d and that the companywill start raising prices at its stores later this month.\n\u201cWe will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday on an earnings call. \u201cBut, given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren\u2019t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.\u201d\n\u201cThe higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\u201d he said.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and information.\nCNN\u2019s Elisabeth Buchwald and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/15\/economy\/us-ppi-inflation-april","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

However, a closely watched measurement of underlying inflation trends indicated some progress in the fight to rein in price hikes.\nThe Personal Consumption Expenditures price index rose 2.6% in December from the year before, heating upfrom November\u2019s 2.4% increase, according to new Commerce Department data released Friday.\nOn a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3% as compared to 0.1% in November.\nThat acceleration was in line with economists\u2019 expectations, which called for a 0.3% increase from November and a 2.6% annual gain, according to FactSet consensus estimates.\nThe core PCE price index, which excludes the more volatile components of gas and food, hit expectations on the nose: It rose 0.2% from November and the annual rate of underlying inflation held pat at 2.8% for the third month in a row, according to the report.\nInflation has cooled substantially since peaking in the summer of 2022, and that progress continued through 2024 to the point where an elusive \u201csoft landing\u201d\u2014 price stability without having the economy tank into a recession \u2014 remained achievable as Joe Biden wrapped up his presidency.\nThe PCE price index is part of the Commerce Department\u2019s monthly Personal Income and Outlays report, which includes comprehensive data on how Americans earn, spend and save.\nAnd in December, they ramped up their spending significantly.\nConsumer spending shot up 0.7% from November, exceeding economists\u2019 expectations for a 0.5% gain.\nWith Thanksgiving landing late in November, the holiday shopping season waslargely concentrated in December; also, the increase likely reflected some replacement purchases of cars, furniture and other goods damaged by the two major hurricanes that hit in October 2024, Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN Friday.\nRelated articleEverything you need to know about Trump\u2019s tariffs but were afraid to ask\nAnother likely factor is that consumers also were buying more durable goodsin anticipation of tariffsthat have been threatened by President Donald Trump, Samuel Tombs, Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 chief US economist, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\nPurchases of TVs, technology products and autos have notably surged, he noted.\nTrump on Thursday reiterated plans to slap a 25% tariff on imports from both Canada and Mexico.\n\u201cConsumers shop with an eye on bargains, and 25% tariffs of the imports of America\u2019s two largest trading partners could force prices of store-bought goods well beyond the reach of many if not all consumers,\u201d economist Chris Rupkey of FwdBonds wrote in commentary on Friday. \u201cThere may not be another full-blown cost of living crisis, but the future with tariffs certainly looks less affordable for all Americans.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not sure the country is willing to pay the price for the new administration\u2019s social goals of stopping migrants and illicit drugs at the border,\u201d he added.\nThe sheer rate of spending does not appear to be sustainable, Pantheon\u2019s Tombs noted.\nHouseholds\u2019 personal saving rate \u2014 savings as a percentage after tax \u2014 was the lowest in two years, Commerce Department data shows. The saving rate dropped to 3.8% from 4.1% in November, according to Friday\u2019s report.\n\u201cIt now is 2 percentage points below its 2015-to-19 average,\u201d Tombs said.\nConsumers also are leaning more on their credit cards. The share of people making just the minimum payment on their credit cards hit a 12-year high, according to third-quarter 2024data released last weekby the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an orange flag,\u201d EY-Parthenon\u2019s Daco told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re noticing that there is a bifurcation in the consumer outlook in that the consumers at the lower-to-medium end of the income spectrum are spending more judiciously in a high-price, high-interest-rate environment.\u201d\nThe strong momentum seen in the consumer spending data has largely been driven by higher income individuals, he said.\nOverall, personal income grew 0.4% in December, marking a slight acceleration from the 0.3% gain seen the month before, according to Friday\u2019s report.\n\u201cThe monthly numbers add some more light on the income side of the economy,\u201d Eugenio Alem\u00e1n, chief economist at Raymond James, wrote Friday. \u201cThis showed that consumers are deploying their savings to \u2018keep up with the Joneses,\u2019 which could become a problem down the line.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s release marked the final inflation report for 2024, and while the last chapter showed a \u201cbump in the road\u201d during the fourth quarter, the underlying fundamentals remain disinflationary, Daco said.\nThat story should continue through the first couple of months of this year, he said, noting disinflationary dynamics like cautious consumer spending, constrained pricing power, strong productivity growth, easing shelter cost inflation, slowing insurance-related inflation and cooling wage growth. (Separately, on Friday, theBureau of Labor Statistics reportedthat workers\u2019 compensation grew 3.8% for the year ended in December, slowing from a 3.9% rate notched in September.)\nHowever, he added, the inflationary risks are much higher than they were before the election, he added.\n\u201cAs we look further out, then you might start to see the pressures from some of the policies that are put in place \u2014 immigration restrictions; perhaps even some deregulation; and tariffs, of course, are big, big unknowns,\u201d he said. \u201cBut their effect on the economy is likely to take a bit more time.\u201d\nThe path to the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target was expected to be long and bumpy, and it has been a little choppy the past couple of months, prompting the central bankto take a more cautious approachto rate cuts in 2025.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that inflation remains elevated; but the labor market is solid, and the economy is strong, so the central bankdoesn\u2019t have to hurrymore rate cuts. He also indicated policymakers are taking a wait-and-see approach as some of Trump\u2019s sweeping policy moves come to fruition.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/31\/economy\/us-pce-inflation-consumer-spending-december","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The Dow was up by almost 700 points in morning trading, while the S&P rose by 1.69% and the Nasdaq Composite was higher by 2%.\nThe CPI measures price changes across commonly purchased goods and services\nOverall, the CPI did increase more than anticipated,rising 0.4% from Novemberand jumping 0.2 percentage points to annual rate of 2.9%. However, the monthly gain was largely driven by gas and food prices.\nEnergy prices, particularly gas and fuel costs, accounted for 40% of the overall monthly increase. Food prices also remained elevated as key staples such as meat and eggs continued to face pressures from weather and disease, respectively.\nFood and gas are two of the most visible and frequent ways that consumers encounter inflation. And when prices go up in areas where people \u2014 especially lower-income Americans \u2014 spend most of their monthly budget,it\u2019s a disheartening endeavor.\nIn the context of inflation measures, energy and food are two of the most volatile categories and can exhibit wild swings because of factors considered one-time in nature.\nRelated articleFood prices are on the rise again. What\u2019s behind the increase\nExcluding energy and food, the closely watched core CPI gauge slowed for the first time in months, rising just 0.2% from November and easing to 3.2% after staying stuck at 3.3% since September 2024.\n\u201cMarkets reacted positively this morning for a good reason: the Federal Reserve is OK with watching the headline CPI go up temporarily if that increase does not spill over into the core CPI, and this is what happened in December,\u201d Eugenio Aleman, chief economist for Raymond James, wrote in a note issued Wednesday.\nEconomists were expecting inflation to pick up 0.3% from November and notch a 2.8% annual increase, primarily due to expectations around higher energy and food prices. The consensus estimates on FactSet did anticipate core slowing on a monthly basis but holding firm at 3.3% for the year.\nWednesday\u2019s report marked the final CPI reading for 2024 and the last before President Joe Biden hands the keys over to President-elect Donald Trump.\nWhile the causes of this recent bout of inflation were multifaceted and largely related to the Covid-19 pandemic and its fallout, the sharp rise in prices hit Americans hard and proved to be a critical factor at the ballot box.\nPrices of everyday items are 21% higher than they were in 2021. (Over a typical four-year period, prices tend to rise just under 10%, BLS data shows).\nWages have risen faster than inflation for 20 months, the latest BLS data shows; however, they remain below where they were four years ago.\nInflation has slowed significantly since topping out at 9.1% in June 2022. However, the return to more typical rates of inflation was expected to be highly bumpy, and that choppiness was on full display in 2024.\nThe CPI started this past year at 3.1%, jutted higher in March \u2014 an increase feared as a reacceleration \u2014 kept interest rate cuts off the table but ultimately was short-lived. Consumer price inflation slowed as low as 2.4% in September, but as the past three months have shown, the path back to normal isn\u2019t smooth.\nAnd although markets cheered the data for how it may factor into the Fed\u2019s fight against inflation and any future reduction ofhigh interest rates, it doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that \u201cthis was a particularly painful report\u201d for American consumers, noted Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\u201cThe cost of necessities that hurt household budgets, especially for lower-income Americans, were among the top reasons inflation rose in December,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThose include higher prices for food, both in restaurants and grocery stores, energy, shelter and vehicle insurance.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/15\/economy\/us-cpi-consumer-price-index-december","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Credit scores drop at fastest pace since the Great Recession","date":"2025-09-16","body":"Credit scores are falling at the fastest pace since the Great Recession as Americans struggle to keep up with the high cost of living and the return of student debt payments.\nThe national average FICO score dropped by two points this year, the most since 2009, according to data released Tuesday by the analytics company.\nAlthough credit scores remain significantly higher than during the Great Recession, they are down for thesecond year in a row.FICO found a growing share of borrowers are falling behind on car loans, credit cards and personal loans.\nYounger Americans, exposed to the double whammy ofhigh student debtandlow entry-level hiring,are under even more financial pressure.\nGen Z borrowers experienced an average credit score drop of three points \u2014 the biggest decline of any age group since 2020 during the pandemic, according to FICO.\nThe findings underscore thegrowing disconnectbetween the euphoria on Wall Street and pessimism on Main Street. While US stocks continue to shatter record highs, a significant chunk of Americans say they are hurting.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a K-shaped economy where those with wealth tied to stock market portfolios and rising home values are doing well and others are struggling with high rates and affordability problems,\u201d Tommy Lee, senior director at FICO, told CNN.\nAverage credit scores fell sharply after the 2008 financial crisis, as unemployment skyrocketed and millions of Americans could not make their mortgage payments and defaulted on their auto loans.\nCredit scores increased each year from 2013 to 2024, when they dropped by a single point, according to FICO.\nBut FICO found that delinquency rates on auto loans, credit cards and personal loans are at or near their highest levels since 2009.\nThese delinquency rates are \u201cmore consistent with an economy in recession than one still in expansion,\u201d FICO said, adding that mortgage and home equity loan delinquency rates are still near historic lows.\nFICO found that 14% of Gen Zers have had a large credit score decline of 50 points or more in the past year \u2014 more than any other year and double the decline of 2021.\nAt least some of this pressure on younger Americans is linked to student debt.\nFollowing a Covid-era pause, student loan delinquencies were not reported on credit files until February. The Department of Education restarted collecting federal student loans in default in May.\nThis shift disproportionately impacts Gen Zers because about one in three (34%) of them have open student loans, double the national at large, according to FICO.\nBetween February and April, 6.1 million consumers had a student loan delinquency added to their credit file, according to FICO. That means the student loan delinquency rate has climbed to a record high of 29% among the 21 million borrowers with a student debt payment due.\nAnother 1.9 million consumers haven\u2019t had a delinquency reported even though they have student debt payments due and haven\u2019t made payments.\nThe impact of these late student debt payments is amplified by the fact that Gen Zers often don\u2019t have the long history of making credit payments that feed into credit scores. That makes their credit scores vulnerable to more volatility, both up and down.\nAnother problem: Younger Americans are also contending with the most difficult job market in years for new college graduates.\nDimitri Tsolakis, 22, said he applied to hundreds of jobs after graduating from American University in 2024 with a degree in international relations.\nIt took Tsolakis 14 months to finally land a full-time job, or at least one that wasn\u2019t a scam. But the job he did get, as a secretary at a law firm in Orlando, called for a dramatic cut to his income relative to his prior work as a server.\n\u201cMy credit score took a drastic hit because I had to compromise and take a job where I\u2019m severely underpaid,\u201d Tsolakis told CNN in a phone interview.\nTsolakis owes $35,000 in student debt but has had to pause repayments to focus on making his car payments and paying for other living expenses.\nHe\u2019s hardly alone in skipping payments.\nAbout one in five (19%) of consumers say they paid less or skipped bills to get by in the past year, according to a Julysurveyby the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. That\u2019s up from 17% ayear earlier.\nEven more consumers (47%) said they cut discretionary spending in the past year, while 23% said they reduced essential spending.\nFICO found that 64% of Gen Z and 61% of Millennials with student loans rely on credit cards, buy-now-pay-later loans or personal loans to bridge financial gaps.\nSue Murphy, a nurse in Philadelphia, took a parent-PLUS loan to help fund her daughter\u2019s college education. The $70,000 in student debt requires monthly payments of just over $500.\nTo make ends meet, Murphy took on a second job, making her schedule 12 days on and one day off.\n\u201cIt almost feels like it doesn\u2019t pay to be an honest hardworking citizen in this country anymore,\u201d Murphy said.\nThe plan had been to make 10 years of payments and then have the balance of the student debt forgiven because Murphy works at Temple Health in Philadelphia, a nonprofit medical system that qualifies for public service loan forgiveness.\nHowever, Murphy now fears the student debt won\u2019t qualify for forgiveness because of rule changes proposed by the Trump administration.\nAt the order of the White House, the Education Department hasproposed amending the definitionof employers that qualify for loan forgiveness by excluding employers involved in \u201cillegal activities.\u201d\n\u201cThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program exists to serve American heroes like teachers, police officers, and firefighters \u2014 not individuals or employers engaged in illegal activities that harm Americans,\u201d Ellen Keast, deputy press secretary at the Education Department, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe Department has no business subsidizing the employees who work for organizations that break the law by mutilating and maiming healthy children or aiding and abetting illegal immigration and terrorism.\u201d\nMurphy said she makes her payments on time so her credit score hasn\u2019t gone down drastically but her high debt-to-income ratio doesn\u2019t help matters.\n\u201cI will go into retirement with student debt,\u201d Murphy said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/16\/economy\/debt-credit-score-student-loans","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Americans\u2019 credit card debt falls, but past-due student loans drag on credit scores","date":"2025-05-13","body":"Americans tidied up their household balance sheets to start 2025, cleaning up some credit card and auto loan debt, new data showed Tuesday.\nHowever, the debt outlookformillions of student loan borrowerswas much grimmer: Past-due student loans hit credit reports for the first time in five years, tanking credit scores in the process.\nThe latest snapshot of how economy-powering consumers are managing their debt loads was released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in theclosely watchedQuarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit.\nDuring the first quarter, total household debt increased by $167 billion, just 0.9%, to $18.2 trillion, according to the report. Credit card and auto loan balances fell by $29 billion and $13 billion, respectively.\nAggregate delinquency rates increased to 4.3% from the fourth quarter and to a level in line with what was seen pre-pandemic, New York Fed data shows. Flows into delinquency (30 days or more late) and serious delinquency (90-plus days) held fairly steady with the fourth quarter.\nThe first quarter typically sees a pullbackin credit card debtas consumers rein in post-holiday spending and pay off those purchases.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by the modest decrease,\u201d cautioned Ted Rossman, Bankrate senior industry analyst. \u201cCredit card balanc\ufeffes and interest rates remain near record highs, and Americans\u2019 total consumer debt load is a record $18.2 trillion.\u201d\nMortgage and student loan balances also hit fresh records last quarter, Rossman wrote in commentary issued Tuesday. Mortgage and student loan balances established fresh records in Q1, while credit card and auto loan debt fell slightly.\nAlso, he noted, credit card balances are 54% higher than they were four years ago and auto loan balances have risen by 19%.\nHigher debt balances are to be expected, especially sincethe New York Fed data is not adjusted for inflation. Also playing a role are factors such as population growth, the rise of e-commerce (which relies oncredit versus cash) and strong consumer spending.\nThe drop in car loan balances, which fell on a quarterly basis for the first time since 2011, did surprise analysts and economists.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a combination of people not buying (cars) because of high interest rates and high prices and also just the amount of uncertainty that we have had in the economy the last few months,\u201d Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, told CNN Business in an interview. \u201cThat may have spurred people to hunker down a little bit.\u201d\nThose spending patterns changed in recent weeks as consumers rushed to purchase new vehicles ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. Those loans could take a month or two before they\u2019re reported, Schulz said.\nIt was expected that both student loan balances as well as delinquency rates would likely shoot higher from the fourth quarter.\nThe pandemic provided a reprieve for millions of student loan borrowers, as stimulus checks and payment pauses allowed many of them to bring down their balances. Others\u2019 loans, however, were stuck in limbo as the Biden administration\u2019s plans for student loan forgiveness hit a wall of legal challenges.\nThe 3.5-year payment pauseended in September 2023; however, an additional provision under the Biden administration provided a one-year \u201con-ramp\u201d where borrowers were shielded from negative effects of a missed payment. That grace period ended September 30, 2024, and missed payments started hitting credit reports.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an organic progression that has gotten us here; it has been a very sudden change in circumstances that, in the grand scheme of things, feels like it was overnight,\u201d Charlie Wise, senior vice president and head of global research and consulting at TransUnion, told CNN Business in an interview.\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking consumers who have not had to make a payment for five years to start making payments, and many of them weren\u2019t prepared for that,\u201d he added. \u201cTheir incomes probably changed; their spending has probably changed. They may have much higher obligations, the\ufeffy may have mortgage payments, they may have higher rent. Their lifestyles have changed and all of a sudden now, they\u2019re being required to add this additional payment in almost overnight.\u201d\nStudent loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1% following the ending of a pandemic-era pause of reporting past-due loans on credit reports, according to the New York Fed report.\nThe highest rates of student loan delinquency occurred in southern states, with Mississippi having the largest share of borrowers who have at least one student loan in serious (90 days or more) delinquency, the analysis showed.\nA quarter of the borrowers who were in any stage of delinquency were over 40 years old, according to New York Fed researchers.\nAnd while more than half of the newly delinquent borrowers already had subprime credit scores, 2.4 million others had scores above 620 and saw average negative score changes north of 140 points, New York Fed research showed.\nThose with credit scores greater than 720 had their scores tumble by an average of 177 points.\nSuch a drop could knock a super prime borrower down to subprime status, TransUnion\u2019s Wise said.\n\u201cWhich means that those consumers who previously would have had very good access to most credit products, including mortgages, now will have a much more difficult time getting credit \u2014 if at all,\u201d Wise said.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/13\/business\/household-debt-report-credit-cards-student-loans","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Congress needs to address debt ceiling before its August recess to prevent default, Treasury secretary says","date":"2025-05-09","body":"Lawmakers have until August to address the debt ceiling or the US could default on its obligations for the first time ever, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote to congressional leaders Friday, urging them to act even sooner, \u201cto protect the full faith and credit of the United States.\u201d\nThe projection gives Republican lawmakers \u2013 who control Capitol Hill \u2013 a firmer deadline of when they have to pass their massive budget reconciliation bill, which aims to increase the debt ceiling along with extending the 2017 tax cuts and slashing federal spending.\nIn his letter, Bessent said there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the cash and extraordinary measures that are allowing Treasury to continue paying the nation\u2019s bills in full and on time will be exhausted in August, pointing out that is when Congress is scheduled to be in recess.But he noted that the projection is subject to \u201csignificant uncertainty.\u201d\n\u201cTherefore, I respectfully urge Congress to increase or suspend the debt limit by mid-July, before its scheduled break, to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\u201d he wrote.\nTreasury has been using cash and extraordinary measures to pay the nation\u2019s bills in full and on time since January 21, when the US hit its roughly $36 trillion debt ceiling. Once the nation reaches that cap, which it has done repeatedly, it can no longer borrow to cover its obligations in full and on time. A default would likely cause global economic upheaval.\nHouse GOP leaders are closely monitoring projections for the so-called X-date, when the government could default, House Speaker Mike Johnson said at an Axios event in late April.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big pressure point, and we don\u2019t know exactly when that X date will fall,\u201d Johnson said, noting at the time that he was working under the assumption it could be as early as the beginning of June. \u201cWe can\u2019t be caught flat-footed on this.\u201d\nHowever, the caucus remains divided over how to address all three of its goals in the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d leaving leaders with the tricky task of constructing a package that can get enough GOP votes to pass both chambers.\nIn March, Bessent told lawmakers that he would continue using extraordinary measures \u2013 which are largely behind-the-scenes accounting maneuvers \u2013 through June 27.\nThe Congressional Budget Office in Marchprojectedthat the \u201cX-date\u201d would be reached in August or September.\nThough they control Congress,Republicans are dividedover how to handle the debt ceiling. The House has included a $4 trillion increase to the cap inits budget resolution, while theSenate versionraises the limit by $5 trillion. President Donald Trump has pushed GOP lawmakers to address the limit as soon as possible.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/09\/politics\/treasury-debt-ceiling-x-date","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The debt ceiling is back, but no need to worry \u2013 yet","date":"2025-01-02","body":"Thenation\u2019s debt ceilingwas reinstated Thursday, giving congressional Republicans yet another divisive challenge to contend with in 2025.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is demanding that GOP lawmakers address the limit before he takes office on January 20, but lawmakers have some time since the US is likely months away from a potential first-ever default on its obligations.\nThe new ceiling is the amount of outstanding debt subject to the limit at the end of the previous day. That figure stood at just over $36.1 trillion on December 31, up from $31.4 trillion in June 2023, when the cap was suspended as part of the bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act.\nBut in a technical quirk, the nation won\u2019t actually be at the limit on Thursday, allowing the Treasury Department to continue borrowing for a little longer to pay the federal government\u2019s bills in full and on time. The debt level is projected to dip by $54 billion that day due to the scheduled redemption of certain securities, according to a letter Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sent to congressional leaders on Friday afternoon.\nTherefore, the US isn\u2019t expected to reach the reinstated limit until sometime between January 14 and January 23, Yellen wrote in her letter. It will then be necessary for the Treasury Department to start taking so-called extraordinary measures to prevent a default. That\u2019s because the nation spends more than it receives in revenue, and it has to borrow to cover the difference. But it can\u2019t once it hits the debt limit.\nYellen \u2013 or the acting agency leader if the limit is reached after Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20 \u2013 will inform Congress at that time and outline how the department will proceed. The letter also will likely provide lawmakers with an estimate of when these efforts could be exhausted, or the so-called X date.\nTreasury\u2019s cash and extraordinary measures should last for at least several months after the first quarter of 2025, according to an early analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\u201cThe federal government will begin 2025 with significantly more cash on hand compared to the start of the most recent debt limit debate in 2023,\u201d said Shai Akabas, executive director of the center\u2019s economic policy program. \u201cThis cushion, followed by the buoy of extraordinary measures and April tax receipts, means that the debt limit will not be the first deadline Congress faces in the new year. Each bill they work on in the coming months offers an opportunity for a timely debt limit resolution.\u201d\nJust how long Congress has to handle its debt ceiling dilemma depends heavily on the amount of federal tax revenue collected this spring, the pace at which supplemental disaster assistance funds are spent, additional federal spending legislation and the health of the economy, according to the center.\nJust what would happen if the nation actually defaults on its debt isunknownbecause it\u2019s never happened. The Treasury Department would have to decide what bills to pay \u2013 including Social Security benefits and federal workers\u2019 salaries \u2013 based on the revenue it receives daily. A default could also roil the global economy and stock markets and likely prompt yields on US Treasuries to rise, increasing borrowing costs.\nAlthough Republicans will control Capitol Hill this year, it won\u2019t be easy for the party\u2019s leaders to address the debt ceiling, especially if they opt to craft legislation without Democratic support. Since the GOP will hold a super-slim majority in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson won\u2019t be able to afford many defections, particularly among conservative lawmakers, who have demanded that any increase or suspension of the limit be accompanied by spending cuts.\nTrump, however, is ramping up the pressure on congressional Republicans. Hederaileda bipartisan temporary government spending agreement last month by demanding the GOP deal with the debt ceiling as part of the package. Ultimately, Congress passed ashort-term funding billwithout a debt ceiling provision.\nThe president-elect reiterated his demands on Sunday.\n\u201cThe Democrats must be forced to take a vote on this treacherous issue NOW, during the Biden Administration, and not in June,\u201d Trumpposted on Truth Social. \u201cThey should be blamed for this potential disaster, not the Republicans!\u201d\nGOP leaders in the House last month floated an idea to raise the debt limit by $1.5 trillion in 2025 as part of a first reconciliation package, which may includeborder security and energy measures. The legislation would also include $2.5 trillion in cuts to net mandatory spending, aimed at satisfying conservative members who oppose increasing the debt ceiling without accompanying cuts.\nRepublicans are looking to use thereconciliation processto pass some of their top priorities because they would need only a simple majority of votes in the Senate. The party will have 53 Senate seats this year.\nHowever, even if the GOP increases the debt limit by $1.5 trillion on its own, that would not buy the party much time, Akabas said. The US would hit the new ceiling in the second half of the year, with the potential of default coming in the first half of 2026, according to hisback-of-the-envelope calculation.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/02\/business\/us-debt-ceiling-trump-yellen","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"The company behind your credit score is plunging on the stock market after a White House announcement","date":"2025-07-08","body":"Mortgage lenders will soon have a new way to assess borrowers applying for government-backed loans. That sent the stock of America\u2019s biggest credit score company plunging Tuesday.\nFederal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte announced that lenders may start using VantageScore, a rival to the Fair Isaac Corporation, the company behind the widely recognized FICO score, to assess creditworthiness for government-sponsored Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgages.\n\u201cEffective today, to increase competition to the Credit Score Ecosystem and consistent with President Trump\u2019s landslide mandate to lower costs, Fannie and Freddie will ALLOW lenders to use Vantage 4.0 Score with no current requirement to build new infrastructure,\u201d Pulte wrote in a Tuesday social mediapost.\nPulte said that Tuesday\u2019s announcement would expand credit access andbring down closing costs.\nThe announcement comes as FICO\u2019s credit check fees have reportedly surged in recent years. Shares of FICO (FICO), VantageScore\u2019s biggest rival, tumbled more than 17% Tuesday afternoon following the news.\nFor decades, FICO has dominated the mortgage market, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac accepting only FICO scores. But in recent years, VantageScore, created in 2006 by the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) as a FICO competitor, has gained traction.\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s announcement, mortgage lenders were already beginning to use VantageScore. In 2022, during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, theFHFA announcedthat after a multi-year transition period, lenders would be required to deliver mortgage loans with scores from both FICO and VantageScore to ensure that a person\u2019s creditworthiness was properly vetted.\nLast year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced apublic inquiryinto \u201cjunk fees\u201d that increase mortgage closing costs, specifically mentioning the recent rise in the cost of obtaining a credit report.\n\u201cThe market for credit scores has long been dominated by one company\u2019s algorithm: the Fair Isaac Corporation, which sells the FICO score,\u201d former CFPB chairman Rohit Choprasaidlast year in a speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association. \u201cMortgage lenders have shared that costs for credit reports and scores have increased, sometimes by 400% since 2022.\u201d\nIn May, Pulte first posted on social media about the increase in credit reports, writing: \u201cWhy do some credit reports cost double (Biden\u2019s term) from what they did during President Trump\u2019s first term?\u201d\nBoth FICO and VantageScore issue a credit score between 300 and 850 to potential borrowers with the goal of predicting the likelihood that a person will fall behind on debt repayments. A higher score means you\u2019re less likely to miss a payment, but the two companies have differing methodologies to arrive at that score.\nIn a separatesocial media post, Pulte said Tuesday\u2019s directive will enable Americans to use their rent to qualify for a mortgage, rather than relying solely on credit history based on credit cards and loans.\nVantageScore takes rent payments into account if those payments are reported to Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, according to VantageScore\u2019s website.\nIn a statement, FICO said the latest version of its credit scoring system can also account for rent payments, and its product is \u201cfreely chosen\u201d by lenders for its reliability.\n\u201cFICO welcomes competition on a level playing field among credit score providers. We compete vigorously in every US consumer credit market, and the FICO Score is freely chosen by lenders, investors, and other market participants because it is trusted as the most predictive and reliable credit score,\u201d a FICO spokesperson said.\nDespite the drop in FICO\u2019s stock on Tuesday, the threat to FICO\u2019s market dominance might be limited, said Jaret Seiberg, a housing policy analyst at TD Cowen.\n\u201cWe have trouble seeing lenders abandoning FICO just because they are now able to use Vantage Score,\u201d Seiberg wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. \u201cThis is because lenders have very little experience using Vantage Score when it comes to mortgages.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/07\/08\/business\/mortgage-lender-credit-fico-vantage-score","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}

{"title":"Americans are feeling worse about the economy \u2014 especially Republicans","date":"2025-06-24","body":"Consumer confidence dropped last month to a reading of 93, a 5.4 point decline from May, according to data the Conference Board released on Tuesday. The decline was seen across all political affiliations but was strongest among Republican respondents.\nConsumers had been feeling better after an agreement was secured between the United States and China to lower massive tariffs on each other \u2014 but mounting uncertainty over President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policy and tensions in the Middle East are leaving consumers feeling less gung-ho about what the US economy has in store.\nThe drop in consumer confidence, which erased nearly half of last month\u2019s gain, is in contrast to the one-point bump that economists polled by FactSet were anticipating.\nThe survey\u2019s cutoff date was June 18, days before the US bombed Iran, targetingits three main nuclear sites. Stephanie Guichard, senior economist overseeing global indicators at the Conference Board, noted, \u201cReferences to geopolitics and social unrest increased slightly from previous months but remained much lower on the list of topics affecting consumers\u2019 views.\u201d\nFar more pertinent to consumers were tariffs, which \u201cwere frequently associated with concerns about their negative impacts on the economy and prices,\u201d Guichard said in a statement published Tuesday.\n\u201cAs we wait to see the full impact of tariffs on prices, this uncertain sentiment could trigger reduced consumer spending,\u201d Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said in a note Tuesday. \u201cAfter all, if you can\u2019t be sure of how big your grocery bill will be in coming months, it\u2019s difficult to budget for it.\u201d\nThus far, theimpact of higher tariffshasn\u2019t shown up in headline inflation data. However, individual items, such as electronics, have become more expensive, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted during the central bank\u2019s post-monetary policy meeting press conference last week.\nMore consumers noted in the survey they were putting off purchases of electronics as well as homes. But purchases for other big-ticket items like cars and appliances held strong.\nAdditionally, the share of consumers expecting a recession over the next 12 months rose slightly last month. Optimism about job prospects, future income and business conditions weakened.\n\u201cIn this kind of environment, it\u2019s not surprising that consumers are hesitant to make big purchases,\u201d Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a note Tuesday. \u201cThey are sitting on the sidelines and only buying homes, cars and appliances if they absolutely must.

{"title":"America\u2019s economy could face a war shock","date":"2025-06-19","body":"As if a global trade war wasn\u2019t enough for businesses and consumers to contend with, it\u2019s looking increasingly likethe Israel-Iran conflictcould reach the brink of a full-blown war. While the conflict is playing out thousands of miles away from US soil, Americans may not be able to escape the economic impact of it.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powelltold reporters Wednesdayafter the central bank\u2019s latest monetary policy meeting that officials are monitoring the situation. \u201cWhat\u2019s tended to happen is when there\u2019s turmoil in the Middle East, you may see a spike in energy prices, but it tends to come down,\u201d he said in response to a question from CNN\u2019s Matt Egan.\n\u201cThose things don\u2019t generally tend to have lasting effects on inflation, although, of course, in the 1970s they famously did because you had a series of very, very large shocks,\u201d Powell added.\nAmong those: The Iranian Revolution, which caused global oil production to fall substantially and then contributed to already-high gas prices as a result of the Arab oil embargo following the Yom Kippur war. Powell seemed assured there isn\u2019t a risk of such a scenario this time around, adding that \u201cthe US economy is far less dependent on foreign oil than it was back in the 1970s.\u201d\nEconomists, however, aren\u2019t as convinced that the conflict doesn\u2019t present a major risk to the US economy.\nIn fact, JPMorgan economists said in a recent note to clients, \u201cThe US and global economies are set to absorb multiple shocks this year.\u201d Chief among those is the potential for a Middle East war, they said.\n\u201cOne of the most direct impacts on US consumers would be if the Strait of Hormuz was closed, leading to a spike in energy costs as the flow of seaborne oil and gas becomes disrupted,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. The US Energy Information Administration recently referred to the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, as \u201cone of the world\u2019s most important oil chokepoints.\u201d\nLast year, the amount of oil that passed through the waterway averaged 20 million barrels per day, it said, which amounts to about 20% of global petroleum liquids consumption.\n\u201cVery few alternative options exist to move oil out of the strait if it is closed,\u201d the EIA said in an onlinearticleon Monday. Meanwhile, Iran hasrepeatedly threatenedto shut down the strait as a form of retaliation.\nThat could end up proving to be more limited than what the Iranian government has threatened, though, analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a recent note.\n\u201cIran\u2019s leadership is unlikely to fully close the Strait of Hormuz for an extended period; as a first recourse, it is more likely that Iran\u2019s naval forces deploy along the Strait and block passage to selected vessels depending on flag and destination.\u201d\nEven though the US is considered energy independent,gas priceswould still \u201crocket higher,\u201d Knightley.\nWhile tariff-related price hikes that economists widely expect to occur haven\u2019t shown up in the all-encompassing inflation reports the US government publishes, most believe it\u2019s only a matter of time.\nAs the economy recovered from the pandemic, inflation accelerated across the globe. Then, while that unfolded, the war between Russia and Ukraine took hold, sending gas prices soaring and pushing inflation even higher.\nThat could very well play out again if gas prices shoot higher due to the conflict.\n\u201cWith tariff-induced price hikes already set to squeeze household spending power, higher gasoline prices would intensify the strain on consumer pockets, risking a more pronounced slowdown in the economy,\u201d Knightley told CNN.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/19\/economy\/americas-economy-war-shock","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The reasons are complicated.\nAyala is a natural-born US citizen, and his wife is a naturalized citizen. But given reports of people \u2014even with legal status\u2014 being detained and questioned at US borders, Ayala said taking a trip out of the country for fun doesn\u2019t seem worth the potential risk.\nAyala also sees another problem: the economy. \u201cThe writing is on the wall \u2026 The moment I saw the market volatility, I\u2019m like, \u2018Yep, this is not going to be good.\u2019\u201d\nTravel advisers are seeing the impact of that uncertainty. More than 80% of the 460 advisers surveyed recently byTravelAge Westwere \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned about the impact of a possible economic downturn on their business, and more than half were \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the impact of government policies.\nTheir clients\u2019 top concern was economic uncertainty, followed by worries about the treatment of Americans abroad, safety and security, fears of cost increases due to tariffs, immigration and border policies, and travel restrictions.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just take one angle and say, \u2018Oh, the economy is having an issue. So let\u2019s find something less expensive,\u2019\u201d said Beci Mahnken, CEO of MEI-Travel. Other clients say, \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t want to travel to the United States,\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t want to travel outside the United States.\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s like a rock tunnel, going and going.\u201d\nOne shaft of light at the end of that tunnel could be savings on last-minute summer trips as travelers increasingly take a wait-and-see stance with their plans.\nMahnken first saw signs of trouble in early April,when US stocks plungedover fears of a chaotic trade war.\nMahnken and her travel agency staff started getting phone calls from clients, calling to cancel vacations they had booked or seeking refundable trips. She said they were fearful because their 401(k)s and other investments had taken a dive. That uncertainty, she says, made them pause on discretionary spending like a summer trip.\nUntil that moment, Mahnken said, the frenzy of heightened \u201crevenge travel\u201d activity that started after pandemic restrictions lifted had not slowed over the course of four years.\n\u201cWe were still on this incredible high,\u201d Mahnken said. \u201cAnd then \u2026 it almost hit a brick wall.\u201d\nFlight analytics firm Cirium pulled flight booking data from online travel agencies from the end of January through early May, when people typically book summer trips. That data, which Cirium shared with CNN, indicates that bookings for travel in June, July and August are down nearly 10% when looking at flights from major US airports to favorite European destinations, compared to the same period last year.\nFlights booked in the opposite direction from Europe to the US are down 12% in the same period. That substantial drop is unusual, according to Jeremy Bowen, CEO of Cirium.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t often see it as wholesale as this and over such a short period of time. Really, that Q1 booking is really quite substantially lower since the beginning of the year,\u201d said Bowen.\nRelated articleThe top 10 US beaches for 2025, according to \u2018Dr. Beach\u2019\nData on US travelers booking summer trips to Asia is a bit more mixed, with increased bookings to destinations like Hong Kong and Tokyo, but decreases in flights booked to other major cities in the region.\nDomestic travel in the US also seems to be down by about 5%, using the same search parameters.\n\u201cPotentially people are waiting to see,\u201d Bowen said.\nThe drop hasn\u2019t been steady. Mahnken said once the stock market stabilized, her clients started feeling a little bit more comfortable with spending more. But it\u2019s what Mahnken calls a \u201cbouncing ball\u201d that could change again tomorrow.\nMahnken, who has been in the travel industry since before 9\/11, remembers how travelers behaved after terrorist attacks, during the 2008 recession and post-Covid. But the challenge this time, she says, is a combination of those experiences, including economic unpredictability and geopolitical forces.\nDeloitte\u2019s2025 summer travel surveyshows Americans still plan to travel this season. In fact, Deloitte data released on May 20 shows a 5% increase in Americans planning to take leisure trips this summer, but they may be taking cheaper trips than ones planned just months ago.\nThat could mean more road trips, rather than dealing with flights that would have to be canceled in case the whole trip is scrapped, Mahnken said.\nThat\u2019s especially true for anyone concerned about their job stability, or people worried they might have to scale back on discretionary spending if markets take another tumble.\n\u201cWe have people (who) are tending to now book closer in, rather than booking farther out, because \u2026 they feel more comfortable with their situation over the next four to six months, as opposed to the next eight to 12, which is a normal booking window for big vacations,\u201d she said.\nFor Ayala, this environment means being strategic about which trips are worth taking.\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re going to have a full-blown recession,\u201d Ayala said. \u201cBut we are definitely going to have a slowing down of the economy, at least \u2026 If you can save yourself a hassle and save yourself the money, this would be the year to do it.\u201d\nHe and his wife canceled their cruise to Alaska, departing from a Canadian port, after seeing several European nationsissue warnings to their citizensabout potential problems entering the United States.\nBut they still plan to attend two weddings in Mexico this year because they are important family events.\nStill, Ayala said he fears being profiled coming back from those trips just because of his name, even if there is no malice on the side of the border agent. He said he feels that on paper, agents could see a Hispanic name and become overzealous in questioning him.\n\u201cI do dread the return. I do think that there is a non-zero chance that I will have to call my employer and say, \u2018Hey, guess what? I\u2019m not coming into work because I couldn\u2019t get back,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is an important life event. This one is worth the risk, whereas just traveling for pleasure is not.\u201d\nThe difference in the way people are booking summer travel, and where they\u2019re going, could create opportunities for people looking for a last-minute deal.\nTiffany Funk, co-founder of point.me, a travel points optimization site, said people with loyalty points should use them, because they\u2019re worth more now than they will be in the future. Funk said people can be surprised at how much farther points will take them internationally than on domestic trips.\nBut she said there are some interesting trends domestically, partly becausesome Canadians have canceled their trips.\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually some deals to be had in places like New England and the coast of Maine, where typically you would have had to book in some cases years ago, in order to secure availability there. But we\u2019re seeing some good deals there,\u201d Funk said.\n\u201cFlorida, you have the Gulf Coast, where you can get some pretty decent pricing on very popular family-friendly destinations that are usually just horrifically expensive for summer vacations,\u201d she said.\nMahnken said as cruise lines continue tolaunch megashipsthat were in production long before the current economic turbulence, they will need to fill rooms. She also points out the unusual number of theme park discounts out this season.\n\u201cI am seeing a lot of cruise lines do incredibly good sales for their closer-in [dates],\u201d she said. \u201cTheme parks \u2026 we\u2019re seeing them put out a lot of marketing and a lot of monetary offers during what\u2019s usually a high-season time.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/25\/travel\/summer-travel-plans-uncertainty-economy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Consumer confidence sinks to lowest level since May 2020","date":"2025-04-29","body":"Americans continue to grow uneasy about the economy as President Donald Trump wages an erratic trade war that could send US inflation rising and even trigger a recession.\nConsumer confidence sank 7.9 points in April to a reading of 86, the Conference Board said in its latest survey released Tuesday. That\u2019s the lowest level since May 2020 and a larger decline than economists had projected. The survey\u2019s Expectations Index, which captures people\u2019s outlook on the economy, plummeted 12.5 points this month to 54.4, the lowest level in 13 years.\nMeanwhile, the share of Americans anticipating a recession in the year ahead climbed to a two-year high, the survey showed. Trump\u2019s tariffs were \u201con top of consumers\u2019 minds,\u201d according to their write-in responses.\nRelated articleCNN Poll: A growing majority says Trump has made the economy worse, with most skeptical of his tariff plans\n\u201cConsumers explicitly mentioned concerns about tariffs increasing prices and having negative impacts on the economy,\u201d the Conference Board said in a release.\nAs the Trump administration reaches its 100th day in power, varioussurveysandpollscontinue to show growing pessimism among US consumers. Their spending is the source of America\u2019s economic might, powering about 70% of its output.\nSince taking office in January, Trump has pushed a chaotic tariff regime, slashed the federal workforce, clamped down on immigration and attacked the Federal Reserve. Not only have Trump\u2019s actions unsettled consumers, but they\u2019ve alsosent a chill down Wall Street\u2019s spine.\nPessimism hasn\u2019t led to weaker spending in recent years, but it\u2019s unclear whether that will remain the case this time around.\nIn June 2022, when consumer sentiment dropped to a record low as inflation reached a four-decade high, Americans continued to open their wallets in the following months.\nSimilarly in 2023, when a standoff in Congress over the debt ceiling unnerved consumers, people still dished out for concerts and travel that year.\nAstudy by Fed economistspublished Thursday showed as much, arguing that people have overestimated the effect of inflation on their finances in recent years, which in turn affected their perceptions of the economy. Researchers linked people\u2019s responses in surveys with their verified purchases from 2019 to 2024.\nStill, some Fed officials remain worried about America\u2019s souring economic mood and the possibility that consumers could actually pull back this time.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s lots of reasons to be worried about consumer spending,\u201d Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said last week at an event in Richmond, Virginia. \u201cConsumer sentiment has dropped, for example, pretty significantly over the last couple months and consumers seem to be more worried about inflation and worried about losing their job.\u201d\nFed officials are also concerned about people\u2019s perception of prices worsening in recent months, which could make the central bank\u2019s job of fighting inflation more difficult, if Trump\u2019s trade war indeed stokes inflation. That\u2019s because inflation expectations can be self-fulfilling, so if people expect prices to ratchet higher, they adjust their spending accordingly.\nInflation expectations in the year ahead rose in April to 7%, according to the Conference Board survey, the highest level since November 2022. A similar survey from the University of Michigan has similarly shown a run-up in year-ahead inflation expectations.\nTrump\u2019s trade war is far from settled and his administration has signaled it\u2019s not going to let up on its aggressive immigration crackdown, but there are other major policy changes on the horizon.\nThe Republican-led Congress, back from its two-week recess, is expected to pass legislation in the coming months to extend Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, which economists say will likely boost the economy \u2014 eventually.\nRelated articleThe US economy likely just had its worst quarter since Covid\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have a tariff-induced slowdown in the second half of 2025, but then fiscal policy will launch up the economy in 2026,\u201d said Nicole Cervi, an economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cWe look for personal tax rates to decline across the board, and our operating assumption is that you get an additional disposable income of $150 billion for the household sector in 2026.\u201d\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessenttold reporters on Mondaythat \u201cwe\u2019ve got three legs to the president\u2019s economic agenda: trade, tax and deregulation, and we hope that we can have this tax portion done by Fourth of July.\u201d\nTrump has taken tax relief a step further, claiming on Sunday that he will eliminate income taxes and replace that with revenue from tariffs, though such a developmentwould face many hurdles.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/29\/economy\/us-consumer-confidence-april","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

The US economy is not one of them.\nPowered byrelentless spendingfrom consumers, America\u2019s historic economic recovery from the pandemic crash continued in 2024.\nEconomic growth hasconsistently defied forecasts, overcoming lofty interest rates and uncomfortably high inflation. Financial markets boomed. Hiring slowed, but layoffsremain relatively low.\nEntering 2025, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the economy as the Trump administration prepares to take power.\n\u201cThe US economy, as it\u2019s done for many years, continues to chug along at a very steady pace,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\nRemember those 2022predictions of an almost-certain recession? Thankfully, that recession has yet to arrive.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation slowed economic growth, but not by nearly as much as feared. Markets buckled, but did not break.\nAnd although cracks emerged in the job market, the unemployment rate remains relatively low.\nUnlike at this point in 2021 and 2022, forecasters examining the fundamentals of the US economy don\u2019t see the obvious ingredients for a recession.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to need a shock to put the economy in recession,\u201d Kelly said, \u201cand I don\u2019t see anything internally in the economy to do that.\u201d\nOf course, there are external risks looming, including apotentially disastrous trade war.\nEnergy prices always have the potential to cause a recession. Gasoline\u2019s unprecedented spike above $5 a gallon in mid-2022 posed a clear and present danger to the US economy.\nThankfully, oil prices are far lower today. Fears of supply disruptions in the Middle East or in Russia have yet to materialize. If anything, supply has surprised to the upside, with the United States pumping more oil than any nation in world history.\nGasBuddy is projecting an annual average gas price of $3.22 a gallon for 2025, marking thethird straight year of falling pricesat the pump.\nMuted gas prices should help bolster consumer confidence and keep inflation statistics lower than otherwise.\nMany Americans are frustrated that they are paying a lot more at the grocery store, on car insurance and on rent than before Covid.\nRelated articleHere\u2019s what could get significantly more expensive under Trump\u2019s tariff plan\nAlthough the level of prices is likely not returning to 2019 levels, price increases have slowed substantially.\nNot only that, but paychecks are consistently growing faster than prices.\nThat means Americans are earning real wage increases that, if continued, should help them catch up to the higher level of prices and feel better about the cost of living.\n\u201cThe best we can do for them\u2026is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning big, real wage increases,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference in December. \u201cThat\u2019s what will restore people\u2019s good feeling about the economy. That\u2019s what it will take, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming for.\u201d\nTo fight inflation, the Fed spiked rates to multi-decade highs at a pace unseen since the 1980s. That war on inflation pushed up borrowing costs on mortgages, car loans, credit cards, car loans and small business loans.\nNow that inflation has cooled, the Fed has been able to cut interest rates in three consecutive meetings.\nThere remains considerable uncertainty over how many more rate cuts are on the way in 2025, if any. And borrowing costs on mortgages have failed to come down.\nStill, it is a positive for the economy that the Fed has started the process of lowering interest rates and this should provide a boost to growth in the coming months.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is laser-focused on boosting the US economy.\nThere\u2019s a lot of debate over the impact of the Trump agenda \u2014especially on inflation\u2014 but some economists are excited by the prospect of tax reform and Trump\u2019s promise to cut red tape.\nTrump hastapped Elon Musk to co-lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory board designed to cut wasteful spending and excessive regulations.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound sexy, but gosh that\u2019s where the big productivity gains come from,\u201d said Glenn Hubbard, former dean of the Columbia Business School and a former top economic adviser to President George W.

I am worried about that,\u201d said Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research.\nRelated articlePowell to Trump: Go ahead, make my day\nHowever, Roth is assuming Trump won\u2019t impose all the tariffs he has proposed, and that the tariffs that will get imposed won\u2019t arrive until late 2025.\nOn the other hand, if Trump were to enact all of his proposed tariffs, Roth said economic growth would likely get slashed in half to just 1% in 2025 \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t even account for the damage done by retaliatory tariffs.\n\u201cAt that point, recession risks become quite real,\u201d she said.\nThere\u2019s also a danger that Trump\u2019s promise to carry out mass deportations starves key industries of workers, driving up wages and prices.\nInvestors are likewise on high alert for a potential battle between Trump and Powell, his handpicked Fed chair.\n\u201cAnything aimed at Fed independence could really hurt market sentiment and become self-fulfilling,\u201d Wolfe said.\nAnother emerging risk is a severe storm in financial markets, which wereon fire much of 2024but ended the year on a weak note.\nConcerns have been rising over how expensive pockets of the market have become \u2014 especially Big Tech \u2014 andhow concentrated the gains have becomeamong the Magnificent Seven.\nA steep market correction, or even a bear market, could damage consumer and business confidence, weighing on the real economy.\nAnd then there are the wild cards \u2014 likecyberattacks, pandemics and natural disasters that are far harder to plan for.\n\u201cThe lessons of the 21st century are \u2018Don\u2019t worry about the stuff you\u2019re expecting,\u2019\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s Kelly said, \u201c\u2019Worry about the stuff you don\u2019t expect.\u2019\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/01\/economy\/2025-economy-jobs-markets","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Costco is poking the Trump bear","date":"2025-12-03","body":"Big public companies have mostly treated President Donald Trump with kid gloves during his second term. They\u2019ve quietly avoided conflict while seeking favor with ornate gifts, large donations to his pet projects and strategic deployments of CEOs to the Oval Office.\nThat\u2019s what made Costco\u2019s decision last week tosue the Trump administrationso shocking.\nCostco on Friday filed a lawsuit that contends Trump overstepped his emergency powers by imposing sweeping tariffs \u2013 and claimed the company is due a refund.\nCostco isn\u2019t alone. A handful of other companies have separately sued the government on similar grounds, including Bumble Bee Foods, Ray-Bans parent EssilorLuxottica, Revlon and Kawasaki Motors. But Costco is the highest profile public company to do battle with the Trump White House on tariffs.\nFew major corporations have been willing to publicly stick their necks out to combat Trump\u2019s policies since he took office in January. That stands in contrast to his first term, when businesses and their leaders felt more comfortable speaking out \u2013 most notably whenmultiple CEOs quit his business councilover comments Trump made in 2017 that downplayedneo-Nazi violencein Charlottesville, Virginia.\nBut Trump\u2019s second term has largely been marked by Corporate America\u2019s acquiescence. Several factors are at play:\nBut if businesses are going to start speaking out against Trump\u2019s policies, tariffs may be the logical place to start.\nTariffs are broadly \u2013 and increasingly \u2013 unpopular with Americans, who connect them with the country\u2019s affordability crisis.\nA CBS Newspollconducted in late October found that just 38% of Americans favor the United States placing new tariffs on goods imported from other countries. A clear majority, 62%, oppose. That marks a significant reversal from November 2024, when Americans narrowly favored new tariffs by 52% to 48% in a CBS Newspollat that time.\nBigger picture, a poll published byFox Newslast month showed only 15% of respondents said Trump\u2019s policies are helping their financial situation, compared to 46% who said they are hurting.\nSo Costco is probably not going to anger too many customers by speaking out against a trade policy that is unpopular in the first place.\nCostco didn\u2019t appear overly concerned: It used some choice words in its lawsuit, decrying \u201cthe pell-mell manner by which these on-again\/off-again\u201d tariffs were \u201cthreatened, modified, suspended, and re-imposed, with the markets gyrating in response.\u201d The company didn\u2019t say how much it paid in tariffs, but it demanded that they be refunded in full.\nThe Supreme Court appeared ready to declare the bulk of Trump\u2019s tariffs illegal, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett declared the refund process would almost certainly be \u201ca mess.\u201d Costco, seeing the handwriting on the wall, is trying to get in line early to collect.\nAlso, Costco may be uniquely situated. For example, the companydoubled down on its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, or DEI, while many other companies rapidly abandoned them in the face of a pressure campaign from Trump and conservative media. And with its emphasis on value in the face of high prices, Costco has proven resilient with customers.\nGoing up against Trump\u2019s tariffs has had mixed results. Some high-profile businesses that tried have been met with Trump\u2019s wrath.\nIn April, White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt held up a photo of Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos in a press briefing andpublicly shamed the companyfor considering advertising tariff costs to customers. Trump similarlythreatened Walmartafter the company said it would raise prices because of tariffs.\nIn a variation on the theme, Apple said in May that it would shift its US iPhone production to India from China after Trump imposed steep tariffs that would cost itnearly $1 trilliona quarter. An upset Trump a couple weeks later in Qatar said he had \u201ca little problem\u201d with CEO Tim Cook because of Apple\u2019s failure to bring iPhone production to the United States. By the end of the month, Trump hadthreatened a 25% tariffon Apple\u2019s products.\nBut in August, Cook made a public appearance in the Oval Office, promising anadditional $100 billionin US investment, and presented Trump with a plaque with a24K gold base. The tariff threat vanished.\nStill, with the Supreme Court decision looming and tariff popularity fading, some analysts believe Costco\u2019s lawsuit could attract followers.\n\u201cI expect many other companies will do the same,\u201d said Timothy Brightbill, a partner at Wiley who focuses on international trade.\nEd Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, agreed, arguing that Costco could give permission for some companies on the fence to file suit.\nBut some companies will still hesitate, he predicted.\n\u201cMy guess is the more business you have before the federal government, the less likely you are to sue,\u201d said Mills.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/12\/03\/business\/costco-trump-tariffs","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}

{"title":"Gulf nations are betting big on Egypt\u2019s North Coast","date":"2025-10-16","body":"Since the 1960s, Egypt\u2019s North Coast has been a popular vacation spot with the nation\u2019s wealthy elite. But now, its 650-mile-long Mediterranean shoreline is undergoing an unprecedented, and rapid, real estate transformation.\nOver the past two decades, an estimated $70 billion has been poured into the North Coast for city-scale projects, including holiday resorts, residential neighborhoods, and industrial zones \u2014 and at least $150 billion more in investment is expected in the coming decades, according to analysis from PwC Middle East.\nThis money is largely coming fromGulf nations, which have invested $59 billion in Egypt Since 2021, according to real estate consultancy Knight Frank. Qatar is reportedly currently discussing a$3.5 billiontourism project there, and last year, Egypt received its largest-ever single foreign investment, which saw$35 billionfrom Emirati sovereign wealth fund ADQ earmarked for real estate projects, including $24 billion for the development rights of Ras El Hekma on the North Coast.\nThe 170-square-kilometer peninsula \u2014 around the same size as Washington, DC \u2014 will be developed by Abu Dhabi-based Modon Holding, and is expected to include residences, resorts, retail, entertainment venues, and public facilities such as hospitals and schools. This aligns with the Egyptian government\u2019s push to diversify its economy, with hopes that new luxury resorts will help attract 30 million annual tourists by 2030, up from its record15.7 millioninternational visitors last year.\nA report from Knight Frank, published in September, found thathalf of high-net-worth individuals in the Gulfare looking for holiday homes in Egypt, and the North Coast is one of the nation\u2019s most popular real estate markets, second only to the New Administrative Capital.\n\u201cAnything that facilitates inbound investment is great \u2014 not just for Egypt, but around the region. These are emerging markets, and sentiment plays such an intangible role in boosting real estate market activity,\u201d says Faisal Durrani, head of research for MENA at Knight Frank Middle East, adding: \u201cThat feel-good factor is really difficult to quantify.\u201d\nMuch of this investment has been driven by Egypt\u2019s precarious financial situation: for the past decade, Gulf nations, along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and European Union, have been \u201cbailing out Egypt because they\u2019re afraid of what its collapse could mean,\u201d in terms of regional security and impact on global trade, says Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC.\nAnalysisfrom UK-based independent policy institute Chatham House indicates that between 2013 and 2016, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait provided around $30 billion in aid to Egypt, targeted at stabilizing its economy in the aftermath of the Arab Spring.\nBut three financial crises later, analysts say Gulf investors arenow looking for returns on their investment.\nThe development of Ras El Hekma will include a free zone says Kaldas, with its own tax and customs arrangements. He says that will encourage investment but cautions that it \u201cadds to questions about preserving state sovereignty over Egyptian territory, due to these large concessions to regional powers.\u201d\nEgypt holds an initial 35% stake in the project, and there\u2019s little transparency about the structure of the deal or how much it will have to pay for infrastructure, says Kaldas.\nAccording to Dr. Abdelkhalek Ibrahim, Egypt\u2019s deputy minister of housing, utilities and urban communities, the government is responsible for providing the project\u2019s main infrastructure, including electricity, communications and water supply.\n\u201cCreating new communities will impact positively on the macro economy by creating jobs, investment opportunities and economical activities,\u201d he told CNN in an email.\nThere have been other concerns raised over these massive real estate deals, including accusations of forced evictions of Ras El Hekma\u2019sIndigenous residents, and reports of coastal erosion from therapid development. The Egyptian government says it has compensated impacted homeowners and developed new settlements for them, and that all projects are being developed under a sustainable framework.\nDespite concerns, property prices in Egypt\u2019s North Coast are continuing to soar: in June, villa prices rose15.8%year-on-year, to an average of 20,000 Egyptian pounds ($420) per square meter. Last month, the first properties at Ras El Hekma launched off-plan, reportedly achieving sales of10 billion Egyptian pounds($210 million) within the first 48 hours.\nThere are a few factors behind the boom: a currency devaluation last year has meant more peopleinvestingin real estate to preserve savings, while recent legislation changes allowing foreigners to own property in Egypt furtherfueled demand, particularlyamong Gulf buyers. Additionally, rampant inflation has pushed up construction costs.\nOne of the region\u2019s largest operational developments is Marassi North Coast \u2014 a mixed-use residential, tourist and retail-lifestyle destination about 93 miles west of Alexandria. It was built by Dubai-based developer Emaar Properties, which says its properties now sell for up to $13,500 per square meter.\n\u201cIf you look at when we started, we used to sell apartments at $60,000,\u201d says Mohamed Ali Rashed Alabbar, founder and chairman of Emaar Properties. \u201cSome people made probably five times the value, now.\u201d\n\u201cAs a result of inflation, the quality of what you build, and competition, your value goes up,\u201d he adds.\nEmaar has invested $4 billion in Marassi North Coast, which employs around 20,000 people on-site and has already welcomed around four million tourists since April this year, says Alabbar.\nPlans to expand Marassi with another$1 billion investmentwere recently approved by the government, says Alabbar, adding that construction is expected to begin in the coming months.\nAdditional reporting by Yara Enany, CNN.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/16\/business\/egypt-north-coast-gulf-investment-spc","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"The world\u2019s most valuable company just blew through an unprecedented milestone","date":"2025-10-29","body":"Nvidia just became the world\u2019s first $5 trillion company.\nUnprecedented demand for the company\u2019s AI chips has propelled the company\u2019s market valuation into the stratosphere. The milestone, which Nvidia reached at Wednesday\u2019s open, comesjust three monthsafter the company crossed the $4 trillion mark. It took Nvidia about 13 months to go from $3 trillion to $4 trillion in valuation.\nThe company\u2019s shares (NVDA) rose 3% after the market opened on Wednesday. Nvidia stock has gained about 50% in 2025 and has been near or at the top of the S&P 500\u2019s best-performing stocks for years as investment in artificial intelligence continues to fuel the chipmaker\u2019s meteoric rise.\nBoosting Nvidia\u2019s stock Wednesday: hopes for discussions between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping that open up China\u2019s market to Nvidia\u2019s high-end AI chips. On Tuesday, Nvidia\u2019s stock rose after CEOJensen Huang presented a visionof Nvidia\u2019s future in which the company\u2019s chips would be placed in everything from cell phone towers to robotic factories to self-driving cars. Huang, in his first-ever keynote address at the company\u2019s GTC AI conference in Washington on Tuesday was effusive in his praise for Trump.\nNvidia\u2019s AI chips are essential to powering the data centers that run the technology. The company is central to the AI boom not just because of those chips that are making it tons of money, but also because of the investments it\u2019s pouring into other major players.\nOn Tuesday, another tech giant \u2014 Apple \u2014breached the $4 trillion benchmark. It\u2019s a sign that that the iPhone is still enough to excite consumers and Wall Street, even as the company has fallen behind in the AI race.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia and AI leader OpenAI recently announced a major new tie-up, which will have the ChatGPT maker purchase billions of dollars\u2019 worth of chips in exchange for a $100 billion investment from Nvidia that will be made over time. Nvidia alsoannounced a $5 billion investmentin beleaguered chipmaker Intel.\nApple is now worth $4,000,000,000,000\nBut the circular spending spree, paired with the industry\u2019s eye-popping growth rates and the lack of clarity around the return on AI investments, has raised concerns that the AI market may be a bubble waiting to burst.\nStill, Nvidia executives said during the company\u2019s August earnings call that it estimates it will benefit from as much as $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia raked in nearly $26 billion in net income.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/10\/29\/tech\/nvidia-5-trillion-valuation-ai","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Want evidence Trump\u2019s tariffs are upending the global economy? Here it is","date":"2025-04-22","body":"Ever since President Donald Trump introduced his first round of new tariffs, it\u2019s been a waiting game to see just how much they\u2019ll impact the global economy.\nThis week, one of the earliest signs was revealed \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t pretty.\nSouth Korea\u2019s Customs Service reported that exports for the first 20 days of April declined by 5.2% compared to the same period last year. That singular data point is a \u201ckey bellwether\u201d for where trade is heading, Min Joo Kang, a senior economist at ING, said in a note on Monday.\nThe decline in exports came after Trump enacted a 25% tariff on all aluminum, steel and auto imports. All other South Korean imports were also briefly subject to a 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff before Trump delayed it until July. Instead, imports from there are subject to anearly universal 10% tariff.\nThat was evident in the data, which showed that car and steel shipments fell 6.5% and 8.7%, respectively, year over year for the first 20 days of April. Overall exports from South Korea to the US declined by 14.3% from last year.\nThe bright spot was semiconductor exports, which rose 10.2% compared to last April. Semiconductors remain exempt from US tariffs, but Trump has said he aims to implement tariffs as high as 25% on the product.\nFor now, the South Korean data suggests that \u201cUS tariffs are complicating global trade dynamics,\u201d Kang said.\nBut things can often change on a month-to-month basis, so it might be too early to jump to any conclusions, cautioned Lee Branstetter, an economics and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University.\nIt is, however, \u201creasonable to attribute part of the export decline to the Trump-related disruptions in trade,\u201d he told CNN.\nBranstetter, who previously served as senior economist for international trade and investment on former President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said he expects forthcoming trade data from other American trade partners to paint a similar picture. But those changes might not show up as fast because it can take a while for new tariffs to manifest in trade data, he added.\nNevertheless, the International Monetary Fund is warning global economic growth will slow to 2.8% this year from the 3.3% rate it predicted last year, according to new forecasts released Tuesday.\nThe slowdown expected in the United States was even steeper, with its economy likely to grow only 1.8%, compared with a 2.8% expansion in 2024. The IMF cited \u201ctrade tensions and extremely high levels of policy uncertainty\u201d as reasons for the downward revisions.\nThe chaos that\u2019s ensued from Trump\u2019s on-and-off tariffs makes it increasingly hard to draw firm conclusions from forthcoming trade data.\nFor starters, it\u2019s possible that some countries\u2019 data will show exports to the US increased this month as businesses sought to take advantage of the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff pause.\nAnother major factor at play is the overarching uncertainty from Trump\u2019s trade policies. For instance, the president recently claimed he\u2019s negotiating deals with other nations, which he said could be finalized in a matter of weeks. At the same time, he\u2019s also threatened new tariffs.\nThat uncertainty could be causing businesses to pause international orders altogether. That means some countries\u2019 exports could decline, said Branstetter. For instance, one toy company CNN spoke with earlier this month saidit stopped ordering goods from Chinaover fears tariffs will continue to rise.\nThe trade picture for South Korea and the US could change, however, if talks between the two nations are sucessful.\nSouth Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Trade Minister Ahn Duk-geun are set to meet with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Thursday. The Trump administration has said it wants to prioritize trade deals with allies like South Korea.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/04\/22\/economy\/tariffs-trump-global-economy-evidence","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"America has ditched Europe. That presents an economic opportunity","date":"2025-03-06","body":"2025 has not been kind to Europe so far. The risk of war on the continent has been declared the highest it\u2019s ever been, while data has shown the mighty US economy pulling even further ahead of its European counterpart.\nAs a rapid rise in military spending across Europe looks increasingly likely, could it also give the region\u2019s economy a much-needed shot in the arm, making Europeans both safer and richer?\nThat depends on where the money comes from \u2014 taxes or borrowing \u2014 and how the money is spent \u2014 on imported weapons or, rather, the kind of home-grown innovation that produced the life-savingthree-point seat belt, for example.\n\u201cIncreased defense spending could significantly boost Europe\u2019s economic growth and industrial base if outlays are targeted at high-tech, regionally made armaments,\u201d the Kiel Institute, an economic think tank in Germany,saidrecently.\nRelated videoEU chief: \u2018We urgently have to rearm Europe\u2019\nEuropean nations are facing up tothe once-unthinkable prospect of defending themselves in a potential future conflict without the help of the United States.\nLast month, US Defense Secretary Pete HegsethurgedEurope to take \u201cresponsibility\u201d for its own security. The US remains committed to NATO, he said, but will \u201cno longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency.\u201d Distancing itself even further from Europe, the Trump administration then held talks with Moscow to explore ending the war in Ukraine \u2014 without inviting officials from either the European Union or Ukraine.\nAmerica\u2019s pullback from Europe comes against the backdrop of the three-year-old conflict in Ukraine, right on the EU\u2019s doorstep. \u201cNever has the risk of a war on the European continent, in the European Union, been so high,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said in a radio interview this week, chiming withsimilar warningselsewhere.\nEuropean and American economies are also diverging. Last year, the 27-nation-strong EU economy \u2014 the second-largest in the world, based on World Bankdata\u2014 grew only 0.9% compared with a 2.8% rise across the pond, according to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. And gross domestic product per capita, a common measure of living standards, is twice as high in the US as in the EU.\nA special summit of EU leaders Thursday may help with both predicaments. They are meeting to discuss military spending, as well as their support for Ukraine. EU nations spent about1.9%of their combined GDP on defense last year but there have been recent calls from within Europe and the US for much more.\n\u201cThere is a sense of urgency at the moment that was not there two, three years ago, before the Ukraine war,\u201d Roberto Cingolani, chief executive of Leonardo, a top European defense company, told CNN in January. \u201cAnd the sense of urgency (is) to find solutions that are continental solutions.\u201d\nIt is indeed homegrown weapons and advanced military technologies that hold one of the keys to translating higher government spending on defense into a meaningful economic boost, experts say.\nThe reason is twofold. Firstly, ordering weapons from local firms, rather than mostly importing them as the EU has been doing, would increase domestic production, lifting GDP, as well as create jobs, with the salaries spent in the European economy.\nSecondly, when cutting-edge military equipment is designed locally, the knowledge gained in the process spreads locally too, rather than staying abroad, generating so-called technological spillovers across the economy.\n\u201cHistorically, the defense sector has been the origin of diverse innovation that has now been mainstreamed in the civilian world,\u201d Mario Draghi, a former European Central Bank president and Italian prime minister, wrote in alandmark reporton European competitiveness released in September.\nDraghi pointed to numerous examples, including the internet, GPS positioning, satellite imaging, the ubiquitous three-point seat belt \u2014 derived from harnesses designed for military jet pilots \u2014 and the early growth in the 1950s and 60s of what became known as Silicon Valley, supported by government investment in defense.\nAnother example, from more recent history, illustrates broader productivity improvements that can follow from higher military spending. An increase in military research and development in the US after the 9\/11 attacks led to a \u201csignificant\u201d rise in productivity in the overall economy, according toresearchpublished in January, based on aworking paperfrom the National Bureau of Economic Research.\nAndproductivity growthmatters, as it\u2019s what drives improvements in living standards over the long run.\nBuilding up defense industry capacity will take time and so Europe will probably continue to rely on imports for the bulk of its military needs in the short term. That initial period will last about five years, with at least another five needed to achieve self-sufficiency, Frank Gill, a sovereign credit analyst at S&P Global Ratings, told CNN.\nBut even with imports, \u201cit\u2019s not necessarily a zero (economic) effect,\u201d argued Ethan Ilzetzki, an economics professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who wrote areportfor the Kiel Institute on the economic consequences of defense build-ups, published last month.\nHe said Poland, for instance, had imported a lot of military aircraft since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThis has also led to construction of airfields, which creates employment, which creates economic activity,\u201d he told CNN.\nAnother way to ensure higher defense spending generates economic growth is to contract local companies that make products that can be used both for military and civilian purposes \u2014 something that\u2019s currently more common in the US than Europe \u2014 rather than choosing specialized defense suppliers.\nTechnological advances by \u201cdual-use\u201d defense contractors spread quickly into the private economy, the Kiel Institute said in a press release on Ilzetzki\u2019s study.\nEurope\u2019sdefense industry is also different from its US counterpart in how fragmented it is, split along national lines.\n\u201cNational defense procurement (in Europe) favors national champions rather than seeking economies of scale and efficiency,\u201d S&P said in areportlast month, co-authored by Gill. \u201cFurther inefficiencies arise from Europe\u2019s excessive diversity of weapons systems.\u201d\nAll big countries in Europe tend to develop their own military aircraft, their own tank, their own warship, noted Cingolani at Leonardo. This means they are not as fast at designing and making new military equipment as they would be if the EU operated as a single entity, he suggested.\nPooling resources would help European nations move away from reliance on defense imports sooner, Gill told CNN. That, in turn, would usher in the positive economic side-effects of domestic weapons production.\nThose effects could be large. Ilzetzki has estimated that raising defense spending from 2% to 3.5% of GDP and shifting to domestically designed and made weapons could translate into a boost to Europe\u2019s economic output of about 1%.\nThat benefit won\u2019t materialize, however, if the higher spending is financed with tax hikes rather than government borrowing, Ilzetzki wrote in his report.\nJack Allen-Reynolds, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, agrees. \u201cIf governments cut spending in other areas or raise taxes, there might not be much of an overall fiscal stimulus,\u201d he wrote in a note last month.\nMore borrowing does appear to be on the cards. On Tuesday, the head of the EU\u2019s executiveunveiled a planto enable governments to borrow more to increase their defense spending, as well as military support for Kyiv. And the parties hoping to form Germany\u2019s next government agreed tooverhaul borrowing rulesto inject more money into the military, although this must still be approved by parliament.\nSome economists are skeptical about the scale of the potential economic uplift from higher defense spending in Europe.\nClaus Vistesen at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a recent note that the splurge \u201cis unlikely to be the fiscal panacea that markets and many observers are hoping for,\u201d noting that building up the region\u2019s defense industry would take time.\nBut, according to Ilzetzki, Europe can afford to pace itself.\n\u201cHopefully, war in Europe, aside from the war in Ukraine, is not imminent, and so there is a little time for Europe to do this right and plan for the future,\u201d he told CNN.\nCNN\u2019s Joseph Ataman in Paris and Niamh Kennedy in London contributed to this article.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/03\/06\/business\/europe-military-spending-economic-growth-intl","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
{"title":"Trump\u2019s tariffs are bigger than his tax cuts for most Americans","date":"2025-09-15","body":"A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for freehere.\nRepublicans and President Donald Trump want credit for what he has called \u201cthe largest tax cut in the history of our country\u201d for the income tax cuts in his One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\nDemocrats and free trade advocates have said Trump\u2019s tariff policy, which placed levies on most imported goods from around the world, is one of the largesttax hikesin history.\nBoth claims are debatable, but for most Americans how tariffs and tax cuts will affect their daily lives is a highly relevant question.\nThe answers are hard to find and nuanced. But the bottom line, according to calculations by the Yale Budget Lab, is that American households could pay $2,300 more, on average, as result of the current tariff policy, nearly three times the average roughly $800 benefit from the OBBBA\u2019s new tax provisions.\n\u201cFor households as a whole, the total tax increase they\u2019ll feel from tariffs is larger than the total tax cut they\u2019ll feel from the new provisions in the Republican tax package,\u201d said John Ricco, the lab\u2019s associate director of policy analysis.\nThere are multiple variables that complicate things.\nFirst, tariffs have not yet sparked inflation on the level that many economists have predicted \u2014 although it isticking up. There\u2019s evidence that some of the impact from tariffscould be delayed,and much of the president\u2019s tariff policy has only recentlykicked in. Plus, the US economy is massive and decentralized and there are many factors beyond tariffs and taxes at play.\nTrump and Republicans have said the tax cuts are much larger than the tariffs, an argument that sidesteps the reality that the bulk of the tax cuts may not be noticed by many Americans. Rather than enact entirely new tax cuts, much of what the bill does is make permanent individual tax cuts that were passed as temporary policy during Trump\u2019s first term.\nPlus, specific measures like a temporary reprieve for taxes on tips will only help slivers of the workforce. The tax bill also includes cuts to the social safety net likefood assistanceandMedicaid, with the expectation that millions of people will lose these benefits, affecting their quality of life and financial resources.\nEven before those cuts, the cost burden of tariffs is expected to push hundreds of thousands of Americans into poverty next year, according to aseparate Yale analysis.\nTariffs amount to a national sales tax on imported goods, although the rate of tariffs varies by country and continues to change. Their impact could likewise evolve if, as Trump promises, they kickstart a US manufacturing renaissance.\nOne detailed comparison of how tariffs and tax cuts will affect Americans comes from the Yale Budget Lab, which concluded in a recent analysis that only those highest on the income ladder will come out ahead over the next decade when tariffs are put alongside tax cuts.\nThe top 10% of households, those who on average are making $518,000 per year, will pay about $13,600 less in taxes, according to Yale\u2019s analysis. They\u2019ll have to spend nearly $5,450 more, on average, because of tariff-fueled price increases.\nThat combined effect of tariffs and tax increases will net out to an income boost of about $8,200, or 1.6%, according to Yale.\nMiddle-income households, who on average are making between about $105,000 to $122,000, will see their average $1,200 tax cut more than offset by a $2,200 cumulative tariff price hike, in the Yale analysis.\nThose who make the least will be hurt the most. The bottom 10% will see their average annual income drop by almost $2,600, or 6.6%, the lab found. They\u2019ll take an average $1,350 hit to their wallets from tariffs coupled with a roughly $1,200 hit, on average, from the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d largely because the Republican package slashed spending on the nation\u2019s safety net to pay for part of the tax breaks. These folks have an average income of just under $39,000.\nPlus, while the higher cost of goods from tariffs affects every household, it will disproportionately hurt lower-income consumers because they spend a higher share of their income than the wealthy do, Ricco said.\nThat impact is clear from a separate report Yale issued in early September on Trump\u2019s tariff policies. It showed that while the wealthiest Americans will lose nearly $5,250 in disposable income in 2027 because of higher prices, that only amounts to only 1% of their income.\nBy contrast, tariffs will cut more than $1,300 out of the income of the bottom 10%, but that accounts for 3.5% of their disposable income, Yale found.\nThe real-world effect of the new tax and spending cut bill will be further muted by the fact that most of the tax cuts are extensions of tax cuts that would have expired rather than new tax cuts.\nLooking only at the new measures in the package, including the temporary elimination of taxes on some tips and overtime, the enhanced deduction for senior citizens and the beefed-up child tax credit, Americans will get an $800 break on their taxes in coming years, according to Yale. If extending the expiring cuts is added in, the average tax cut rises to $3,000.\nDifferent research groups and think tanks use different calculations to gauge tax cuts compared to tariffs, but their bottom-line assessments are the same.\n\u201cTax cuts are higher for higher-income people, whereas tariffs have the opposite effects; they are much more evenly distributed,\u201d said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. That means they will hit lower income Americans harder.\nWhile the tariffs, as currently constructed, will outweigh the tax cuts for most Americans, it\u2019s also important to look at how the two contrasting tax policies will affect the country\u2019s bottom line.\nThe beefed-up tariffs are projected to lower the federal deficit by $3.3 trillion over the 2025 to 2035 period and to reduce interest costs by an additional roughly $700 billion, for a total impact of $4 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s latest estimate, which looked at tariffs imposed as of August 19.\nThe GOP tax and spending cuts package is expected to increase the federal debt by an estimated $4.1 trillion or so between 2025 and 2034, more than Trump\u2019s tariffs are forecast to bring in. It is expected to increase the deficit by $3.4 trillion and add roughly $718 billion in interest costs.\nAdam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian-leaning CATO Institute, said even if the tariffs end up canceling out the impacts of the tax cuts, the effects of the two policies could make the country more unequal.\nThe tax cuts are \u201criddled with special interest carveouts that treat similarly situated Americans with vastly different tax systems.\u201d Consider the increased state and local tax deductions for many East Coast homeowners, new deductions for oil and gas companies, whalers in Alaska and rum producers in Louisiana,among others.\nThe same is true of tariffs, he said, which will hit some industries harder than others.\n\u201cTogether, these two changes mean we are moving toward a far more unequal and unstable fiscal system that trades durable reform for lumpy, distortionary breaks and levies that undermine long-run stability and fairness,\u201d he said.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/15\/politics\/tariffs-tax-cuts-trump-households-deficit-analysis","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Biden\u2019s economic legacy: Historic wage gains, investment and job growth but marred by inflation","date":"2025-01-19","body":"President Joe Biden will leave the White House with a strong economy, historic gains in the job market, a foundation for future manufacturing growth, and having brought downdecades-highinflationwithouttriggering a recession.\nThose feats, economists say, are even more impressive considering the nation was deep in the throes of adeadly, economy-scarring pandemicwhen Biden took office.\nHis legacy will also includehigher national debt, awider trade deficitand steeper costs forhousing, health care, higher education and child care.\n\u201c[The $36 trillion national debt] is a significant burden for future economic growth, a significant burden for the well-being of our children and grandchildren, because it\u2019s a big, big sword hanging over them,\u201d Andreas Hauskrecht, clinical professor of business economics and public policy at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business. \u201cAnd in that regard, my evaluation of the Biden administration is fiscally irresponsible. Am I saying [President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s first] administration was better? No. Am I saying I think the new Trump 2.0 will be better? No. But when I look at Biden\u2019s fiscal record, he failed the class.\u201d\nAnd then there\u2019sthe high cost of living.\nWhile most economists agree that Biden wasnot to blame for inflation, the yearslong bout of sharp-rising priceshit Americans hardand, ultimately, cast a thick cloud over Biden\u2019s presidency thatcarried through to the November election.\nEconomic cycles don\u2019t begin or end with presidential administrations. Also, economic data can be highly influenced by events outside of a president\u2019s control, such as war or extreme weather \u2014or a globalpandemic and its aftereffects.\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s a look at how key metrics fared during Biden\u2019s presidency.\nThe labor market during the Biden administration was nothing short of historic.\nThrough December,the US economy added jobs for 48 consecutive months, tying the second-longest period of employment expansion on record, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data that goes back to 1939.\nHe\u2019s the first US president to oversee monthly job gains for the entirety of his presidency. (Caveats: President Barack Obama did not have any monthly job losses during his second term; also, labor market data issubject to revisionas more complete information becomes available).\nAs it stands now, the US economy added 16.6 million from February 2021 (the first full month of Biden\u2019s presidency) through December 2024, BLS data shows.\nRelated articleJob growth skyrocketed in December, boosting one of the strongest labor markets in US history\nThere are some pandemic effects: The US lost nearly 22 million jobs in March and April of 2020. Following massive relief and recovery measures, the US added more than 12 million jobs from May to December 2020.\nInJune 2022, the US surpassed its pre-pandemic employment totals. Since then, the economy has added 7.6 million jobs, or nearly 240,000 jobs per month, BLS data shows. Since 1939, monthly job gains have averaged 125,000.\nThe recent years\u2019 surge inimmigration has been creditedwith cooling a hot labor market, contributing to higher productivity and easing a structural decline in native-born workers (via low birth rates and an aging population).\nAs job gains soared, the unemployment rate hit a nearly 54-year low of 3.4% in January 2023. To be fair, the nation\u2019s jobless rate hit a half-century low of 3.5% duringfirst Trump administration; but when Biden entered office, the unemployment rate was 6.8%.\nHowever, the historic significance extends beyond the low rate. During Biden\u2019s time in office, the jobless rate was under 4% for 27 months, a streak not seen since Lyndon B. Johnson was in office, back in the mid-1960s.\n\u201cWhen you get low unemployment, the people who benefit are disproportionately those at the bottom end of the labor market,\u201dincluding marginalized groupssuch as Black workers, Hispanic workers, and people with disabilities, Dean Baker, economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CNN.\nWage and employment gaps between Black and White workers narrowed to record levels during Biden\u2019s presidency, Baker noted. Also, the Black unemployment rate hit an all-time low of 4.8% in April 2023, BLS data shows.\nBiden will hand off an economy that continues to grow at a healthy clip. Real Gross Domestic Product, the broadest measure of economic output, expanded at anannualized rate of 3.1%during the third quarter of last year, according to the most recent data available from the Commerce Department.\nWhat\u2019s kept the economy churning has been strong consumer spending, even in the face of high inflation and high interest rates meant to counter those price hikes. Consumers have continued to power the economy, helped by a sturdy labor market; a steady stream of stronger-than-typical wage gains; and, in some cases, financial buffers accumulated during the pandemic \u201crefinancing boom.\u201d\nHouseholddebt has grown, but so have incomes; however, the number of consumers defaulting on their credit cards and car loans has been on the rise during the past year, an indication that Americans are increasingly strained.\nWages have been growing faster than inflation for 19 months running; however, they remain just below pre-pandemic levels.\nReal GDP growth and GDP per capita are both running at their fastest pace during a presidential administration transition since 2000, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\nHigh inflation was Biden\u2019s (and, ultimately, presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019)Waterloo.\nThe bout of high inflation was a once-in-a-generation event that spun out of a once-in-a-century pandemic and was not unique to the US. As such, it\u2019s not fair for Biden to shoulder the full blame, CEPR\u2019s Baker said.\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t blame the governor of Florida because they lost all this housing in a hurricane, that\u2019d just be silly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say the same here.\u201d\nStill, in the cadre of causes (which includesupply chain snarls, shifts in demand and spending patterns andRussia\u2019swar in Ukraine) some prominent economists have said the massive fiscal packages passed underTrumpandBidenstoked demand.\nRegardless, prices for almost everything rose substantially, weighing heavily on Americans, especially those who live paycheck to paycheck.\nPrices of commonly purchased goods and servicesare 20.5% higherthan they were in February 2021, the first full month Biden was in office, according to BLS Consumer Price Index data through December. You\u2019d have to go back to 1983 to have a bigger increase over a comparable period.\nGrocery prices are 22.6% higher than they were in February 2021, the highest rate since 1982 for a similar period, data shows.\nTo counter fast-rising prices, the Federal Reserve embarked on one of themost aggressive monetary-tightening policiesin recent history, bringing interest rates to a 23-year high at one point.\nThe painfully high interest rates filtered through the economy in a calculated effort to squelch demand, but further exacerbated the housing affordability problem in the US. Housing cost concerns pre-date Biden, but theissues deepenedduring the past four years, due to the pandemic, inflation and interest rates.\nAs of the third quarter of 2024, the median sales price of a single-family home was $420,400, Census data shows. That\u2019s 18% higher than in the first quarter of 2021,a price spike driven by an unprecedented surgein activity during the pandemic and further fueled by low interest rates during the lockdown. The median sales price rose 5% during the comparable time frame in the first Trump administration.\nThe average rate on a standard 30-year fixed mortgagewas 7.04% last week, according to Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates are expected to staystuck above 6%during the next two years.\nA shortage of available homes has been a longstanding issue for the housing market. Freddie Mac estimates the shortfall at 3.7 million units. Housing inventory did increase in 2024; plus, the Biden administrationannounced last weekincreased funding to build more housing as well as shore up protections for renters.\nThecornerstone of Biden\u2019s legacyis a series of sweeping legislative wins designed to pour funding into rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure, expanding clean technology capacity and bolstering domestic manufacturing in critical areas like chip production. Taken together, the laws are designed to reshape key pillars of the US economy over the next decade.\nTaken in isolation, each law is designed to deploy significant federal resources: The American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 economic relief packagesigned in March 2021; the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; the CHIPS and Science Act, a $200 billion law to boost American chip manufacturing; and theInflation Reduction Act, a $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill.\nTogether, that\u2019s more than $4 trillion of investment, spending and tax credits.\nSome of the economic and job gainshave been immediate, and others will come to fruition during the coming years.\n\u201cFactory construction just went through the roof \u2026 we\u2019re building at twice the rate that we were before the pandemic, which is incredible,\u201d Baker said. \u201cSome of those factories are now open, but others will be opening over the course of this year and next, and those will be jobs that I\u2019m sure Donald Trump will be very happy to take credit for; but if you don\u2019t have the factories, you don\u2019t have the jobs. And it was the Biden administration that got the factories built.\u201d\nAcross the Biden era, US stocks posted strong gains, fattening retirement accounts and providing hefty returns for investors. From Biden\u2019s inauguration on January 20, 2021, to January 16, 2025, the S&P 500 had a total return (including dividends) of 63.77%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nDuring the last two years of the Biden presidency, the S&P 500 posted its first back-to-back annual gains of over 20% since the late 1990s.\nThe Dow also surged. After losing 8.78% in 2022, the blue-chip index gained 13.7% in 2023 and 12.88% in 2024, closing above 45,000 for the first time ever in December 2024.\nWhile the president\u2019s agenda can certainly have an influence on the economy, the US stock market is a beast of its own and does not move based on who is in office.\nYet the stock market is often considered a barometer of the health of the economy, and its performance during a presidential term can influence perceptions of success or failure.\nHistory shows that markets oftenperform wellunder Democrat presidents, and that proved again to be true during Biden\u2019s presidency.\nCNN\u2019s John Towfighi, Daniel Dale, Bryan Mena, Betsy Klein and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/19\/economy\/us-biden-economic-legacy","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"A property tax revolt is spreading \u2014 with help from key conservatives","date":"2025-09-07","body":"With real estate prices climbing and household budgets under strain, a once-fringe push to eliminate property taxes is drawing new energy \u2014 and the backing of high-profile conservative figures.\nRepublican firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgiarecently arguedfor making it a national priority. Billionaire Elon Musk has likened property taxes to \u201ca de facto lease from the government\u201d that should be abolished. And in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a once and possible future presidential contender, has vowed to move his state in that direction.\n\u201cIf you own your home, to truly own it, you have to own it free and clear of the government,\u201d DeSantis said Tuesday.\nFor decades, property taxes have underwritten the basic functions of local government \u2014 schools, parks, roads, police and fire departments, trash collection. But as home values have surged, tax bills have ballooned in tandem, fueling what David Schleicher, a Yale professor of local government, described as a \u201cproperty tax revolt\u201d shaking cities and states alike.\n\u201cThis is a really big trend that is below the radar because it doesn\u2019t involve President Trump,\u201d Schleicher said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t need fireworks to announce itself. It\u2019s already changing our relationship with government and how schools work and property markets.\u201d\nThe frustration is cutting across partisan lines. Last year, voters in nine states approved referendums to cap or curb rising assessments, from tying bills to inflation in Georgia to New Mexico and Colorado expanding tax exemptions for veterans who own homes there. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Texas, Indiana, New Jersey, New York and elsewhere have approved tens of billions of dollars in property tax relief over the past 18 months.\nTo some, though, such measures fall short. Grassroots campaigns in Michigan and Ohio are now gathering signatures for ballot initiatives that would abolish property taxes altogether. In Texas, Republican state Rep. Brian Harrison has proposed a state constitutional amendment to end them there by 2031.\n\u201cNever-ending property taxes are unethical, immoral and incompatible with private property rights,\u201d Harrison said, \u201cand need to be thrown to the ash heap of history.\u201d\nCritics warn that eliminating property taxes would devastate local budgets. The levy accounts for 70% of what cities and counties collect nationwide, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. In Florida alone, property taxes amounted to about $60 billion last year, according to the state Department of Revenue.\nJared Walczak, the vice president of State Projects at the Tax Foundation, said that while angst over property taxes is justified, few communities could overcome their elimination. Rural and residential areas lack the retail base to rely on sales tax, and most local governments are barred from taxing income, he said. That would leave states to collect and distribute money through new levies, stripping power from local officials.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not responsible,\u201d Walczak said. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous amount to offset.\u201d\nEven DeSantis, who is exploring a 2026 ballot measure to phase out property taxes on homes, has acknowledged Florida may be uniquely positioned because of its robust tourism taxes and revenue collected on second homes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only state that can probably pull this off,\u201d DeSantis said, though he has yet to unveil a detailed plan.\nFor some advocates of the idea, finding a way to pay for programs and services is a problem for others to solve. Harrison, who downplayed the financial pain, nevertheless made clear: \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a dollar-for-dollar replacement. I want to cut government.\u201d\nIn Ohio, Brian Massie, who leads a citizens group pushing to abolish property taxes, suggested charging fees for fire departments calls, adding more toll roads and selling annual park and library passes. But he said those concerned about the unknown should be troubled by the status quo\u2019s effect on struggling families and seniors on fixed incomes.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent $100,000 in property taxes for a school I\u2019ve never used,\u201d Massie said. \u201cYou can\u2019t continue to suck the lifeblood out of the community.\u201d\nThe moment recalls anti-tax movements from a half-century ago, when homeowner anger over rising costs produced a wave of ballot initiatives, including California\u2019s Proposition 13, which sharply capped property taxes.\nThe belief that property should never be taxed has long lingered at the margins of American politics. But a post-pandemic surge in home values has transformed it from a grievance bubbling beneath the surface into a cause that is beginning to reshape tax debates and Republican politics.\nPennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who lost a bid for governor in 2022 and has hinted at another campaign in 2026, proposed a constitutional amendment that would eliminate school property taxes in his state. Rep. Byron Donalds, the Trump-backed candidate to succeed DeSantis as Florida governor,told conservative podcaster Benny Johnsonearlier this year he would \u201cdefinitely be in favor\u201d of eliminating property taxes.\nIn Ohio, Republican Vivek Ramaswamy, a presidential candidate in 2024, launched his campaign for governor with a speech declaring \u201cwe need to bring down property taxes in this state immediately \u2014 eventually down to zero.\u201d He has since softened his stance, saying he would eliminate income taxes and \u201ccap\u201d property taxes, though his campaign would not explain the shift.\nThe movement has largely grown on grassroots support and without major financial backing, though that could be changing. Club for Growth, a conservative group funded in part by billionaire GOP donors Jeff Yass and Richard Uihlein, has been discussing the issue with lawmakers and gubernatorial candidates and is closely tracking its rise, a person with knowledge of the organization\u2019s planning told CNN.\n\u201cConservatives who oppose cutting property taxes so they can fund big government are RINOs we will hold accountable,\u201d Club for Growth president David McIntosh told CNN in a statement supporting efforts to eliminate the tax.\nDespite the momentum, the cause suffered a considerable setback last year in North Dakota. There, an unusual coalition of labor groups, progressive organizations, business leaders and both Republicans and Democrats banded together to defeat a ballot initiative that would have ended property taxes in the state. The measure was opposed by then-Gov. Doug Burgum, now the secretary of the interior, as well as fellow Republican Kelly Armstrong, who succeeded him.\nBy a two-to-one margin North Dakotans rejected the referendum \u2014 about the same share of voters who backed Trump in the state.\nChad Oban, a Democratic operative who led the opposition campaign, said he assumed such a decisive defeat in a deeply conservative state would halt the movement. Watching it spread now, he warned leaders in other states not to ignore the anger.\n\u201cPeople are upset about property taxes and it\u2019s not because they\u2019re unreasonable,\u201d Oban said. \u201cIf they get pushed too hard, eventually a state is going to pass this. And then, oh my.\u201d","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/09\/07\/politics\/property-taxes-abolish-florida-texas","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump admin hones strategy to sell voters on massive agenda law: Focus on tax cuts","date":"2025-08-21","body":"President Donald Trump loves to boast about the sprawling size and scope of his domestic policy law. But the White House\u2019s plan to sell voters on his signature, broadly unpopular legislation increasingly relies on the appeal of a single issue: Lower taxes.\nTrump administration officials have narrowed their rhetoric since passing the multitrillion-dollar bill, focusing on a small handful of tax provisions that they believe will resonate with Americans in the run-up to next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nThe more focused messaging effort represents a significant departure from the White House\u2019s stance earlier this year, when Trump insisted on passing as wide-ranging a package as possible so that \u201cthere\u2019s something for everyone.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to see why. The tax policies \u2014 including deeper cuts for individuals and businesses and the elimination of certain taxes on tips and overtime \u2014 are among the most popular elements of a law that has so far proven decidedly unpopular as a whole. And as White House aides and allies try to bolster the perception of Trump\u2019s central legislative accomplishment ahead of the midterm elections, they\u2019re hoping that the financial benefits that could show up as early as next year will eventually outweigh voters\u2019 concerns about the law\u2019s broader impact on health care and more.\n\u201cYes, it is a big, beautiful bill \u2014 but the tax digest next year says it\u2019s going to save the average Georgian $3,600 on their income tax,\u201d said Bruce LeVell, a longtime Trump ally and Georgia businessman. \u201cIt\u2019s a great thing to sell to the American people to make sure they\u2019re very clear how this is going to impact their wallets.\u201d\nVice President JD Vance amplified the tax-specific appeal during a visit to Georgia on Thursday, celebrating the \u201cbig fat tax cut\u201d that he vowed working-class people would received as a result of the legislation.\n\u201cNo matter where you are in this country, if you\u2019re working hard and play by the rules, you ought to have a government that stands up for you,\u201d Vance said in a speech at an industrial refrigeration manufacturing facility outside Atlanta. \u201cThat\u2019s why we had the biggest tax cut for families this country\u2019s ever seen.\u201d\nThe event was the second stop in a tour of battleground states and districts that Vance plans to continue into the fall. After an initial speech on the new law in Pennsylvania that touched on a range of themes, including immigration and trade, Vance on Thursday focused much of his remarks on the collection of provisions he cast as \u201cworking families tax cuts.\u201d\nThe vice president also took direct aim at vulnerable Georgia Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, criticizing him for voting against the broader domestic policy law and pointing to it as evidence of his opposition to Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\u201cIn about a year, you\u2019re not going to be able to turn on the television without Sen. Jon Ossoff pretending that he supported the working families tax cut,\u201d Vance said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to pretend to be a reasonable moderate.\u201d\nThe tax emphasis approach, Republicans hope, will help shift voters\u2019 focus toward the financial issues that that are typically advantageous for the GOP, and away from topics like health care that have consistently dragged the party down in past election cycles.\nThe effort to message the legislation primarily as a tax bill benefiting working-class voters grew out of workshopping sessions across the Republican Party, aides and GOP operatives said. Administration officials and lawmakers sifted through early polling as they tried to plot a path toward keeping control of Congress next November.\nWhile Republicans across the country are expected to tailor their electoral messages to their specific constituencies \u2014 touting immigration or agriculture provisions that may have outsized impact in some districts, for example \u2014 Trump allies have seized on taxes as the issue with the broadest appeal.\nThat focus also carries a secondary benefit: Some of the tax provisions kick in immediately, meaning voters may feel the financial impact early next year, far enough before the midterms for it to potentially influence their vote.\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a good shot of adrenaline,\u201d said LeVell. \u201cSo why not get that message out there in some of the key battleground states?\u201d\nIn a statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the administration had long championed the tax cuts and that they were one of several major elements that officials planned to promote in the coming months.\n\u201cOf course the Administration will continue highlighting this win, as we always have,\u201d she said. \u201cLuckily, there are no shortage of wins for the American people in the One Big Beautiful Bill, from modernizing our air traffic control systems to providing funding to secure our Southern Border.\u201d\nStill, Republicans will need that messaging to take hold quickly if they hope to dig out of the sizable polling deficit that they face on their domestic agenda law. Onerecent Pew Research Center surveyshowed just 32% of Americans approve of the law \u2014 and only a quarter believed it would have a mostly positive impact on their families.\nPerhaps more alarmingly, just six in 10 Republicans said they approved of the law, even as GOP voters have remained unflinchingly behind Trump and his presidency.\nDemocratic lawmakers and strategists have cast the massive law as a political gift, pointing to the sagging polls and voters\u2019 persistent worries about its sweeping health care cuts and projections that it will further add to the deficit. Ahead of Vance\u2019s arrival, Ossoff called the vice president\u2019s visit a \u201cdamage control mission,\u201d telling reporters that \u201cdefunding hospitals and nursing homes to cut taxes for the wealthiest people in the country is not popular here in Georgia.\u201d\nVance on Thursday downplayed the health care concerns, insisting that \u201cthe only people who are going to lose access to health care are illegal aliens.\u201d The law, which imposes new work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries and tightens the program\u2019s eligibility rules, isprojected to leaveroughly 10 million more people without insurance over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nAs for the \u201cworking families\u201d tax rhetoric, Democrats argued that most of the tax relief will benefit the wealthiest Americans \u2014 and questioned whether provisions like \u201cno tax on tips\u201d that only affect a tiny slice of workers will resonate with a broader electorate that could face rising costs for health care, electricity and other necessities. Additionally, many middle-class households will only see a continued tax cut rather than an increase \u2014 not exactly a boon for GOP messaging.\n\u201cTake no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on car loans, and they make up about 3% of all the tax cuts in the entire bill,\u201d said Brendan Duke, the senior director for federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard for me to believe that millions of Americans are going to feel warm and vote based on those provisions if they don\u2019t get a dollar from them.\u201d\nGeorgia could serve as a pivotal proving ground for the White House\u2019s messaging offensive, with Ossoff\u2019s Senate seat emerging as a top target for Republicans trying to secure control of the chamber through 2028. The first-term senator narrowly won in a runoff in 2021 and is viewed as one of the most vulnerable Democrats next year.\nBut the GOP missed out on its preferred candidate after Gov. Brian Kemp decided against a bid, leading to a three-way primary that has already stoked tensions within the state party and Trump\u2019s broader orbit. Reps. Mike Collins and Buddy Carter, staunch Trump allies who both voted for the domestic policy bill, are vying for the Republican nomination alongside Derek Dooley, a former football coach closely aligned with Kemp.\nTrump has to yet to endorse in the race, and all three candidates attended Vance\u2019s speech on Thursday.\nBut Dooley\u2019s sudden entrance into the race angered many Trump allies who had sought to quickly consolidate support behind Collins and shift the focus to the general election, said one GOP operative familiar with the dynamics who was granted anonymity to describe private discussions. Dooley\u2019s candidacy also concerned others in the state who are still hoping to avoid a proxy battle between Trump and Kemp \u2014 the governor who rebuffed Trump\u2019s efforts in 2020 to overturn Georgia\u2019s election result.\nInstead, Republicans are now bracing for a drawn-out primary contest that grants Ossoff and Democrats more time to try to tie Trump to the least popular parts of his signature legislation. And if the White House and its allies can\u2019t mount a counteroffensive effective enough to beat Ossoff, they worry it could end up spelling trouble across the midterm map.\n\u201cRepublicans who think he\u2019s going to be easy to beat in a midterm, with our party in the White House, are crazy,\u201d the GOP operative said, adding that the path gets even more difficult if Americans don\u2019t feel better off financially. \u201cYou can\u2019t go tell Americans everything\u2019s great if they can\u2019t afford their bills.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/08\/21\/politics\/trump-vance-tax-law-georgia-election","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Trump is counting on economic growth to offset tax cuts. But his \u2018big, beautiful bill\u2019 likely wouldn\u2019t deliver, experts say","date":"2025-06-17","body":"President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are promising that theirsweeping tax and spending cuts packagewill usher in an era of historic economic growth.\n\u201cThis is going to be jet fuel,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d earlier this month. \u201cThe reason we call it the Big, Beautiful Bill is because it is a tremendous pro-growth package entwined in this legislation that is going to make everybody\u2019s incomes go up.\u201d\nBut a multitude of economic experts across the ideological spectrum doubt that\u2019s going to happen. In fact, many argue that the Trump agenda megabill that narrowly passed the House last month would provide even less economic oomph than his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2013 and the jury is still out on how much economic growth that earlier tax cut package spurred.\nRelated articleHow the government makes a $3.8 trillion educated guess\nWhile independent estimates vary somewhat, most find that the House-passed package would only give a small nudge to economic growth and fail to offset its trillions of dollars of tax cuts.\nThe reason: The \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d wouldn\u2019t provide substantial long-term corporate tax relief, which drives economic expansion.\nThe Senate version, a portion of whichwas released Monday, would make several business tax provisions permanent, which would increase the bill\u2019s economic growth potential but also its cost. But the two chambers would still need to hammer out their differences on these and other provisions. And growth estimates for the Senate bill have yet to be released.\nThe megabill\u2019s main focus is to extend the roughly $4 trillion in TCJA individual tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of this year. The House-passed package would also expand some of the measures, such as a four-year enhancement to the child tax credit, and aims to fulfill several of Trump\u2019s campaign promises, including temporarily eliminating taxes on tips, overtime and auto loan interest.\nOn the corporate tax side, the package would restore a tax break from the 2017 package that allowed businesses to fully write off the cost of equipment in the first year it was purchased. The incentive has been phasing out since 2023.\nAlso, the legislation would once again allow businesses to write off the cost of research and development in the year it was incurred. The TCJA required that companies deduct those expenses over five years, starting in 2022.\nRelated articleHouse GOP \u2018big, beautiful bill\u2019 would increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion, CBO says\nThe two provisions would expire after 2029.\nThe bill would also allow companies to immediately deduct the cost of constructing or making improvements to certain types of buildings, including manufacturing plants, through 2028.\nThese corporate tax breaks would prompt businesses to invest and expand in the next few years, but the incentives are temporary and won\u2019t prompt long-term economic growth, said Will McBride, the Tax Foundation\u2019s chief economist.\nWhat\u2019s missing is the massive business tax break \u2013 the permanent reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% \u2013 contained in the TCJA, which some experts argue drove the economic growth in that package.\nAccording to the right-leaning Tax Foundation, the tax provisions in the House-approved bill would boost the economy 0.8% over about three decades \u2013 compared to its estimate of 1.7% for the 2017 bill. Increased revenue from economic growth would offset about 22% of the current bill\u2019s tax cuts.\nStill, the package would increase the federal budget deficit by $1.7 trillion over 10 years, even taking its roughly $1.5 trillion in spending cuts into account.\n\u201cWe look at the bill and kind of shrug our shoulders and say, \u2018You could have done better on growth\u2019,\u201d said Daniel Bunn, the foundation\u2019s president.\nSimilarly, the Penn Wharton Budget Model forecasts that the overall House bill would give a 0.4% boost to the economy by 2034, but the deficit would grow by $3.2 trillion over that period. Penn Wharton estimates that the deficit impact would increase when taking the economic effects into account because some lower-income households would reduce their hours worked to requalify for Medicaid coverage and some higher-income people would work less because of their gains from the bill\u2019s tax breaks.\nThe Trump administration argues that these independent analyses are wrong.\n\u201cSo called \u2018experts\u2019 panning The One, Big, Beautiful Bill, without a smidge of self-awareness, should remember that they made these same exact gloomy predictions about President Trump\u2019s tax cuts during his first term,\u201d Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said in a statement to CNN, adding that the TCJA \u201chelped usher in historic job, wage, investment, and economic growth.\u201d\nThe Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday that the House package would increase the deficit by $2.8 trillion between 2025 and 2034, after taking the economic effects into account. That compares to a separate CBO forecast that the bill would raise the deficit by $2.4 trillion over a decade, not accounting for economic growth.\nWhile the bill\u2019s tax and spending provisions would result in an additional $124 billion in revenue from economic growth, it would also increase interest costs by $441 billion because interest rates would be higher, the CBO found.\nOne way to boost the economic growth potential of the package would be to make the business tax breaks permanent, some experts say. The Senate Finance Committee version of the bill calls for making several of the provisions permanent.\nFor instance, the temporary corporate tax breaks for equipment and for research and development would cost $60 billion over a decade, but making them permanent would increase the price tag to $507 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimate, which was calculated prior to the Senate Finance Committee proposals were released.\nPenn Wharton forecasts that making permanent the temporary business tax provisions and other time-limited measures in the House bill would increase the deficit after taking the economic impact into account. Higher levels of federal debt can reduce incentives for private investment, which typically spurs more economic growth.\nProviding subsidies for new commitments is a much more efficient way to encourage growth than cutting the corporate rate since companies only get the benefit if they invest, said William Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n\u201cMaking the investment provisions permanent would be a pro-growth move relative to almost anything else in the bill,\u201d Gale said, though the increase in deficit and other measures in the legislation could negatively affect private investment.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/17\/politics\/big-beautiful-bill-tax-cuts","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"House Republicans unveil details of Trump tax plans","date":"2025-05-12","body":"House Republicans on Monday unveiled one of the most critical pieces of President Donald Trump\u2019sdomestic agenda: How it plans to spend trillions of dollars on tax breaks.\nThe long-awaited tax plans include some of Trump\u2019s big campaign promises, including scrapping federal taxes on tips, on overtime pay and on car loan interest. It\u2019s a big win for Trump, as is the name of the bill \u2014 \u201cThe One, Big, Beautiful Bill,\u201d adopting the president\u2019s moniker for the legislation.\nRelated articleWhat's in the House GOP's sweeping tax, spending cuts package\nAs expected, it also includes Trump\u2019s demand for a debt limit hike, which would cost a total of $4 trillion to punt the problem for another few years. Congress needs to raise the debt limitbefore its August recess to prevent defaultand Trump hopes to do so using this bill, rather than strike a deal with Democrats.\nThe bill includes dozens of tax extensions from Trump\u2019s 2017 tax bill. There\u2019s also one relatively new idea \u2013 a so-called \u201cMAGA\u201d savings account for kids under 18 years old. It\u2019s short for \u201cmoney account for growth and advancement,\u201d and would create a new, flexible type of tax-free savings account for kids.\nOne headache in the GOP it does not solve: The battle over state and local taxes. House Republicans\u2019 tax bill would triple the current cap on state and local taxes, from $10,000 to $30,000 per year, but is limited to people who are making $400,000 or less.\nRepublicans from high-tax states, such as New York, New Jersey and California, have already rejected this policy publicly and in private, though it\u2019s unclear how much leverage they have to change it before the final bill. Some of those GOP lawmakers have privately demanded a cap as large as $60,000.\nModerates within the GOP were quick to criticize the proposed Republican tax plan released Monday because of its SALT provisions.\nThe far-right flank also appeared far from sold.\n\u201cI remain open-minded because progress has been made based on our forceful efforts to force change. But we cannot continue down the path we\u2019ve been going down - and we will need SIGNIFICANT additional changes to garner my support,\u201d Rep.

Does the bill offer ANY transformative changes on Medicaid or otherwise?.. Does the bill fully repeal the IRA to stop the devastatingly bad projects being implemented in my district? \u2026Does the bill fix judicial abuses preventing implementation of the President\u2019s agenda to deport?\u201d\nNew York Republicans, including Reps. Elise Stefanik, Mike Lawler, Andrew Garbarino and Nick LaLota had already said last week that a $30,000 SALT cap was too low to win their support.\nPressed last week on a proposed $30,000 cap, LaLota said \u201chell no\u201d that wasn\u2019t acceptable.\nResponding Monday on X after seeing the proposed text, he said: \u201cStill a hell no.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Lauren Fox and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/05\/12\/politics\/house-gop-tax-plan-trump","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"Senate Republicans unveil plan for cuts to Medicaid and taxes in Trump agenda bill","date":"2025-06-16","body":"The GOP-ledSenate Finance Committee on Monday released itsproposal forPresident Donald Trump\u2019s agenda billthat calls for enacting sweeping cuts to Medicaid and preventing a multi-trillion dollar tax hike on Americans.\nThe committee would maintain many of the provisions contained in thelegislationthat the House narrowly approved last month, including making permanent essentially all the individual income tax cuts contained in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are set to expire at year\u2019s end, and institutingwork requirements in Medicaidfor the first time.\nBut the committee is calling for some notable changes to the package, including lowering the cap on state and local tax deductions, instituting deeper cuts to Medicaid, slowing the elimination of some clean energy tax credits andmaking permanent several business tax breaks and a beefed-up child tax credit.\nSenate committees are racing to release their versions of the \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d in hopes of passing their package next week so the two chambers can work out a final deal and send it to Trump by July 4.\nBut top Senate Republicans arerunning into some resistancefrom several key senators about the details of the bill, potentially complicating plans to deliver that package by their own deadline.\nIn the legislative text unveiled Monday, the Senate Finance Committee would permanently extend the current$10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, potentially blowing up a carefully constructed deal in the House to lift the cap on state and local deductions to $40,000 for married couples. However, the committee noted in a summary of its provisions that the cap is \u201cthe subject of continuing negotiations.\u201d\nThe $10,000 cap, which was instituted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was a major sticking point in the House negotiations. Speaker Mike Johnson worked out an agreement with GOP lawmakers from high-tax states to raise the cap to $40,000 for those making $500,000 or less.\nBut Senate Republicans have expressed disdain for the deal because of its price tag and because it primarily benefits taxpayers from blue states.\nRep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, issued a stern warning to Senate Republicans earlier on Monday: Any changes to pare back the deal, he said, would cause the bill to collapse in the House.\n\u201cAfter engaging in good faith negotiations, we were able to increase the cap on SALT from $10,000 to $40,000,\u201d Lawler said in a statement. \u201cThat is the deal, and I will not accept a penny less. If the Senate reduces the SALT number, I will vote NO, and the bill will fail in the House.\u201d\nRepublicans on the Senate Finance Committee are also calling for making permanent several tax breaks for businesses, including allowing companies to immediately deduct the cost of equipment and research and development in the year the expense was incurred. These are designed to enhance the economic growth potential of the package but would alsoincrease the cost.\nThe committee would also permanently beef up the child tax credit to $2,200, in contrast to the House, which would increase the credit to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028.\nAnd while the Senate committee would keepTrump\u2019s campaign promisesto eliminate taxes on tips and overtime, it would place caps on that relief \u2013- allowing tipped workers to deduct only up to $25,000 in tip income and limiting the deduction for overtime pay to $12,500 for a single worker. Those tax breaks would only be in place from 2025 through 2028, as in the House version.\nBut the Senate measure would provide a more generous deduction for senior citizens than the House bill: $6,000 versus $4,000. The provision would be in effect from 2025 through 2028 in both versions of the bill.\nIn a contentious move, the committee would cap most states\u2019 ability to levy provider taxes on certain health care providers \u2013 notably, hospitals \u2013 to 3.5% by 2031, down from the current 6% limit. However, that provision would only apply to the 40 states and the District of Columbia that have expanded Medicaid to low-income adults.\nStates that have not expanded Medicaid, which are largely GOP-led states, would be restricted from increasing the rate of their current provider taxes, which would not have as sizable an impact.\nThe issue of provider taxes has divided GOP lawmakers, with conservatives arguing that states use these taxes to get more federal Medicaid matching funds, while more moderate members worry that limiting such taxes could hurt hospitals, particularly those in rural areas.\nStates use the revenue they raise from taxing providers to boost provider rates and fund health-related initiatives, among other uses. Every state except one levies at least one type of provider tax.\nAlso, the Senate would require more parents to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month to maintain their Medicaid benefits. The committee would mandate that parents of children ages 15 and older would be subject to the work requirement, while the House version exempted parents of dependent children.\nThe Senate\u2019s changes would likely result in even more people losing their Medicaid coverage than the House provisions, which would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 7.8 million in 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nThe Senate Finance Committee text would kill a consumer tax credit for electric vehicles and quickly phase out tax credits helping homeowners defray the cost of energy efficient appliances and rooftop solar, ending those by next year.\nThe Senate text differs somewhat from the House bill on energy tax credits for businesses producing electricity. Like the House bill, it hits wind and solar producers particularly hard, phasing out clean energy tax credits for those projects starting next year, with the credit ending by 2028. However, companies generating electricity with zero-emission sources like nuclear, geothermal or hydropower can claim the credit for a longer period of time.\nThe Senate text is more generous than the House when it comes to a tax credit that businesses could claim for battery and clean energy manufacturing, although it eliminates that credit for wind turbine manufacturers by 2027. The text would also terminate a tax credit for companies that make clean hydrogen, something favored by the oil and gas industry.\nThe Senate committee would raise the debt limit by $5 trillion, compared to $4 trillion in the House version, providing more time for Trump to enact his policies without needing to negotiate a deal with Democrats to address the cap.\nThe US hit its roughly$36 trillion debt ceilingin January. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress toaddress the cap before its August recessto allow the agency to continue paying the nation\u2019s bills in full and on time, preventing a default that would likely have catastrophic global economic consequences.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/06\/16\/politics\/medicaid-cuts-senate-tax-bill","is_economy":true,"sentiment":0.0}
{"title":"From minimum wage increases to Medicare drug costs cap, these new laws are now in effect","date":"2025-01-01","body":"January 1 not only ushered in 2025 but a slew of new laws.\nIn 2024, states tackled issues ranging from abortion rights to gender-affirming care for minors, advancing legislation to take effect the following year. Starting Wednesday, Americans in nearly two dozen states will also see a hike in minimum wage while seniors covered by Medicare may have lower out-of-pocket prescription drug costs.\nHere are some of the new laws that are now in effect.\nThe minimum wage has increased in 21 states, according to the National Employment Law Project.\nThe hikes took effect in the following states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\nWith the increase, Washington continues to have the highest minimum wage of all states at $16.66, up 38 cents. Delaware will see the highest increase, from $13.25 to $15.\nMeanwhile,Minnesotahas moved to standardize its minimum wage. The state had set a minimum wage of $10.85 for larger employers and one of $8.85 for small employers, employees under the age of 18 and those in the US under a J-1 visa, which is for exchange visitors and can be used for foreign students to pursue academic training or research. This group will see the largest minimum-wage increase in the country \u2013 $2.28 \u2013 with the state\u2019s new minimum wage of $11.13 for all employers.\nWashington, DC, continues to have the highest minimum wage in the country at $17.05 after a 45-cent hike in July.\nA ban on gender-affirming surgeries for minors is now in effect in New Hampshire, though these surgical procedures are rarely performed on children.\nHB 619, which was signed by GOP Gov. Chris Sununu in July, also allows minors who went through such surgery and their parents to bring a lawsuit against the medical provider who performed the surgery within two years of the procedure, as well as against anyone who \u201caided or abetted\u201d the procedure.\nNew York\u2019sconstitution has been amendedto reflect abortionprotections approved by voterson Election Day.\nThe equal protection clause of the state\u2019s constitution now says that a person\u2019s rights cannot be denied due to \u201cpregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d\nThe constitutional amendment does not change the status of abortion in the state, where the procedure remains legal until viability, which is around 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy.\nA provision of theInflation Reduction Act\u2013 Biden\u2019s sweeping health care, tax and climate bill that passed in 2022 \u2013is broadening clean electricity tax creditsnow that it is in effect.\nTax credits to help businesses produce and invest in clean energy have expanded to all facilities and energy storage systems that can produce energy without any planet-warming pollution. The tax credits apply to any kind of energy that has no greenhouse gases, including wind, solar, hydropower, energy storage, geothermal and tidal power.\nMedicare enrollees will now pay amaximum of $2,000on out-of-pocket prescription drug costs annually as part of another provision of the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe limit applies to prescription drugs bought at pharmacies and through mail orders, which are covered through Medicare Part D.\nPrior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, there was no limit on out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare enrollees.\nCNN\u2019s Tami Luhby and Ella Nilsen contributed to this report.","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/01\/politics\/new-laws-2025","is_economy":true,"sentiment":1.0}
