That\u2019s according to the latest Fox News national survey released Wednesday.\nSeventy-two percent rate economic conditions negatively (only fair or poor). That\u2019s an improvement from 76% who said the same last month and the 77% who held that view a year ago, but it\u2019s worse than the 67% who rated it negatively this summer (July 2025).\nFOX NEWS POLL: HOW DO VOTERS FEEL ABOUT AI? IT\u2019S COMPLICATED\nMeanwhile, 44% say they are falling behind financially, up from 36% in June and about where things stood in October 2024. In polling going back to 2018, that number has only been worse twice: 45% said they were falling behind in June 2023 and 47% in June 2022.\nFOX NEWS POLL: HOLIDAY TOGETHERNESS TOPS POLITICAL DIFFERENCES\nA lot of the negative sentiment is driven by 9 in 10 Democrats and independents giving the economy bad marks and more than half of each saying they are falling behind. At the same time, nearly half of Republicans give the economy negative marks and about 3 in 10 say they\u2019re slipping financially. Those most likely to say they\u2019re losing ground include women under age 45 (57%), households with income below $50,000 (56%), independents (53%), urban voters (49%), and those without a college degree (49%). Women are 12 percentage points more likely than men to say they are falling behind (50% vs. 38%).\nAll this might shed light on why only 39% of voters approve of how President Donald Trump is handling the economy \u2014 one point above last month\u2019s low of 38% \u2014 and why 58% think he is focused on the wrong things.\u00a0That\u2019s about the same response voters gave former President Joe Biden four years ago, when 54% said he was prioritizing the wrong issues.\nApproval of Trump\u2019s performance is also below 40% on healthcare (37%), government spending (37%) and tariffs (36%). He received better marks on foreign policy (42%), immigration (45%) and crime (47%).\u00a0His best job numbers are on border security, where a slim 51% majority approves.\nTrump\u2019s overall job rating is upside-down by 12 points \u2014 44% approve and 56% disapprove. That\u2019s a bit of an improvement since a dip last month when it was 41\u201358% (his second-term low). His highest this term, 49\u201351%, came in March, while his best over both terms was 49-49% in April 2020.\nViews on the direction of the country are on a similar track, with 59% saying they are dissatisfied. That\u2019s a 9-point improvement from a year ago, when 68% were unhappy at the end of Biden\u2019s term. Meanwhile, 41% say they\u2019re satisfied, up from 31% in December 2024. The improvement is driven more by Republicans, whose satisfaction jumped 53 points, than by Democrats, whose satisfaction fell 32 points. Among independents, there is also an uptick (+8).\nDespite the current inflation rate being lower than the long-term average, fully 90% of voters are extremely or very concerned aboutinflation and high prices. That\u2019s the most in more than two years, and 61% are extremely concerned, up from 48% in June and the largest number in more than two years. About the same share is worried about healthcare prices (86% concerned, including 55% extremely concerned).\nThat explains why the top three issues voters say the president should be paying more attention to right now are high prices (42%), healthcare (19%) and jobs (12%).\nAnd they think he should be paying less attention to immigration (30%), tariffs (28%) and foreign policy (17%).\nNEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICAN VOTERS BACK SOCIAL MEDIA BAN FOR KIDS UNDER 16, FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS\nThe issue both Democrats and Republicans say should be Trump\u2019s priority is high prices, and they also agree the next two issues should be healthcare (to varying degrees) and jobs.\n\"Trump\u2019s position is better than Biden\u2019s a year ago, but worse than his own in late 2017,\" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"The problem is voters haven\u2019t gotten used to a six-dollar box of cereal, and they don\u2019t think the president\u2019s policy initiatives \u2014 the One Big Beautiful Bill, and on tariffs and immigration \u2014 are addressing prices.\"\nMajorities are concerned about the country\u2019s political divisions (82%), the decline of moral values (75%), crime (74%), the federal deficit (71%), AI technology (63%) and climate change (58%). Concern about illegal immigration decreased from 67% in June to 57% in the new survey, while 66% say they are worried about ICE detentions and deportations.\nDemocratsare nearly five times as likely as Republicans to say Trump should pay less attention to immigration, while three times as many Republicans as Democrats say foreign policy should be a lower priority. Roughly equal numbers in both parties think he should turn his attention away from tariffs. Tariffs are the issue on which Trump receives his lowest approval among all voters (36%) and among Republicans (72%).\n\u2013 In 2017, during Trump\u2019s first term, 62% of voters felt he was keeping his \"America First\" promise. Today, that\u2019s down to 49% who feel that way (51% say \"he abandoned that pledge\"). Most of the decline comes from a 20-point drop among Democrats and a 26-point drop among independents. Among Republicans, 91% said Trump was keeping his \"America First\" pledge in 2017 and 87% feel he is today.\n\u2013 While all administration members included in the survey have a net negative job rating, some fared better than others.\u00a0Secretary of StateMarco Rubioreceived the best marks, with a net negative score of -5 points. Next, it\u2019s Vice President JD Vance, at -8, Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at -12 each, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at -13, and Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethat -19. Among Republicans, approval hits 87% for Trump and 86% for Vance and Rubio, 80% for Noem, 78% for Hegseth and 77% for Kennedy. Approval among MAGA supporters is even higher: Trump 97%, Vance 94%, Rubio 92%, Noem 90%, Hegseth 88% and Kennedy 87%.\n\u2013 More than 6 in 10 voters disapprove of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Some 22% of Republicans disapprove of their party\u2019s lawmakers, while 34% of Democrats disapprove of theirs. Three quarters of independents disapprove of congressional Democrats and Republicans.\n\u2013 Around two-thirds of both parents and voters generally favor banning children under age 16 from using social media platforms as well as banning cellphones in K-12 classrooms. More Republicans favor the social media ban (73%) and cellphone ban (81%) than Democrats (56% and 59% respectively). Non-parents (71%) are more likely than parents (63%) to want cellphones out of school.\n\u2013 A 53% majority opposes theU.S. militaryusing deadly force against presumed Venezuelan drug-trafficking boats, up from 47% last month. That 6-point increase in opposition comes from Democrats (+8 points), Republicans (+6), and independents (+4).\n\u2013 Most Republicans (84%) favor using the National Guard and U.S. military to assist local law enforcement in fighting crime in big cities, while most Democrats (87%) and more than half of independents (57%) oppose doing so. Overall, 47% of voters favor the action and 53% oppose it.\nCLICK HERE FORCROSSTABSANDTOPLINE\nConducted December 12-15, 2025, under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,001 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file.

For America\u2019s sake, he should find his next one in my home state of Illinois.\nCook County \u2014 home of Chicago and most of the state\u2019s leftist lunacy \u2014 hastaken the nation\u2019s furthest steptoward a so-called universal basic income (UBI). Going forward, many low-income residents will permanently get monthly checks of $500. The goal is to help the poor stay on their feet, but in reality, the poor will stay poor and get more numerous. Not only should the president call out this injustice, but he should contrast it with his\u00a0recent call to eliminate income taxes altogether. This may be Trump\u2019s greatest opportunity for moral and economic leadership yet.\nMake no mistake: A\u00a0UBI is the left\u2019s next national priority. It\u2019s the epitome of their now-impenetrable belief that government alone should provide for people\u2019s needs. Democrats have laid the groundwork for UBI, as it\u2019s called, with refundable child tax credits during the pandemic andpilot programs across the country. The rise of artificial intelligence, with its threat of job losses, gives further momentum to leftists who say that government should give everyone enough money to get by. Even some on the right, like billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, have\u00a0jumped aboard\u00a0the UBI bandwagon.\nCOOK COUNTY IN ILLINOIS ESTABLISHES PERMANENT GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM\nBut UBI, like so much of thewelfare state, is a frontal assault on the human soul. It saps people\u2019s willingness to develop and apply their inherent talents, making poverty a permanent way of life. While activists and media outlets unfailingly call programs like Cook County\u2019s a \"success,\" real-world evidence shows their moral, economic and individual failure.\nA Boston suburb approved tripling the amount of money it's paying to residents in a guaranteed income program.(Getty Images)\nThe recent pilot programs in Democratic cities\u00a0caused fewer people to work. So\u00a0did the refundable child tax credit. When the federal government tested an early version of UBI in the 1970s, recipientslost$5 in lifetime earnings for every taxpayer dollar they received.\nOnly one word can sum up UBI: evil. It\u2019s morally wrong to steal people\u2019s drive to make the most of their life. It\u2019s inhumane to replace the ladder of opportunity with a cot. At its core, UBI encourages people to tolerate an unhappy existence instead of finding fulfillment through striving, succeeding and contributing to society.\nBut as Cook County shows, UBI has political momentum. The best way to beat such a bad idea is with a better idea. A transformative idea that not only highlights the injustice, but shows a real path forward. That\u2019s where Trump comes in, especially his idea to eliminate income taxes.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe president made this comment flippantly after a Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2, saying that income taxes won\u2019t be needed because of tariff revenue. But the real case for killing income taxes is that, like UBI, they also stifle work and limit its rewards. He could frame ending income taxes as giving every American the \"universal right to earn,\" while directly contrasting it with a universal basic income.\nPROGRESSIVE CITIES GAMBLE WITH UNIVERSAL INCOME WHILE INFLATION THREAT LOOMS\nWithout income taxes, every American would keep every penny of what they earn, full stop. There\u2019s no greater spur to work, to innovate, to start a small business \u2014 to do all the things that move individuals and the entire nation forward. The universal right to earn would unleash a new era of growth and wealth creation, benefiting the least fortunate the most. Why? Because it taps into every person\u2019s innate desire to strive and rise. Contrast that with a universal income, which traps people in poverty.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nAmericans aren\u2019t used to hearing such bold vision or languagefrom Republicans, but if any politician can make a strong case, it\u2019s Donald Trump. In fact, the president could go even further rhetorically, while still staying on firm moral grounds. At its core, taxing labor is a form of slavery, since it takes away the fruits of man\u2019s labor. The 13th\u00a0Amendment banned slavery, but the 16th\u00a0Amendment reinstated a sliver of it by allowing income taxes. Donald Trump could easily say: For America\u2019s 250th\u00a0birthday, we should end this injustice once and for all and finally realize our national promise.\nI freely acknowledge that eliminating income taxes is a gargantuan political lift. The chances of success are miniscule. But the same was once true of a universal basic income. Now it\u2019s a fact of life in Cook County, and it will surely be Democrats\u2019 top priority the next time they control the White House and Congress. Someone has to provide an alternative vision \u2014 one that actually uplifts the poorest Americans, instead of shackling them in poverty forever.

The Department of Energy oversees the reserve.\nBURGUM CALLS CALIFORNIA A \u2018NATIONAL SECURITY RISK\u2019 AS ENERGY CHIEF WARNS BLUE STATES ARE SKEWING COST AVERAGES\nThe Trump White House said that the administration is gradually refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after it was partially drained under the Biden administration.(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\nA Trump official explained that the administration is working to \"gradually\" refill the stash of oil, while citing significant \"damage\" left to the reserve following the Biden administration releasing millions of barrels of oil in 2021 and 2022.\n\"Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous green energy policies sent gas prices soaring across the country, making the past four years painfully unaffordable for Americans filling their gas tanks to commute to work, take their children to school, and travel during the summer and holiday seasons,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital.\n\"In a desperate attempt to provide an illusion of relief during his 2024 campaign, Joe Biden irresponsibly depleted our Strategic Petroleum Reserve \u2014 shamelessly jeopardizing our economic and national security. President Trump\u2019s energy dominance agenda has already brought gas prices down across the country, while gradually replenishing the SPR, and they will continue to drop as we unleash American energy.\"\nBiden released 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2021 to lower gas prices and address the nation's supply chain issues, citing the move was needed after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a \"near economic standstill.\"\nHe upped the ante on draining the SPR in March 2022, announcing that his administration would release one million barrels of oil per day from the SPR for six months to combat rising gas prices. The announcement followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with the U.S. and other allies imposing steep sanctions on oil-rich Russia in response. Biden released roughly 300 million barrels of oil across his four years.\nThe U.S. uses about 20.2 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to theEnergy Information Administration, so the roughly 400 million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve would cover only about 20 days of demand if it were the country\u2019s sole source of crude.\nTRUMP COMPARES REAL WAGES UNDER HIS ADMIN VERSUS BIDEN'S DURING SPEECH CALLING OUT DEM AFFORDABILITY 'HOAX'\nBiden holds the top spot among presidents for releasing the most oil from the SPR, with his administration acknowledging at the time that it was \"unprecedented\" but needed to lower energy prices. SPR levels dropped to a 40-year low of 347 million barrels in July 2023 after the drawdowns in 2021 and 2022, compared to its record high at 727 million barrels under the Obama administration in 2009.\n\"The scale of this release is unprecedented: the world has never had a release of oil reserves at this 1 million per day rate for this length of time,\" the Biden administration said in astatement at the time, pinning blame for the prices on Russia. \"This record release will provide a historic amount of supply to serve as bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up.\"\nOther presidents have released oil from the reserve, including the President George H.W. Bush administration releasing 17.3 million barrels in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm, and the President George W. Bush administration ordering an 11 million barrel drawdown in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina rocked the Gulf Coast.\nPresident Biden in 2021 announced the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve of the Department of Energy to combat high energy prices which are at a seven-year high across the nation prior to the holiday travel season.(Alex Wong/Getty Images)\nA Trump administration official told Fox Digital that the \"repercussions of this damaging decision\" to release roughly 300 million barrels of oil \"persist.\"\nThe official said that releasing the oil under the Biden administration sparked $280 million incosts, delayed critical infrastructure maintenance, and put \"unprecedented\" wear and tear on storage and injection facilities.\nThe SPR currently holds just more than 400 million barrels, with a capacity of roughly 700 million barrels, Fox Digital learned. Refiling the reserve could cost up to $20 billion, according to the administration official, who underscored that the \"damage the Biden administration did to America\u2019s SPR and national security cannot be overstated.\"\nThe SPR notched its lowest levels in modern history under the Biden administration, though the reserve only held just a few million barrels of oil in the late 1970s and early 1980s as officials worked tofill the reserve.\nFox News Digital reached out to Biden's office for comment on the SPR and Trump administration's comments but did not immediately receive a reply.\nAfter Biden\u2019s record 2022 emergency drawdown, the Biden\u2013Harris administration directed the Energy Department to start repurchasing crude for the SPR at prices well below the roughly $95 per barrel it sold forin 2022.\nCongress needs to appropriate funds in order to refill the reserves. Currently, the Department of Energy has refill authority and funds granted under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" which appropriated $218 million for maintenance and repairs to the storage facilities and $171 million to refill the SPR.\nAppetite amongRepublicansto refill the SPR was apparent earlier in 2025, when House GOP lawmakers unveiled a budget proposal in May that included more than $1.5 billion to replenish and maintain the SPR. The funding was whittled down amid negotiations on the funding bill.\nArmed security stands near an oil pipe at the Bryan Mound facility of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.(Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images)\nThe Trump administration told Fox Digital that the Energy Department and Trump are working to gradually refill the reserve and remain committed to their previous pledges to do so, while awaiting additional funding from Congress.\nThe Department of Energy began refilling the SPR in October, Fox Digital learned, in October with a notice of intent to purchase a million barrels of oil, which was followed by the department awarding contracts to begin refilling the reserve. The Department of Energy expects that oil to be delivered to the reserves by the end of 2025.\n'PRICES ARE COMING DOWN': TRUMP HAILS HIS ECONOMY, BLAMES BIDEN AS VOTERS SAY COSTS STILL STING\nThe administration said it is examining other avenues to refill the reserves as it awaits further funding action from Congress, including exchanging 1 million barrels to ExxonMobil in July to address a temporary supply disruption at its Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery. Exxon will return the oil, plus an additional amount\u00a0that will be returned under a negotiated schedule by the third quarter of fiscal year 2026.\nTrump railed against Biden's plan and subsequent release of the oil in his interim between his first and second administration, including in 2021 when he told the New York Post that the reserve should only be tapped during \"serious emergencies, like war, and nothing else.\"\n\"Now I understand that Joe Biden will be announcing an \u2018attack\u2019 on the newly brimming Strategic Oil Reserves so that he could get the close to record-setting high oil prices artificially lowered,\"\u00a0Trump told the outlet at the time.\u00a0\"We were energy independent one year ago, now we are at the mercy of OPEC, gasoline is selling for $7 in parts of California, going up all over the Country, and they are taking oil from our Strategic Reserves.

The president and his administration have hit back against the Democrats' new winning campaign strategy, pinning blame for high costs on Biden administration policies that have had a lasting effect on the economy.\n\"American families faced constant pain at the pump, and those costs caused the price of everything else to go up as well,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"In fact, the average cost for a gallon of regular gas in the country was the most expensive price during a presidential term in U.S. history under Biden's disastrous leadership, even with them recklessly draining our strategic reserves to try and artificially decrease prices. But thanks to President Trump, those days are long behind us.

The report serves as a nationwide barometer of housing stress and shows whether the availability of affordable housing is improving or worsening, and who may be being hurt by the current conditions, which Congress can then use to craft policy.\nPolicymakers use it to gauge gaps in the supply of low-cost rentals, target federal housing programs, and understand trends in who is being left behind.

After the Great Recession, construction basically stalled, and it took years to recover. By some estimates, the U.S. is short four to seven million homes, and that long-term shortage is the core issue behind today\u2019s affordability challenges.\"\nHUD's 2025 report found that increased immigration has driven up housing prices, and that the \"unrestricted\" nature of the influx has both strained the housing market and priced-out many American families. The report found that an estimated 15 millionillegal immigrantsconstitute 30% of all foreign-born residents.\nTurner added in separate comments to Fox Business that HUD took away Federal Housing Authority-backed mortgages from illegal immigrants offered during the Biden administration, saying the former president \"turned a blind eye\" to the issue.\nIn California and New York, immigrants have accounted for 100% of all rental growth and over one-half of all growth in owner-occupied housing in recent years, the report found \u2013 while nationally, theforeign-born populationaccounted for more than 60% of the growth in rental demand.\nKRISTI NOEM SAYS BIDEN USED DHS 'TO INVADE THE COUNTRY WITH TERRORISTS'\nNationwide, the foreign-born population accounted for two-thirds of rental demand growth.\nHUD\u2019s report contrasted that figure with the 13% growth attributed to noncitizens in 2019 and 2023\u2019s lookbacks.\n\"This further demonstrates that non-citizen households are playing an increasing role in the household growth that is straining the affordable housing supply,\" the 109-page report said.\nNEW GOP BILL WOULD CUT OFF HOUSING FUNDS TO SANCTUARY CITIES DEFYING TRUMP DHS\nThe agency found that without the migrant surge, housing inventory pressures would have been far lower and prices would not have climbed as sharply, noting roughly 784,000 fewer households would have formed over that period.\nNet additions to the housing market from 2015 onward have not kept up with \"household formation among citizens\" and non-citizen population growth has also inordinately affectedrental markets.\nWorst-case housing reports have been released regularly since 1991, but the 2025 findings mark a sharper warning about the illegal immigration crisis\u2019 impact on the numbers.\nBIPARTISAN PLAN AIMS TO MAKE THE AMERICAN DREAM AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR MILLIONS OF FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS\nIn August, Turnerordered an audit of everypublic housing authority, seeking data on verifiable citizenship of those living in subsidized housing.\n\"No longer will illegal aliens be able to leave citizenship boxes blank or take advantage of HUD-funded housing, riding the coattails of hardworking American citizens,\" Turner said.\n\"Currently, HUD only serves one out of four eligible families due, in part, to the lack of enforcement of prohibition against federally funded assistance to illegal aliens,\" he continued.\nTRUMP'S BORDER MIRACLE: FROM BIDEN'S CHAOTIC IMMIGRATION CRISIS TO 'ALL QUIET' IN RECORD TIME\nVice PresidentJD Vancehighlighted a recent comment from Turner \u2013 who had been responding to a CNBC report that rents have dropped for four straight months.\n\"Six months of zero illegals released into our country.

McDaniel called on the mayor-elect to fire Khan, President Joe Biden's former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair, who Mamdani appointed as co-chair of his transition team.\nMcDaniel said that if the NYC mayor-elect is really going to be true to his word about lowering costs for New Yorkers, he cannot have someone like Khan in his administration who \"is not only a flashback to the dreaded Biden days that 77 million Americans rejected by re-electing President Trump,\" but also holds a history of \"policy prescriptions [that] have failed before and will again.\"\nMAMDANI ECONOMIC ADVISOR IS REPARATIONS ACTIVIST WHO SAYS 'DEVALUATION OF BLACK LIVES' INGRAINED IN US SYSTEM\nZohran Mamdani's transition co-chair Lina Khan speaks at a press conference Wednesday afternoon in Queens.(Alexi J.

McDaniel's letter said that \"early reports\" from the business community in New York have indicated they are prepared for a \"rehash\" of the playbook Khan ran at the FTC under Biden.\nOne example cited in the letter was Khan's alleged opposition to a proposed merger between Amazon and the Massachusetts-based company iRobot, designer of the popular self-cleaning vacuum called Roomba. According to McDaniel's letter, Khan's opposition contributed to the company's subsequent bankruptcy, and resulted in 350 iRobot employees losing their jobs amid a 31% cut to the company's workforce.

That's why you see the government grows every single year. That's why you see taxes go up most every year as well.\"\nWithe, a critic of both public- and private-sector unions, said private-sector unions at least have an incentive structure based on a company's or industry's bottom line, but public-sector unions, Withe argued, are incentivized by raising taxes and growing government.\n\"When you look at union spending in politics, you have to remember that their goal \u2014 their primary purpose is a business \u2014 so they're there to grow revenue. They're there to gain more revenue than the year previously,\" Withe pointed out. \"The difference with the government union is that that revenue comes from public employees. And the way that you hire more public employees is by raising taxes on the private sector so that you can hire more bureaucrats.\"\nDavid Osborne, senior director of labor policy for the Commonwealth Foundation and co-author of the report, said \"the big question\" from his report is whether rank-and-file union members are aware of how their money is actually being spent.\n\"Years ago, [union members] could expect union executives to use dues to drive member services, including contract negotiations and grievance processing,\" Osborne said. \"Now, union members are unwittingly propping up left-leaning candidates and progressive causes like abortion, critical race theory and defunding the police.\"\nMY TEACHERS UNION CALLS IT REPRESENTATION.

Collectively, the unions spent around $755 million on federal elections and national progressive politics, while their state-level affiliates combined to spend another $160 million on state races and ideological causes. Of that spending, $650 million, or 86%, originated from union membership dues, according to the Commonwealth Foundation.\nThe report notes the unions also collect voluntary political action committee (PAC) deductions from members and their families, which allows the unions to collect money that can then godirectly to candidates,something that is not supposed to be done with members' dues money.

They noted that the viewpoint that PresidentDonald Trump'senvironmental agenda is making the country stronger is also a facade.\n\"These policies might be good for Trump and Wright's rich corporate buddies, but they are downright evil for working people,\" Tim Donaghy, Greenpeace USA's research director, told Fox News Digital. \"The decisions made\u00a0in the last nine months are literally sucking money out of Americans' wallets and putting it into oil industry bank accounts, while pretending they're making the country stronger.\"\nDonaghy said that President Trump's plan to increase energy exports, for example, \"will increase\" costs for American families and exacerbate climate change, which he argued was another driver of increased housing insurance costs for families.\nCCP-LINKED FIRMS QUIETLY HOLD STAKES IN US SOLAR COMPANIES FUELING DEM'S GREEN PUSH\n\"The sad thing is that the Trump\u00a0administration's policies are creating more pollution that will make Americans sick. Every year, 350,000 Americans die younger from being exposed to toxic air pollution from burning fossil fuels. We need that number to go down. These \u2018wins\u2019 all but guarantee it will go up,\" Donaghy concluded.\nThe \"wins\" touted by the \"American Energy Dominance Coalition\" did not exclusively include deregulation efforts in theenergy sector,but also featured increased investments in nuclear energy production. The list also praised Secretary Wright for launching a critical review earlier this summer looking into the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the U.S. climate, as well as a study focused on identifying pipeline needs and potential permitting reforms that could be used to help speed up oil and gas production.\nSome of the additional deregulation \"wins\" listed by the coalition include the termination of $3.7 billion in carbon-capture and decarbonization grants, the cancellation of \"hundreds-of-millions\" in electric-vehicle and battery manufacturing grants and a push towards rescinding energy-efficiency standards for federal billions, which the conservative coalition argued could lead to saving millions of dollars in \"unnecessary upgrades.\"\n\"Chris Wright has done an amazing job of actually prioritizing American energy development and affordability rather than globalist misguided climate agendas,\" Heartland Institute President James Taylor said. \"American energy policy must continue to bolster affordable and reliable domestic energy sources rather than the agendas of foreign nations that are often hostile to American interests.\"\nMeanwhile, Sal Nuzzo, executive director of Consumers Defense, also praised Secretary Wright and his administration's \"most sweeping de-regulatory initiative in U.S. history,\" for overturning \"burdensome regulations\" that Nuzzo says hurt both consumers and businesses.\nNuzzo also pointed out that the Trump administration has taken a stand against \"politically motivated\" environmental, social, governance (ESG) \"schemes,\" which he said have been inflating energy costs and weakening U.S. independence while also undermining the free market system.\nBut the Environmental Working Group's (EWG) Bernadette Del Chiaro, who is EWG's senior vice president for its California-based operations, dismissed that the policy \"wins\" touted by these conservative groups were actually \"wins\" for the American people. Instead, Del Chiaro described them as \"giveaways\" to the fossil fuel industry that will result in greater pollution, higher energy costs, and fewer choices for consumers.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nEnergy Department Secretary Chris Wright (right) is juxtaposed in this split-image next to a photo of an environmentalist protester holding up a sign reading \"BIG OIL PROFITS.

These rollbacks kill jobs, strand private investment, and hand global economic advantage to China just as the rest of the world races toward cheaper, cleaner and more competitive energy sources,\" Del Chiaro told Fox News Digital.\n\"If the priority is affordability, the Administration is on the wrong track as there\u2019s no cheaper energy resource than solar,\" she added. \"And if beefing upAmerican energyindependence is the goal, once again, we are veering off course because there is nothing more abundant than the sunshine that falls on our country \u2018from sea to shining sea,\u2019 or more homegrown than the wind that whips across our Great Plains.\"", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admins-energy-agenda-hailed-for-crucial-wins-green-activists-lash-out"}

For housing, buildings, and other infrastructure systems (e.g. roads, water systems, etc.), it is crucial and mission-critical for employers to have a durable and dependable pipeline of talent,\" Kane said.\n\"Without this pipeline, employers are competing against each other for scarce talent, projects can run into delays, and additional uncertainties and costs may mount over time,\" added Kane, who studies the intersection between infrastructure and economic development.\nThe revelation comes as the U.S. grapples with a slew ofhousing challengesthat, brick by brick and regulation by regulation, have helped contribute to today\u2019s crisis.\nTRUMP'S 50-YEAR MORTGAGE MAY BURDEN AMERICANS WITH MORE DEBT, EXPERTS SAY\nExperts point to three major forces doing the most damage: restrictive zoning, land-use barriers and financial policies that have choked supply and pushed prices out of reach.\nThe labor squeeze is growing more severe as building materials get pricier and the broader economy faces new pressures.(Mario Tama/Getty Images)\nJim Tobin, president and CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, said the cost ofregulationsalone plays a massive role in housing affordability.\n\"Regulatory burdens really do add up on the unaffordability index,\" Tobin told Fox News Digital.\n\"We estimate that 24% of the cost of a single-family home is embedded in regulations at all three levels of local, state and federal government. That comes out to roughly $94,000 in regulatory costs.\"\nExperts say rules and red tape are choking supply and driving up home prices across America.(Matthew Busch/Bloomberg/Getty Images)\nExperts say the quickest path to easing the housing crunch is lowering interest rates and peeling back regulations that have stifled new construction. But without enough workers, they warn, even a more favorable policy environment won\u2019t translate into the surge of new supply the market needs.\n\"Looking ahead, even as interest rates ease, labor constraints will remain a key bottleneck, meaning slower housing starts, elevated prices and continued affordability challenges in 2026 unless workforce development and skilled trades training accelerates,\" Brady added.\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\nKane said the labor crunch is intensifying alongside rising material costs and broader economic headwinds.\n\"Having enough skilled workers is one of many considerations facing home builders and other developers in the coming year. The lack of certainty on this front is only adding to the uncertainties in the country's built environment, which can result in project delays, slower growth in new housing stock and downstream impacts on household affordability,\" Kane said.\nAmanda covers the intersection of business and geopolitics for Fox News Digital.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/construction-labor-crunch-drives-up-costs-deepens-americas-housing-affordability-crisis"}

But it is also a strange time to be alive, particularly when it comes to wealth.\nWhen you think about wealth and what it does for someone and their quality of life, there are a few ways to view it. Certainly wealth \"buys\" freedom and flexibility, which is arguably the most important role of wealth.\nBut, at a micro level, measuring wealth for many Americans is about day-to-dayquality of life. On one hand, wealth should grant access to wants \u2014 goods and services above and beyond your day-to-day needs.\nWHY GEN Z DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS\nWealth is also supposed to be a shield against the stresses tied up with money, reducing worry over covering basic needs and feeling like you have financial breathing room from day to day and month to month.\nToday in America, at a practical level, we live with awealth paradox.\nWe have access to luxuries that people of hundreds of years ago couldn\u2019t have dreamed.\nWe have access to ground-breaking medicines and lifesaving procedures. We have technology, including portable tech that we can carry in our pockets, with access to just about all the information ever created. We have creation tools as well.\nWe have cars with incredible functionality (probably too much, in my opinion). We are able to jet across the country or even around the world. Many of us have closets full of clothing, shoes and accessories. Our grocery stores are filled with food, aisles lined with overwhelming choices.\nWe are living witheveryday luxuriesthat, if you step back, are in many ways hard to believe.\nSo, while we can access wants, much of the working and middle class still live with the stress of affording basic costs of living.\nHousing is difficult and expensive to come by. Even if one can afford a house and interest payments, the carrying costs, including property taxes and insurance, as well as maintenance, eat up a larger percentage of wages.\nHealthcare costs, particularly for those who don\u2019t have corporate employer-sponsored health benefits, are skyrocketing. Just the insurance portion alone, separate from any care costs paid out of pocket, is a heavy burden on families.\nEducation, particularly higher education, is also a stressor, saddling young people with five or even six figures\u2019 worth of debt, while in many cases not providing an appropriate return on investment.\nAnd while we have an abundance of food, Americans\u2019 dollars buy less. Even eating in restaurants at every level, from fast food to sit-down dining, has exploded in cost.\nYes, in 2025, the working and middle class may haveaccess to more, but the stress of basic living has increased exponentially. And that makes it harder to feel \"wealthy.\"\nAre we truly wealthy, as individuals and as a nation, if a key tenet of wealth, that shield from financial stress, has been pierced?\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIf we look at the culprits, from housing to healthcare to education, all are areas where the government (and government-adjacent policy) has increased costs. It is up to them to start removing barriers and making Americans truly wealthy again.\nMoreover, the Fed\u2019s policies, including around 15 years of zero and near-zero interest rate policy, quantitative easing, suppressed real rates, and then whipsaw tightening, structurally created a world where asset owners have seen their wealth increase and those without assets fell behind. This has underscored today\u2019s wealth paradox: Americans enjoy luxury consumption but can\u2019t afford the \"entry ticket\" to wealth because the cost of the foundational asset \u2014 that is, a home \u2014 has been financialized far beyond incomes.\nA healthy economy needs to be balanced with a healthy society, and you can\u2019t have that if individuals don\u2019t have peace of mind. Financial stress is cited as a reason in almost one out of every four divorces. It correlates with anxiety, depression and physical health issues.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nOf course, some of that is self-inflicted, but looking at thepercentage of incomethat basic needs are accounting for today, something is wrong.\nOur wealth paradox is one that can be solved with action. We need real reform on getting the government to stop sucking up the wealth of hardworking Americans. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness hangs in the balance.\nCarol Roth is a former investment banker, entrepreneur and author of the new book\"You Will Own Nothing\"Broadside Books.

Obamacare didn\u2019t let people keep their insurance plans or their doctors, and families didn\u2019t save money \u2014\u00a0and neither did the federal government. Families have been left with higher costs and healthcare that doesn\u2019t meet their needs.\nI want to tell you about a family with a preexisting health condition that I think about whenever I talk about healthcare in our country.\u00a0They grew up in public housing, rarely saw a doctor. One of the kids had a hip disease.\u00a0Their mom would drive 200 miles to a charity hospital to get him treatment.\u00a0That was my family growing up.\nWhen I hear stories offamilies struggling to afford their premiums, putting off treatment because it\u2019s too expensive, or splitting their pills in half to make them last longer, I see my mother and my brother and the struggle my family went through. And I see a system that has continued to fail families like mine while ruining the market for everyone else.\nLONGTIME OBAMACARE CRITIC SAYS TRUMP PLAN WON'T SOLVE PROGRAM'S FATAL FLAWS\nObamacare isn't affordable for many Americans, so it needs to be fixed in Congress.(Cyberguy.com)\nRepublicans, and even Democrats, agree:Obamacare hasn\u2019t made healthcare any more affordable. I want people to be able to get affordable, accessible healthcare and keep the safety net for families that Obamacare is intended to be, which means we have to take action.\nI know we can fix Obamacare. I have been working with PresidentDonald Trumpand my colleagues on a\u00a0bill\u00a0that makes simple fixes to Obamacare that will help families get healthcare that fits their needs, all while driving down costs. Under my\u00a0plan, we don\u2019t replace Obamacare\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. We keep\u00a0healthcare.gov\u00a0and state exchanges, we maintain protections for individuals with preexisting conditions, and nobody will lose healthcare.\nWe simply add options and let Americans be consumers, making the choice that works best for them and their families.

That doesn\u2019t make any sense. If an insurance provider in Kansas offers a great plan, a family in Georgia should be able to buy it. By letting the states opt in to a system that allows sales across state lines, we are opening up thehealth insurance marketacross the country, which encourages innovation and competition to drive down prices and create better choices for families.\nJust like shopping for clothes or groceries, you\u2019re no longer limited to the stores in your town; you have access to stores states away to find what you want instead of settling for what\u2019s right in front of you.

{"title": "A solution to the housing affordability problem: Marriage", "date": "2025-12-01", "body": "Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway and former Democratic Pennsylvania congressman Patrick Murphy discuss the White House\u2019s focus on affordability ahead of Thanksgiving on \u2018The Story with Martha MacCallum.\u2019\nA key aspect of the suddenly trendy \"affordability\" problem is that young adults are said to be priced out of thehousing market. The statistics appear to be compelling. Per the National Association of Realtors, \"Today's young adults continue to face delays in homeownership compared to past generations at the same age. Not only is the homeownership rate lower for those under 35 today compared to past generations, but the first-time buyer share is lower, and the age of first-time buyers is older than seen historically.\"\nThe most obvious approach to helping Gen Zers buy homes is to lower costs by increasing available supply. To be sure, this supply-side solution has its place. But here\u2019s something else to consider: marriage.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that high housing costs coincide with another socioeconomic trend:low marriage rates. Per the Institute of Family Studies, \"only about 60% of 35-year-old men are ever married today, down from 90% in 1980.\" And, \"just 20% of 25-year-old women and 23% of 25-year-old men have ever married today. These are close to the lowest levels ever observed for marriage rates.\"\nThe decline in marriage has several important implications for housing costs.\nTRUMP\u2019S\u00a050-YEAR\u00a0MORTGAGE JUST INTRODUCES A NEW KIND OF DEBT\nOne way to defeat the affordability crunch is the most traditional way \u2014 marriage.(iStock)\nThe most obvious, of course, is the fact that two incomes are better than one when it comes to saving for a down payment andpaying monthly mortgage costs. Affordability that arises from pooling income \u2014 and aspirations \u2014 reflects an assumption about marriage that has faded.\nBrad Wilcox of the Institute of Family Studies calls it \"cornerstone marriage\" \u2014 the idea of starting out poor and working together to improve a shared lot. He distinguishes between that and \"capstone marriage\" \u2014 wedding once one (or two) have become affluent enough to afford a destination wedding and a house. In other words, it\u2019s not just the marriage rate that has declined, it\u2019s the idea of the role of marriage, that has.\nThen there\u2019s the less obvious but crucial side effect of a low marriage rate: the establishment of more small, often single-person households creates a need for more housing for which young adults must compete when supply lags. This is not a marginal demographic change. Marriage rates among young adults have fallen sharply over time, meaning fewer couples, more single adults, and therefore more households competing for limited units.\nOn this point, census data is clear. The average household size has steadily decreased, from 3.3 persons per household in 1960 to just 2.4 in 2024. At the same time, the number of overall households has steadily climbed, from 117 million in 2010 to 132 million in 2024. It\u2019s an increase disproportionate to the increase in population, as measured by the number of households per million Americans, which increased during the same period from 380,744 to 390,171. That same figure increased from 295,090 in 1960.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThat increase, moreover, is driven by the fact that more of us live alone. Between 2010 and 2024, the number of single-person households increased from 31 million to 38 million, while the number of three-person households barely increased, from 18 million to 19 million. Even that figure may not reflect an increase of married couples with a child; many Gen Z members live with their parents into their 30s. In 1960, just 11% of men and 7% of women ages 25 to 34 lived with their parents, whereas in 2022, 19% of men and 12% of women were living in their parents\u2019 homes.\nIt should be no surprise that Americans are said to be enduring anepidemic of loneliness: many of us are literally alone at home.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe increase in single-person households reflects more than thedeclining marriage rate, of course. Women live longer than men and thus elderly women tend to live alone. Men age 75 and older are nearly twice as likely (67%) as women (35%) to live with a spouse. Government housing policy adds to the problem.\u00a0Public housing authorities give priority to those of lowest incomes for public housing or housing vouchers. Those inevitably turn out to be single mothers with children or older women without spouses. Only 3% of public or subsidized housing households are two adults with children.\nIt\u2019s self-evident, though, that marriage can serve to ameliorate the housing affordability challenge in two ways: by serving to pool incomes and by reducing the demand for standalone households. Two heads are better than one, and in other words, one bed is better than two.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM HOWARD HUSOCK\nHoward Husock is the author of \"The Projects:\u00a0A New History of Public Housing\" (NYU Press, 2025) and of \"The Poor Side of Town: And Why We Need It\" (Encounter Books).\u00a0He is a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

Democrats have overperformed in all of them to the tune of about 16 percentage points on average,\" Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin touted in a Fox News Digital interview days ahead of the2025 elections.\nIt was the issue that boosted Trump and Republicans in the 2024 elections, as they won back the White House and Senate majority and kept control of the House.\nBut a year later, the economy, and everyday expenses in particular, are working against the president and his party in the 2025 elections.\nFOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SAY WHITE HOUSE IS DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD ON ECONOMY\nDemocrats, with an across-the-board focus on affordability, enjoyed sweeping success at the ballot box earlier this month, with double-digit victories in the gubernatorial showdowns in blue-leaning but competitive New Jersey and Virginia, as well as major victories in high-profile contests in battlegrounds Georgia and Pennsylvania and solidly blue New York City and California.\nDemocratic Rep.

But she neither affirmed nor pulled back her support of Jones.\nWhile the scandal grabbed national headlines, in the end it didn't slow down the Democrats, as Spanberger crushed Earle-Sears by 15 points. Democrats won the separate election for lieutenant governor by 11 points and Jones even pulled off a 6-point victory over Republican incumbent Jason Miyares.\nAiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections, Trump in June first floated the idea of rare but not unheard of mid-decade congressional redistricting.\nThe mission was simple: redraw congressional district maps in red states to pad the GOP's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.\nTrump's first target: Texas.\nA month later, when asked by reporters about his plan to add Republican-leaning House seats across the country, the president said, \"Texas will be the biggest one.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nFormer House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, D-Calif., finally announced what everyone expected, that she would not run for office again now that she\u2019s 85. It\u2019s the end of an era, an era of broadcast TV flattery and shamelessness. Pelosi has wielded great power over her members, and also great power over the national media. She viciously attacks any reporter that asks her a question she doesn\u2019t want to answer. In recent years, the big networks have been putty in her hands.\nThis starts with the issue of her husband Paul\u2019s aggressive financial trading, and her quiet opposition to any attempt to restrict members of Congress from trading stocks, which is on the agenda again. Back in 2011, CBS\u2019s \"60 Minutes\" cooperated with conservative author Peter Schweizer when his book \"Throw Them All Out\" was published. Since then, the issue has largely vanished.\nA New York Post analysisrevealed that before first taking office in 1987, Pelosi and her husband reported between $610,000 and $785,000 in stocks in their portfolio \u2014 worth $133.7 million today, according to the latest estimates from Quiver Quantitative. That means that Nancy Pelosi grew her little nest egg by 16,930%.\nIn the last four years, the gush from the press has been remarkably excessive. Stock trading didn\u2019t come up in 2022 in a George Stephanopoulos interview on ABC\u2019s \"This Week.\" Stephanopoulos asked then-Speaker Pelosi: \"the [Biden] White House is warning of an imminent invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainians seem to think that\u2019s all hype. Do you believe that Putin is poised to invade?\" Stephanopoulos even asked Pelosi if \"Congress [is] doing everything you can to prevent an invasion?\" Most laughably, he asked her what \"should President Putin know from you, the speaker of the House, about the consequences of invasion?\"\nFIVE TIMES NANCY PELOSI LOST HER COOL WITH THE MEDIA\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi being interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025.(Screenshot/CNN)\nWhen Democrats lost the House in the midterms, Pelosi relinquished her post as Democrat leader, but the encomiums never stopped. On CBS\u2019s \"Sunday Morning\" in early 2024, substitute host Tracy Smith announced, \"House Speaker Emerita that has a new book out, \u2018The Art of Power\u2019 \u2014 an art which Nancy Pelosi is something of a master.\"\nPelosi also gushed, proclaiming PresidentJoe Bidenwas at the \"top of his game. Such a consequential president of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of president of the United States.\" Lesley Stahl asked if she was serious: \"Lincoln and Joe Biden?\" Pelosi underlined it: \"You got Teddy Roosevelt up there, and he\u2019s wonderful. I don\u2019t say take him down, but you can add Biden.\"\nStahl just had to follow up that comedy with flattery: \"If there were a Mount Rushmore for speakers of the House, Nancy Pelosi would certainly be up there, commemorating her 20 years as acommanding leader in Congress.\" If there's a stellar achievement on Pelosi's r\u00e9sum\u00e9, it has to be how impressively she and her husband have enriched themselves while she was in \"public service.\"\nNANCY PELOSI'S CRITICS CELEBRATE RETIREMENT ANNOUNCEMENT\nTwo weeks before the 2024 election, CNN and PBS host Christiane Amanpour read a virulently anti-Trump passage from Pelosi\u2019s book. It was about his \"repeatedly stomping out of meetings, his foul mouth, his pounding on tables, his temper tantrums, his disrespect for our nation\u2019s patriots, and his total separation from reality and actual events.\" Then Amanpour asked: \"How did you deal with that? And do you think this country, your country, can survive another term?\" What would America do without Pelosi?\nOn the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 riot, \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Lester Holt was a soft touch. He walked through the hallways of the Capitol with her and noted they \"desecrated your office\" and one rioter wrote he wanted to \"shoot her in her freaking brain.\" Pelosi said the memory \"breaks your heart. It\u2019s like somebody in the White House dropped a bomb on the Congress.\"\nHolt concluded with the devout Catholic angle: \"You\u2019ve been very vocal in the past about praying for your adversaries.\" She said, \"I always do,\" but the current Republican Party \"melted down into a cult.\"\nPerhaps the most servile interviewer was \"PBS NewsHour\" co-anchor Geoff Bennett, who interviewed Pelosi in front of a PBS crowd in California in May. He began by gushing to the crowd that Pelosi, who did the interview remotely from Boston, is \"known for herpolitical leadership, her sharp insights and her real singular ability to keep Democrats united.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nBizarrely, Bennett expressed shock that the Democrats weren\u2019t getting credit for the economy: \"Having coveredDemocratic policies, you can say objectively that Democrats did have policies that benefited the middle class! And Joe Biden spent a lot of political capital passing them into law and yet it didn\u2019t seem to resonate, didn\u2019t connect with the American people in this last election.\"\nStahl just had to follow up that comedy with flattery: \"If there were a Mount Rushmore for speakers of the House, Nancy Pelosi would certainly be up there, commemorating her 20 years as a commanding leader in Congress.\"\nPelosi generously said the stupid voters shouldn\u2019t be blamed: \"When somebody doesn't get a message, it's not because of them.

Abigail Spanberger in solidly blue Virginia were somehow referenda on President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. This fallacy not only ignores the recent past but also misses the facts immediately in front of us that Trump\u2019s policies are making America affordable again.\nPrices soared during the Biden administration. Inflation rose at a near 5% annualized rate during his term. Such a disaster is second only to the severe Carter-led inflation of the 1970s, which collapsed U.S. living standards. Contrast this with Trump\u2019s first term, when inflation rose at less than a 2% annualized rate.\nThe memory of low inflation and strongeconomic growthduring Trump\u2019s first term inspired Americans to re-elect him for a second term. Voters put their trust in Trump\u2019s stewardship after a disastrous four years of economic hardship under Biden.\u00a0Immediately after taking office, Trump began laying the groundwork for a Golden Age economy. While there is still much work ahead to help Americans out of the hole created by the Biden administration, we are making progress.\nThe first step was passing theOne Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), which will help Make America Affordable Again. There are three key provisions in the OBBB that will boost take-home worker pay.\nTRUMP FLIPS DEMS' 'AFFORDABILITY' SCRIPT, TURNING BUZZWORD INTO MAGA MATERIAL AS MAMDANI VISIT LOOMS\nPresident Donald Trump meets with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani (L) in the Oval Office of the White House on Nov. 21, 2025, in Washington, DC.(Andrew Harnick/Getty Images)\nFirst is permanent full expensing ofbusiness investment, or what is commonly referred to as capital expenditures (or \"capex\"). Thanks to this bold tax incentive, companies can now write off the full cost of purchasing computers, industrial machinery, software and any other equipment. When firms raise their capex, productivity increases, since workers have additional capital to produce the goods and services businesses and consumers want. Greater productivity, in turn, raises household living standards by providing companies the ability to pay their workers more. Economic history is replete with examples when surging productivity produced large increases in worker wages.\nThe second provision in the OBBB dovetails with the capex incentive but may be even more powerful. Companies can now deduct the entire cost ofbuilding a manufacturing plantor agricultural structure in the first year of construction.\nIn the past, companies had to wait nearly 40 years to depreciate the full cost of factories and farm structure. But not anymore. This novel tax incentive will lead to a massive increase in industrial building and support reshoring of our supply chains. With that will comehigh-paying construction jobs. And when the project is done, there will be high-paying jobs inside those structures, where workers will be using the newest technologies thanks to the capex incentives. The effect will be an industrial boom.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIn tandem, a capex and industrial construction boom will increase the economy\u2019s underlying productive capacity, which in the past has always been disinflationary. This means that inflation is poised to fall much further, thereby giving workers an added lift. This is a one-two punch in restoring worker purchasing power because nominal wages will be rising at the same time inflation will be falling. The upshot is a powerful historical gain in real wages, similar but even bigger than Trump\u2019s first term.\nThe third provision that will improve affordability is notax on tips or overtime pay. By eliminating these taxes, working Americans will get to keep more of their hard-earned income. This is critical to restoring household finances to lower- and middle-class families, who suffered disproportionately under the prior administration. Real after-tax wages for blue collar workers are poised to soar thanks to Trump\u2019s policies and economic vision.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nFrom higher take-home pay for hardworking families totax incentivesthat will drive a disinflationary boom, the One Big Beautiful Bill was engineered to Make America Affordable Again.

The study, conducted in 2018, showed the average dinner was 30 minutes to 50 minutes shorter at tables full of politically diverse folks, while a study measuring the same thing in 2020 found politically diverse dinners to be about 24 minutes shorter on average.\nMeanwhile, other Thanksgiving survey data from 2025, published by YouGov, found that 19% of Democrats expect to have political arguments at the dinner table, compared to 9% of Republicans.\nGUY FIERI INSISTS THANKSGIVING IS 'ONE OF THE MORE AFFORDABLE HOLIDAYS' FOR FAMILIES TO COOK ON A BUDGET\nPresident George W. Bush traveled to Iraq in 2003 to meet with troops without the public's knowledge.(Tim Sloan/AFP/Getty Images)\nIt is hard to say overall whether Thanksgiving diners have gotten longer or shorter, but according to theU.S. Department of Agriculture'sEconomic Research Service, people typically spend around 128 minutes on meal preparation and cleanup, 89 minutes on eating and drinking, and about 148 minutes socializing, according to a long-term analysis conducted between 2003 and 2015.\nAccording to the National Turkey Federation, 94% of Americans plan to celebrate Thanksgiving.\nThe group added that 87% of those who celebrate say turkey is part of their holiday tradition, with 74% planning to serve an entire bird.\nAn archival photograph of President Gerald R.

We hunt for deals, compare prices and try to stretch our dollars a little further. What few people think about is the cost that gets added at the very moment we tap or insert a credit card. It\u2019s called a swipe fee, and it hurts consumers and small businesses alike.\nEvery time you pay with a credit card, the bank and the card network take a percentage of the purchase. For each $100 spent, anywhere from $2 to $4 goes to them even before the store gets the rest. Most shoppers never notice. And with razor-thin profits in retail and food industries, that 2% to 4% can be as much or more than the small business\u00a0makes\u00a0on the sale.\nIn 2024, these swipe fees added a\u00a0record $187 billion total, or about $1,400 in extra costs for every household. Swipeflation is real. That helps explain why more stores now add credit card fees or offer discounts for paying with cash. A recent WalletHub\u00a0survey\u00a0found that 80% of consumers reported paying a surcharge on a credit card purchase in the past year.\nKURT 'THE CYBER GUY' KNUTSSON'S TIPS FOR SAFE HOLIDAY SHOPPING\nShop owners and restaurateurs are not trying to nickel-and-dime customers. They\u2019re just trying to entice customers to use lower-cost forms of payment like cash or debit, which don\u2019t come with the same high swipe fees that credit card companies charge. After years of inflation, higher rent, increased labor costs and rising supply prices, they are just trying to stay in business. About 92% of small business owners say their\u00a0costs\u00a0have increased since 2020, and rising costs still top their list of\u00a0concerns\u00a0in 2025.\nThis holiday season, be careful how you pay for your gifts to avoid \"swipeflation.\"(iStock)\nThe irony is that inflation is a boon for credit card company profits. As restaurants, groceries and household goods get more expensive, card companies collect more money without offering anything additional in return. Picture your local caf\u00e9 after a day of shopping. The cost of a basic meal has climbed about 40% since 2019 due toinflation in food and labor costs. What used to be a $15 burger, fries, and drink now costs $21. Families pay more at the counter, and credit card companies come out ahead because they collect a percentage of every sale.\nPROTECT YOUR DATA BEFORE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SCAMS STRIKE\nMany consumers stick with credit cards because they want the rewards. Airline miles, hotel points or cash back can feel like a perk. But research\u00a0shows\u00a0that the credit card rewards game only works out well for the very highest earners. When you factor in how built-in swipe fees increase the cost of almost everything consumers buy, most of us actually lose between $300 to $500 each year, even after counting credit card rewards.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThere is good news. Consumers have more control over these costs than they might think, which could come in handy during the biggest shopping season of the year. A few small changes can help youprotect your walletand support the local businesses you care about.\nFirst, take a moment to read the merchant\u2019s policy on credit card fees. Sometimes it\u2019s on a sign at check-out; sometimes it\u2019s at the bottom of the bill. Consider taking advantage of discounts merchants offer when paying with cash or debit. If the business doesn\u2019t offer a discount, you might ask them to consider that option in the future. Otherwise, they are probably building in the swipe fee into the cost of everything, even if you pay with cash.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nYou can also apply these tips onGiving Tuesday. The same 2% to 4% swipe fees apply to online donations made with credit cards as well. Using a debit card or sending money directly from a bank account helps your donation go further.\nMillions of Americans will swipe their cards without a second thought this Black Friday. Be an informed consumer and know before you swipe. Choosing how to pay can be just as important as choosing where to shop. Behind every one of those transactions is a small business trying to keep its doors open and keep prices reasonable for shoppers. Understanding swipeflation, and adjusting how you pay, can make a real difference for both your budget and your community.\nKaren Harned is a small business advocate and former executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Legal Center.

Building on the Trump administration\u2019s progress in rare earths, the U.S. government should incentivize domestic production of several dozen critical inputs for semiconductors and data centers, including various chemicals and hardware components, as well as essential materials for quantum computing and biotechnology, like cooling equipment and drug inputs.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nGovernment action is also needed to mobilizeprivate investmenttoward quantum computing and biotechnology.

Incentivizing private investment into biomanufacturing hubs nationwide would help smaller firms bring new technologies to market by co-funding shared manufacturing infrastructure and easing regulations for expansion.\nWhile economic security begins at home, America is not alone in this race. The European Union, Japan and South Korea have pledged investments that could help strengthen U.S. manufacturing and critical supply chains.

Ranchers and agricultural economists alike say rebuilding will take years andbeef pricesaren\u2019t likely to ease anytime soon.\n\"The biggest thing has been drought,\" said Eric Belasco, head of the agricultural economics department at Montana State University.\nBEEF PRICES ARE CLOSE TO RECORD HIGHS \u2014 BUT AMERICANS AREN\u2019T CUTTING BACK\nHe said years of dry weather have wiped out grasslands across the West and Plains, leaving ranchers without enough feed or water to sustain their herds. Many have been forced to sell cattle early, even the cows needed to produce the next generation of calves, making it hard to rebuild.\n\"It\u2019s not going to be a quick fix, you\u2019re not going to solve it overnight,\" Belasco told Fox News Digital.\nRanchers have sold off many of their cattle in order to cope with rising prices.(Melissa Phillip/Houston Chronicle/Getty Images)\nBelasco said the aftereffects of years of drought are still being felt and until ranchers can rebuild their herds, consumers will keep paying the price.\n\"The primary reason you see prices so high is because we haven\u2019t seen any kind of inventory rebuilding,\" he said. \"Until you see that rebuild, you probably won\u2019t see prices coming back down again.\"\nThat slow rebuilding is a challenge for the cattle industry, according to Derrell Peel, a professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University.\n\"The fact of the matter is there\u2019s really nothing anybody can do to change this very quickly,\" Peel said. \"We\u2019re in a tight supply situation that took several years to develop, and it\u2019ll take several years to get out of it.\"\nPeel, who specializes in livestock marketing, said there\u2019s no quick way to ease pressure on beef prices, since it takes roughly two years to bring animals to market and several years to rebuild herds.\nTRUMP'S BEEF IMPORT PLAN IGNORES KEY ISSUE SQUEEZING AMERICAN CATTLE RANCHERS\nEven as ranchers wait for herds to recover, parched conditions are working against them, turning pastures to dust and feed into a luxury.\nResearch from the Kansas City Federal Reserve found that with each step up in drought severity, cattle-producing regions see about a 12% drop in hay production, a 5% rise in hay prices, a 1% reduction in herd size and a 4% decrease in farm income.\nTo cope, many ranchers are shrinking their herds. A 2022 Farm Bureau survey found that about two in three ranchers have sold animals off, leaving them with roughly one-third fewer cattle than before.\nRanchers and agricultural economists alike say rebuilding the cattle inventory will take years.(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post/Getty Images)\nFew people see the challenges of ranching more clearly than Cole Bolton, owner of K&C Cattle Company, whose pastures stretch along the soft edge of the Texas Hill Country.\n\"I think it's going to take a while to fix this crisis that we're in with the cattle shortage. My message to consumers is simple, folks, be patient. We've got to build back our herds,\" Bolton told Fox News Digital.\nBolton said the region, known for its red dirt and family-run ranches, has gone nearly three months without rain. While showers were finally arriving, he noted that the cattle industry has weathered one setback after another, from market turmoil to extreme conditions, over the past five years.\nThe growing strain highlights how persistent drought is reshaping the ranching industry and tightening the nation\u2019s livestock supply.\nThat pressure is being felt not just on ranches but also at thegrocery store.\nAccording to USDA data, the average retail price of beef rose from about $8.51 a pound in August 2024 to $9.85 a pound a year later, a gain of roughly 16%.\nThe \"5-market steer price\" represents what ranchers earn for live cattle before they\u2019re processed into meat. The \"farm-to-retail\" spread reflects everything that happens after that \u2013 the costs and profits tied to slaughtering, processing, packaging, shipping and selling beef in stores.\nMuch of that work \u2014 and the profits it generates \u2014 are concentrated among the industry\u2019s \"big four\"meatpackers: Tyson Foods, JBS, Cargill and National Beef.\nTogether, these data points show that while ranchers are earning slightly more for their cattle than they were a few years ago, the biggestpriceincreases are happening well after the animals leave the pasture.\nDespite the markups between the ranch and the grocery store, demand hasn\u2019t wavered.

The situation has gotten so bad that Arkansas cash crop receipts are now projected to fall by $617 million in 2025.\nAdding to these challenges for Arkansas farmers, the contrast between the steep cost of inputs (such as seed, fertilizer and diesel) and the commodity prices that farmers receive for their crops is at its highest level in 25 years. Put differently, input costs are too high and revenues are too low for many farmers to turn a profit, or at the very least, keep their businesses afloat.

Additionally, he has the attention of many young people, who Hayek noted often aren't aware of the tools out there to help them buy a home.\nGreg Sindelar, AFPI's interim president, said that the current culture in the United States \"too often diminishes traditional aspirations,\" like homeownership and building a family, which has taken a toll on younger generations.\nEven Democrats tend to agree. Former Democrat congressman and ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post in August explaining how the increased difficulty of homeownership is depressing young men, particularly due to the fact that buying a home is often seen as such a pivotal part of achieving the American Dream.\n\"Rising costs, stagnant wages, regulatory burdens, and a culture that too often diminishes traditional aspirations have left millions feeling directionless and forgotten,\" Sindelar said. \"AFPI is committed to reversing this trend by advancing meaningful, actionable policy solutions rooted in the principles of the America First movement.\"\nBIPARTISAN PLAN AIMS TO MAKE THE AMERICAN DREAM AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR MILLIONS OF FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS\nThe new initiative, announced Friday, laid out a list of policy proposals it plans to advance across government of all levels.\nSingle family homes in a residential neighborhood in San Marcos, Texas, on Tuesday, March 12, 2024.(Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nAmong those proposals is a push to eliminate capital gains taxes on first home sales as long as they reinvest in another home within the following five years. This proposal is aimed at mirroring the spirit of President Donald Trump's \"Opportunity Zones\" aimed at accelerating wealth and economic development for low-income communities.\n\"The average first-time homebuyer in America is now 40-years-old. 40. years. Old. That is far beyond the optimal age to get married and start a family,\" \u00a0Johnson told Fox News Digital. \"The fight for homeownership is a fight for the survival of our culture and civilization. Young Americans cannot build families without homes, and a nation without families cannot survive. The American Dream is dying before our eyes. This is a generational betrayal, and we must reverse it for our children and for their future. This was the final policy priority of Charlie Kirk. We will deliver and save the American Dream.\"\nAnother proposal includes a push for the creation of \"Home Savings Accounts\" similar to a Health Savings Account (HSA) that allows individuals to contribute pre-tax dollars to pay for their healthcare needs.\nOne proposal also includes a plan to reduce regulations and increase incentives across states and localities that have restricted the development of newhousing supply.One example they point to is \"green building standards,\" which the initiative says bloats costs for builders.

It will give families that marry and have a child within five years a $10,000 reduction on their mortgage through a refundabletax credit.The initiative will also push to double the child-tax credit for households filing their taxes jointly and own a home, or are planning to own one.\n\"Home ownership is unlocking the American dream,\" Burkentine said. \"We need deregulation and implementation of meaningful policies to help young Americans reach this dream. I\u2019m proud to partner with AFPI to make housing great again.\"\nFox News Digital added following publication that Johnson tapped former HUD Secretary under Trump Ben Carson and housing developer Michael Burkentine as the initiative's first two board members.

If we pause, China will sprint past us, and we\u2019ll end up importing, not exporting, the technology of the future.\u00a0In fact,a new report in The Wall Street Journalhighlighted how the AI race against China is as \"consequential\" as the Cold War because the technology has the \"potential to influence large swaths of the global population.\"\nAMERICA'S SECRET WEAPON TO CRUSH CHINA IN THE GLOBAL AI RACE\nThis is why we\u2019re both proud to launch theAI Infrastructure Coalition(AIIC) to ensure that America finishes first.\nThe next five years will see $5 trillion inglobal AI infrastructure spending, yielding $15.7 trillion in economic value over the following decade.

{"title": "Fox News Poll: Voters say White House is doing more harm than good on economy", "date": "2025-11-19", "body": "Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the latest on the affordability crisis and Dave Portnoy's comments on why he left the Democratic Party.\nUnhappy with theeconomy. Pain with prices. Unsure about Trump administration policies. It adds up to high disapproval among the president\u2019s loyal constituencies.\nHere are six takeaways from the latest Fox News national survey.\n\u2014 Some 76% of voters view the economy negatively. That\u2019s worse than the 67% who felt that way in July and the 70% who said the same at the end of former President Biden\u2019s term.\n\u2014 Large numbers, overall and among Republicans, say their costs for groceries, utilities, healthcare and housing have gone up this year.\nFOX NEWS VOTER POLL \u2013 CHANGE CANDIDATE MAMDANI DEFEATS LEGACY POLITICAL FIGURES\n\u2014 Voters blame the president. About twice as many say President Donald Trump, rather than Biden, is responsible for the current economy. And three times as many say Trump\u2019s economic policies have hurt them (they said the same about Biden\u2019s last year). Plus, approval of how Trump is handling the economy hit a new low, and disapproval of his overall job performance hit record highs among core supporters.\n\u2014 After the government shutdown, the GOP and the Democratic Party have lower favorable ratings, and roughly 6 in 10 say the president and lawmakers on both sides don\u2019t care about people like them.\n\u2014 Voters think Republicans have a better plan for border security, immigration and crime, while Democrats are seen as better on affordability, wages, healthcare and climate.\n\u2014 Views are divided on Trump\u2019s peace deals making the world safer and the administration\u2019s strategy for dealing with alleged drug-traffickers.\nHere are the numbers behind those findings.\nTrump\u2019sjob performance drew career-high disapproval among men, White voters and those without a college degree.\nEighty-six percent of Republicans approve, down from 92% in March.\nAmong all voters, 41% approve of the job Trump is doing, while 58% disapprove. Only once have his ratings been lower and that was during his first term, 38-57% in October 2017. Two months ago, it was 46-54%.\nFor comparison,Biden\u2019smarks were a bit better at the same point in his presidency: 44% approved and 54% disapproved in November 2021.\nForty percent of voters rate their personal finances as excellent/good, while 60% say only fair/poor, which is about where things stood a year ago. Ratings are notably bad (roughly 70% negative), among non-college voters, Hispanics, Blacks, independents and those under age 45. For those with household income below $50,000, fully 79% rate their finances negatively.\nFOX NEWS VOTER POLL: NEW JERSEY GOVERNORSHIP REMAINS DEMOCRATIC WITH SHERRILL WIN\nWhen it comes to the national economy versus personal finances, evaluations are also negative. Most say conditions are only fair/poor (76%), and fewer than one in five think inflation is completely/mostly under control (18%).\nCompared to a year ago, voters say costs have increased for utilities (78%), healthcare (67%), housing (66%) and gasoline (54%). And 85% their grocery prices went up this year, including 60% who say costs increased \"a lot.\" Majorities of Republicans agree with majorities of Democrats and independents that costs have gone up on each of these items except gas.\nFOX NEWS VOTER POLL: CALIFORNIA VOTERS OK CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING PLAN\nAt the end of Biden\u2019s term, voters said by a wide 30-point margin that his economic policies had done more to hurt than help their families, driven by three-quarters of Republicans saying they had been harmed. The new survey shows almost identical results, as voters say by a 31-point margin that Trump\u2019s economic policies have hurt rather than helped them, driven by the three-quarters of Democrats saying they have been harmed. In December 2018, during his first term, only 21% overall said they had been hurt by Trump\u2019s policies, including just one-third of Democrats.\nBy a nearly 2-to-1 margin, voters say Trump is more responsible for the current economy than Biden (62% vs. 32%). Unsurprisingly, there\u2019s a large partisan gap, as Democrats are nearly 40 percentage points more likely than Republicans to blame Trump. Somewhat surprisingly though, 42% of Republicans blame him, while a 53% majority says Biden is responsible. Among independents, 62% say Trump and 29% Biden.\nA larger share believes the Republicans have a better plan for securing the border, dealing with illegal immigrants, reducing crime and reducing the federal budget deficit.\u00a0Democrats are preferred for addressing climate change, reducing the cost of healthcare, raising wages and making things more affordable. The parties are about equal on the issue of job creation.\nCongressional Democrats said the shutdown was about extending subsidies for Obamacare. The 2010 healthcare law remains popular, as 54% have a favorable opinion of it. Although much of that comes from nearly 9 in 10 Democrats viewing it positively.\u00a0Not only do voters think Democrats have a better plan for reducing healthcare costs, but Trump received his lowest approval on the issue of healthcare.\n\"The situation isn\u2019t complicated,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps run the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"People are struggling to afford necessities and blaming those in charge. What\u2019s interesting is watching Democrats gain politically from a problem they arguably caused \u2014 and that crushed them in 2024. But that\u2019s politics.\"\nWhile many families say thegovernment shutdowncaused them severe (10%) or moderate hardship (35%), more than half say it was not a hardship at all (54%).\nThe shutdown wasn\u2019t a political winner for anyone. Nearly two-thirds disapprove of how Trump (62%), congressional Republicans (63%) and congressional Democrats (64%) handled it.\nA record low 39% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party, down from 42% in July. Another 39% have positive views of the GOP, down from 44% this summer. For Trump, it\u2019s 40% positive, down from 43% in September and 50% in January.\nBut it\u2019s Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumerwhose marks have deteriorated the most. A record low 22% view him favorably versus 54% unfavorably, for a net rating of minus-32 points. His ratings were underwater by 16 points in January. Among Democrats, positive views of Schumer went from 51% in January to 38% today.\nThe overall marks for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took a smaller hit (from minus-2 to minus-10), as did Speaker of the House Mike Johnson\u2019s (from minus-9 to minus-15) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune\u2019s (from minus-10 to minus-12). Many are unable to evaluate Thune (54%), Jeffries (38%) and Johnson (31%).\nVoters also think their political leaders don\u2019t care about people like them, as roughly 6 in 10 say Democrats (59%) and Republicans (65%) in Congress and Trump (63%) don\u2019t care.\nTrump\u2019s job ratings onforeign policyare underwater: 43% approve, while 55% disapprove. Yet views are more evenly divided on whether his recent peace deals will make the world safer or less safe (37% apiece), with one quarter saying not much difference.\u00a0And 49% favor the U.S. military using deadly force against presumed drug trafficking boats departing from Venezuela, while 47% oppose those efforts.\nThe president receives his top marks on border security (53% approve). Nearly half approve of his handling of immigration (46%), while a new low approves on the economy (38%), and about one-third approve on tariffs (35%) and healthcare (34%).\nPoll-pourri\nThe electorate believes the different branches of government are failing to live up to their constitutional obligations. Two-thirds are concerned about Congress (64%) and the Supreme Court (63%) not doing the checks and balances that they should and are giving too much of their constitutional authority to the president. At the same time, about half (47%) are concerned the judicial branch is obstructing Trump\u2019s constitutional authority to carry out his agenda.\nCLICK HERE FORCROSSTABSANDTOPLINE\nConducted November 14-17, 2025, under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,005 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file.

Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo.,on legislation theyhope will finally give millions of homebuyers some relief, as the dream of ownership remains a distant goal for many.\nIt would do so by targeting the federal government's HOME Investments Partnership Program, which provides grants to state and local jurisdictions to build affordable housing.\nThat program, Flood said, has not been significantly amended since the early 1990s.\nTRUMP'S RUMORED HOUSING EMERGENCY WOULD BE A 'GAME-CHANGER,' KEY GOP LAWMAKER SAYS\nA \"New Low Price\" sign in front of a home in Crockett, California, on Sept. 24, 2025.(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\"Traditionally, the program that we're remodeling\u2026 has favored multifamily.

If the city of Columbus, Nebraska, gets $2.5 million from the Home Partnership program, the city can go in and expand stormwater and sewer and maybe even pavement and streets,\" he explained.\n\"And suddenly, instead of being a $50,000 lot, it's a $20,000 lot. Instead of being a $300,000 home, you know, it's a $270,000 home because the cost of that was ultimately given to the city, and the city used it to build city infrastructure, not making the developer do that.\"\nRep.

Some claim higher electricity prices are due to PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s \"one big beautiful bill,\" which curtailed subsidies for \"cheap\" wind and solar installations. Others blame AI\u2019s rapidly expanding appetite for electricity, while some blame inflation. None of these charges hold up under scrutiny.\nBut shifting blame, usually with the help of a complicit media, helps with the only thing that matters to most politicians: seizing political power.\nThis is readily seen in California Democrat Gov.Gavin Newsom\u2019s trip to Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, to rub elbows with the global elite at the U.N.\u2019s COP30 global climate conference on Nov. 11. Newsom, an all-but-declared candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 2028, slammed the Trump administration for not attending the confab, accusing the president of \"handing the future to China,\" presumably in the category of selling solar panels embedded with secret kill switches.\nNewsom went on to say that \"We\u2019re not turning backwards to the failed policies of the past \u2014California is fighting for a clean-energy future, even as\u00a0President Trump bends the knee to his Gulf-State patrons and takes a nap as the world burns.\" Newsom also claimed that California is now operating its grid on \"two-thirds clean energy,\" with California operating on 100% non-fossil-fuel energy for at least part of the day nine out of 10 days this year.\nNEWSOM CLAIMS TRUMP IS \u2018HANDING THE FUTURE TO CHINA\u2019 AT BRAZILIAN CLIMATE CONFAB THAT WH SKIPPED\nSolar power energy microgrid in California, as part of that state's green energy push.(Photo by SANDY HUFFAKER/AFP via Getty Images)\nBut California now has thenation\u2019s second-highest electricity prices, only behind Hawaii, with the Golden State\u2019s electricity prices rising the most of any state since 2010: 127%, according to a new report from Jonathan A. Lesser, Ph.D., a senior fellow with the National Center for Energy Analytics.\nThe truth that Newsom doesn\u2019t want Californians \u2014 or Democratic primary voters \u2014 to know is that \"green\" energy is expensive energy. That\u2019s because, \"60% of the time, (wind and solar) works every time\" to borrow from the much-memed comedy \"Anchorman.\" And, it\u2019s very costly to make sure the power is on when wind and solar aren\u2019t producing.\nThis, Lesser notes, is one of the main culprits in rising electricity costs.\nLIZ PEEK: TRUMP WHITE HOUSE FIRED UP ABOUT KING COAL\u2019S RETURN TO POWER\nThe Biden-Harris administration\u2019sreckless push for subsidized wind and solar \u2014and California\u2019s before that and since \u2014 has destabilized our grid and forced consumers to foot the bill for fortifying unreliable \"green\" energy with reliable gas power and expensive batteries \u2014 the latter of limited utility.\nFrom the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2025, average residential electricity rates across the U.S. surged by about 63%, according to\u00a0Energy Information Administration (EIA)\u00a0data. But the pain isn\u2019t evenly distributed.States like Massachusettsand California not only endured the steepest hikes, but now boast two of the nation's highest rates \u2014 over 30 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases.\nCritics peddle all sorts of excuses for these increases. One target is data centers, those power-hungry hubs fueling AI and cloud computing. Sure, they consume a lot of power \u2014 Virginia, a data center hotspot, has seen demand rise. But Virginia\u2019s rates? Below-average increases and still under the national norm. If data centers are the villain, why isn\u2019t the Old Dominion suffering like California?\nTRUMP'S UN SPEECH REVEALS INCONVENIENT TRUTH OF MASSIVE GREEN ENERGY COSTS\nA recent International Renewable Energy Agency report touts falling costs for renewables. But as Lesser\u2019s analysis shows, that\u2019s a half-truth at best. Subsidies like the federal production tax credit \u2014 now $27.50 per megawatt-hour \u2014 let wind and solar operators undercut the market with negative bids, distorting wholesale prices and squeezing out reliable baseload plants \u2014 which end up not being built.\nHere\u2019s the missing link the green advocates ignore: the shift in our generating mix. Between 2010 and 2024, U.S. electricity capacity grew 16% to 1,325 gigawatts, outpacing a mere 5% rise in retail sales. Sounds good, right? Wrong. Dispatchable sources \u2014 coal, gas and nuclear, which can ramp up on demand \u2014 plummeted by 80 gigawatts. Intermittent wind and solar ballooned seven-fold, to 278 gigawatts.\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom traveled to Brazil for the COP30 World Climate Conference, touting his state's energy policies while the Trump administration skipped the event.(Larissa Schwedes/picture alliance via Getty Images)\nThis trend accelerated in 2025: More than 1,900 megawatts of fossil fuel retired by July, with another 12,600 megawatts slated for shutdown by year\u2019s end and into 2026. What's replacing them? Moresubsidized wind, solar, and pricey batteries.\nTRUMP'S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS\nIt\u2019s policy malpractice. States like New Jersey and New York forcedpremature closures of reliable power plantssuch as Oyster Creek nuclear in 2018 and Indian Point in 2021, which powered a quarter of New York City\u2019s needs.\nBiden-era EPA rules, now being rolled back under Trump, would have shuttered most coal plants by 2032. Mandates for cars to have \"zero-emissions\" by 2035 in places like California ignore reality. Where will they get the electricity?

Not because they are wrong about AI's risks, but because they have failed to offer Americans a vision for the economic transformation ahead. While they focus on managing problems, others are defining what comes next. One side is talking about building the future, the other about constraining it.\nIn November, at Nvidia's GTC conference in Washington, hundreds of technologists and business leaders celebrated a great American success story: Jensen Huang and the company he co-founded. \u00a0The speakers praised PresidentDonald Trumpfor his administration's approach to AI. Many in the audience saw an administration that's for removing barriers, enabling scale and improving American competitiveness.\nThis should be a wake-up call for Democrats, who have failed to seize the opportunity so far to speak not only to AI's risks, but to its potential for broad economic transformation.Democrats haveasked plenty of questions about AI\u2019s safety, its biases and its effect on the job market.\nBut so far, Democrats have treated these as separate problems to manage rather than as pieces of a larger question: how do we shape this transformation so it creates opportunity for everyone, not just profits for a few? That's the conversation Americans deserve.\nTHE NEW ARMS RACE IS FOR COMPUTE \u2014 AND AMERICA CAN\u2019T AFFORD TO FALL BEHIND\nD.C. Democrats need to reclaim the issue of AI from Republicans.(iStock)\nTheelite consensus in Washingtonfocuses on one goal: optimize America's AI capabilities as a whole. A recent Foreign Affairs\u00a0essay\u00a0by former Biden administration officials captures the \"grand bargain\" between government and industry: more infrastructure and capacity for big companies. Workers, communities and startups beyond the frontier are afterthoughts.\u00a0Build first, assume prosperity trickles down later. It's a familiar strategy that hasn't delivered before.\u00a0Republicans mostly embrace this framework as well, but Republican populists smartly recognize its shortcomings.\nWhat this means going forward: Large companies positioned to capture trillions. Worker displacement a problem to solve later. Communities provide land, energy, and water without guarantees they'll share in prosperity. The Biden administration's 2023 executive order was comprehensive on safety testing but said little about prosperity, workers or communities.\nPast waves of automation left communities hollowed out and workers without pathways forward. Innovation rarely distributes opportunity without deliberate efforts to strengthen workers, communities and local economies.\nRecent polling in swing states shows AI sentiment declining as workers connect the technology to job insecurity. We all lose. Not to China, but to ourselves. The skepticism crosses ideological lines. On the far right, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon warned earlier this year that entry-level jobs will be destroyed. On the far left, Democratic Socialists see AI as another vehicle for corporate power. Both responses cede the possibility that AI could distribute opportunity rather than concentrate wealth.\nTRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA\nAn alternative vision would optimize for the flourishing of American Davids: our workers, families and innovative startups.\u00a0Large companies' long-term success depends on this foundation too. It's not about slowing down. The capital is moving fast regardless. The question is whether we structure that rapid deployment to create broadly shared prosperity or concentrated extraction. Aimless speed creates the political backlash that actually threatens progress. Speed with a plan creates sustainable advancement.\nWe've done this before. Land grant universities gave communities stakes in research and education. Rural electrification co-ops gave farmers ownership, not just access. The GI Bill gave veterans leverage to build fulfilling careers, not just short-term compensation.Alaska's Permanent Fundgives every resident dividends from oil extraction on public lands.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nNow imagine: National block grants enabling states to createpublic compute for startupsand regional economies. Worker transition funds that workers control, not programs they endure. Equity stakes when companies profit from public infrastructure give communities ownership of their future. Third party assurance markets to accelerate responsible innovation at scale. These are ideas to prompt discussion with the American people. This moment calls for a national project worthy of American ingenuity.\nDemocrats have a long history with this thinking. Rural electrification and railroad policy ensured broad access. Today, Arizona Democratic Sen.Mark Kelly's \"AI for America\" proposal represents the kind of bigger vision we should debate.\nDemocrats have an opportunity now to pursue an alternative path and offer our country a national project that centers AI advances as the critical innovation for a prosperous, healthy, and safe future for all Americans.\nAimless speed creates the political backlash that actually threatens progress. Speed with a plan creates sustainable advancement.New technologyalone is good. But it's even better when paired with policy and market approaches that emphasize economic security, opportunity and dignity for the American people.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nDemocrats are flat-footed. Anxiety is rising among populists on the right and left. The urgent question now is whether either party will challenge the elite consensus that treats the impacts of economic transformation on workers, communities and startups as either imaginary or problems to solve later.\nThis moment demands a vision that accounts for all Americans, our workers, communities and startup entrepreneurs most especially.\nGaurab Bansal is executive director of Responsible Innovation Labs and former deputy assistant to President Barack Obama.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-losing-ai-because-big-messaging-problem"}

And you will see this become the number one issue in the 2026 midterms.\nFREE MEAL IS MOTIVATING NEARLY 1 IN 3 SINGLES TO SAY 'YES' TO DATE, NEW REPORT FINDS\nIn the past,younger consumers led the charge in dining trendsby paying more for organic, sustainable or fast-casual meals that felt upscale but affordable. Now those same consumers are financially maxed out. Even though many are making decent incomes, the real after-tax wages simply aren\u2019t keeping up with thedebt and overall inflation.\nThis isn\u2019t just about burrito bowls or Mediterranean grain bowls. It\u2019s a signal that consumer behavior is changing across the country and this trend is going to continue given the larger picture of sustainable housing affordability. Younger Americans are voting with their wallets, and they\u2019re saying: we\u2019re done paying $20 for lunch.\nGen Z isn\u2019t anti-burrito. They\u2019re giving up dining out, and they're reacting to a generation's broken financial equation. With inflation eating away at their paychecks and debt stacking up, all types of small luxuries are getting cut.(iStock)\nFast casual dining chains built their success on speed, quality, and a perceived value gap between fast-food and full-service restaurants. But that middle ground is now under siege and people are returning to dollar-value menus at fast-food restaurants anddiscount grocery stores like Aldi.\nAMERICA'S PIZZA BOOM GOES COLD AS DELIVERY APPS TAKE BIGGER SLICE OF THE PIE\nCurrently,value focused chains like McDonald\u2019s, Chili\u2019s, and Domino\u2019sare gaining share. When inflation bites, people trade down. They still want convenience without paying the premium price tag. The same $12-to-$15 spent on a fully loaded bowl can cover two homemade dinners or a week\u2019s worth of frozen meals.\nFor anyonerunning or buying a restaurant, your customer base is shifting. The 25- to-35-year-old demographic, once the lifeblood of fast-casual dining, is disappearing faster than guacamole on a Friday night.\n(For anyone running or buying a restaurant, your customer base is shifting. The 25- to-35-year-old demographic, once the lifeblood of fast-casual dining, is disappearing faster than guacamole on a Friday night.)\nIf your concept relies heavily on younger diners, it\u2019s time to rethink pricing, promotions and loyalty. People still love good food, but they\u2019re searching for value. Boatwright has already said Chipotle won\u2019t chase customers by cutting prices. That\u2019s admirable, but it\u2019s risky and stocks like CAVA and Chipotle could feel significant pain. Holding the line on price when consumers feel squeezed could hurt traffic much more than you think.\nGEN Z DRINKERS LEAVE BARTENDERS FRUSTRATED WITH SHRINKING TIPS AS 'TERRIBLE' TREND EMERGES\nFrom a valuation standpoint, buyers are looking harder at guest demographics, frequency trends and economic resilience. A restaurant that relies on young professionals may see its valuation dip unless it can prove stability in a downturn.\nGen Z isn\u2019t anti-burrito. They\u2019ve woken up to realize that it\u2019s not worth the mental and financial stress clawing their way out of debt.

Another series of spots featured MSNBC hosts promising, \"Same mission, new name.\"\nMSNBC announced it is rebranding as \"MS NOW\" beginning Nov. 15.(Versant)\nThe name change sparked mixed reactions from inside the network.\nMaddow told The New York Times she was initially \"annoyed\" by the name change but is now \"kind of happy about it.\"\nMaddow called it \"a hook to reintroduce ourselves to people, to reintroduce ourselves to the country, and remind our viewers what it is they like about us.\"\nOne staffer previously toldFox News Digital, \"I don't get it\" and swiped that the new name wasn't meaningful. A second MSNBC insider said it was good for the new network to have similar initials for the sake of familiarity with loyal viewers, but that MS NOW was far from perfect.

Andrea Mitchell, who ended her long-running MSNBC program \"Andrea Mitchell Reports\" in February, will remain with NBC as its chief Washington and foreign affairs correspondent.\u00a0Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart departed MSNBC earlier this year and will continue anchoring \"NBC Nightly News Saturday,\" as well as Noticias Telemundo.\nLIBERAL MEDIA SPLIT: WHO GETS WHAT IN THE MESSY NBC-MSNBC DIVORCE?\nNBC reporters who will be part of MS NOW include justice beat reporters Ken Dilanian and Ryan Reilly, national correspondent Jacob Soboroff, White House correspondent Vaughn Hillyard and internet reporter Brandy Zadrozny. A slew of other staffers will also make the leap from NBC to MS NOW, like Meghan Rafferty, the former executive producer of \"NBC Nightly News\" who will serve as MS NOW's vice president of news standards.\nWillie Geist, who currently hosts \"Sunday TODAY\" for NBC and co-hosts \"Morning Joe\" on MSNBC, landed a rare deal where he is able to maintain both roles at each network after the separation.\nAnd as part of the divorce, NBC gets to keep the house, meaning MSNBC has packed up its boxes and left Rockefeller Center in New York City and vacated NBC's Washington, D.C., bureau near the U.S. Capitol. MSNBC has also had to build a news-gathering division from scratch, involving a huge hiring spree to fill its newsroom.\nMSNBC staffers had to vacate NBC's studio at New York City's Rockefeller Center as part of the corporate split.(Joseph A.

This includes almost 1,000 workers who are making more than the president's $400,000 per year salary, 31,452 non-War Department federal employees who made more than every governor of all 50 states and 793,537 people making $100,000 or more. Those making $300,000 or more have seen an 84% increase since 2020, while there has similarly been an 82% increase in those earning $200,000 or more, the report points out.\nDuring Open The Book's investigation, the fiscal watchdog group also found that the names of 383,000 federal workers across 56 different agencies were redacted, amounting to a total of $38.3 billion in pay. According to Open The Books CEO John Hart, \"You can't have accountability without visibility.\"\n\"The Trump administration has a historic opportunity to bring much-needed transparency to the administrative state. While federal employees don't add as much to the debt as safety net programs, defense and overall agency spending, they are an indicator of government's growth,\" Hart said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"Our investigators found far too many redactions and blind spots that DOGE should have already fixed.

{"title": "Trump\u2019s\u00a050-year\u00a0mortgage just introduces a new kind of debt", "date": "2025-11-12", "body": "Former Trump economic advisor Stephen Moore joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the possibility of President Donald Trump proposing a 50-year mortgage to incentivize young homebuyers.\nThe montage of the\u00a0American Dream\u00a0begins with a front door and a mortgage. PresidentDonald Trumpis correct to say that the dream is slipping out of reach for too many families. Home prices have skyrocketed, mortgage rates have doubled since 2021, and young Americans are\u00a0finding\u00a0it more challenging than ever to buy a home and put down roots.\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that the administration is\u00a0exploring\u00a0new ways to \"make housing affordable again.\" One of those ideas, a50-year\u00a0fixed-rate mortgage, promises smaller monthly payments by stretching out the life of the loan.\nBut the problem isn\u2019t the rates or lengths of\u00a0mortgages; it\u2019s the cost of the house.\nPresident Donald Trump is correct to say that the American dream of homeownership is slipping out of reach for too many families.(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\nExtending loan terms just\u00a0spreads\u00a0the pain over more years. Longer\u00a0mortgages\u00a0might lower the monthly bill, but they multiply the total debt. On a $400,000 loan at 6% interest, a\u00a050-year\u00a0mortgage means paying roughly $1.26 million over the life of the loan, more than triple the original amount. After 20 years, you\u2019d still owe almost $350,000.\nHOUSING COSTS ARE CRUSHING FAMILIES \u2013 HERE\u2019S THE WAY OUT\nThe real challenge is that the government has made ittoo expensive to buildand buy homes in the first place. Washington and local governments pile on costs at every step through\u00a0tariffs, taxes, fees and endless red tape. Builders can\u2019t build affordably when they\u2019re forced to navigate an obstacle course of regulation and delay.\nEven Bill Pulte, President Trump\u2019s housing chief and a longtime homebuilder himself, has\u00a0acknowledged\u00a0how high interest rates and housing costs are \"really hurting people.\" He\u2019s right about the pain families are feeling, but the solution is lower costs. As any economist can tell you, affordability begins with more supply, not more subsidies.\nMackenzie Bishop, a homebuilder with\u00a0Abrazos Homes\u00a0in Albuquerque,\u00a0recently laid out\u00a0the math in blunt terms.Local taxes and feesadd more than $40,000 to the cost of every new home before a single nail is hammered. Add property tax increases of 50 to 70% on multifamily projects, and new construction grinds to a halt. Multiply that across the country, and it\u2019s no wonder builders can\u2019t keep up with demand or why the homes that do get built are\u00a0out of reach\u00a0for working families.\nWHY YOUR PARENTS COULD AFFORD A HOUSE ON ONE SALARY \u2013 BUT YOU CAN\u2019T ON TWO\nIt\u2019s the\u00a0same story nationwide. Tariffs have\u00a0raised the prices\u00a0of building materials like lumber, steel and concrete. Meanwhile,\u00a0permitting\u00a0and environmental reviews can delay projects for years, driving up financing costs and draining the incentive to build at all.\nThese are the hidden taxes that keepAmerica\u2019s housing supplyartificially scarce, and that scarcity \u2013 not the length of the mortgage \u2013 is what drives prices higher.\nEven as\u00a0inflation\u00a0has cooled from its peak, prices are\u00a0still rising\u00a0about 3% a year. \"Sticky\" costs like rent, insurance and shelter remain stubbornly high. That means families\u2019 paychecks are\u00a0stretched thin\u00a0before they even start saving for a down payment. The Federal Reserve may eventually cut interest rates, but unless we fix the underlying supply problem, housing will remain unaffordable no matter the loan term.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe good news is that conservatives already know how to fix this. Instead of inventing new forms of debt, we can make it easier and\u00a0cheaper to build\u00a0the homes Americans need. That means streamlining permitting andcutting the bureaucracythat slows construction, eliminating tariffs that drive up the price of materials, and expanding legal immigration to rebuild the skilled trades workforce that keeps the housing market moving.\nIt also means reforming zoning laws that allow a handful of activists to block entire neighborhoods and phasing out\u00a0federal subsidies\u00a0that inflate prices by distorting credit markets. Together, these reforms would tackle the real causes of\u00a0high housing costs: scarcity, inefficiency and government overreach.\nDo those things, and the market will do what it does best: deliver abundance, innovation and opportunity.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe goal of homeownership is worth fighting for. It strengthens families, builds communities and creates generational wealth. But we can\u2019t borrow our way to prosperity. The answer to high housing costs isn\u2019t a longer mortgage; it\u2019s a lighter burden.\nPresident Trump\u2019s instinct to put working families first is right on target. The best way tomake housing affordable againis to unleash America\u2019s builders, entrepreneurs and workers, not to create a new kind of debt. Let builders build. Let markets work. Let families keep more of what they earn. That\u2019s how we restore the American Dream:\u00a0build, baby, build.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM PATRICK M. BRENNER\nPatrick M.

They framed their inquiries at times around two legal principles, known as the major questions and non-delegation doctrines, and scrutinized the text of the emergency law Trump invoked to enact the tariffs.\nJustice Clarence Thomas set the stage for the nearly three-hour arguments. In the first question of the day, Thomas, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, asked Sauer to \"spend a few minutes on why exactly the major questions doctrine doesn't apply to the president in this case.\"\nBARRETT AND SOTOMAYOR TAG-TEAM TRUMP LAWYER ON TARIFF POWERS\nSupreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor, left, and Clarence Thomas pose for their official portrait inside the court\u2019s East Conference Room on Oct. 7, 2022, in Washington, D.C.(Alex Wong/Getty Images)\nUnder the principle, courts look to make sure the executive branch has not used a vaguely written law to carry out an act of major national significance, like worldwide tariffs.\nSauer responded that the tariffs case, which involved foreign trade deals, was a \"particularly poor fit\" to apply the major questions doctrine because courts should give broader power to the president on foreign policy matters.\nBrent\u00a0Skorup, a legal fellow at the CATO Institute, which has sided against Trump in the case, told Fox News Digital he has seen two trends emerge from the Supreme Court. One is a long-term trend where the high court is highly deferential to the president on overseas matters, but the other, he said, was a more recent use of the major questions doctrine.\nCourts have increasingly used the doctrine to demand clear statutory permission for blockbuster policies, striking down agency actions in West Virginia v. EPA andBiden v. Nebraska. Several justices asked whether that same rule applies when the president, rather than an agency, claims sweeping tariff power under the statute Trump used, which never mentions the word \"tariffs.\"\n\"It's not clear which trend will play out,\" Skorup said. \"My hunch is that most, and this was confirmed at oral arguments, most justices are probably leaning towards favoring the importers and these more recent doctrinal trends will prevail.\" He added he was encouraged by Chief Justice Roberts pressing Sauer about the matter.\n\"He seemed to think there's a major questions problem here,\" Skorup said.\nTRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER'\nA demonstrator holds a sign outside the Supreme Court as justices hear arguments on President Trump\u2019s global tariff powers on Nov. 5, 2025.(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\nTrump has beenon a rampage this week, emphasizing the perceived stakes of the case, a sign that he could be bracing for an unfavorable outcome.\nTrump claimed that if the tariffs are deemed illegal, the potential refund process could exceed $3 trillion. He said the justices were given \"wrong numbers\" about repayment costs.\n\"It would not be possible to ever make up for that kind of \u2018drubbing,\u2019\" Trump wrote on social media. \"That would truly become an insurmountable National Security Event, and devastating to the future of our Country \u2013 Possibly non-sustainable!\"\nTrump used the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to sidestep Congress' role in approving taxes and tariffs, saying the opioid epidemic and trade deficit amounted to a national emergency and justified a host of tariffs on imports from major trading partners from China and India to Canada and Mexico. Trump has touted the billions in revenue collected by the government and said it will be used to pay $2,000 to lower-income families and pay off some of the national debt.\nTRUMP\u2019S OWN SCOTUS PICKS COULD WIND UP HURTING HIM ON TARIFFS\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett and President Donald Trump are shown in a split image as the Supreme Court weighs Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers for worldwide tariffs.(Getty Images)\nBut the justices repeatedly questioned how Trump could justify bypassingCongress, especially when IEEPA was not clear on the matter. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Sonia Sotomayor, Trump and Obama appointees, respectively, grilled Sauer about how IEEPA did not spell out that the president could unilaterally enact tariffs, even if it did give the president the power to \"regulate imports.\"\nThe Supreme Court could also factor the non-delegation doctrine into its finding, either in an avoidant or direct way. The key question is, even if IEEPA could be read to allow tariffs, would that reading hand the president Congress\u2019s core tariff authority without a limiting principle?\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, seemed particularly interested in the issue, asking Sauer if Congress could \"delegate to the president the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations as he sees fit.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIf the Supreme Court were to take the avoidant route, according to Ilan Wurman, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, it could interpret IEEPA narrowly to avoid a possible finding that Congress improperly passed off its tariff authority to the president. Wurman told Fox News Digital that would be easier than directly concluding that Congress gave up its constitutional power to another branch of government.\nBut, Wurman said, \"on the other hand, every century or so the Supreme Court should strike something down under the non-delegation doctrine. Give it a little life here and there, right?\"\nA decision is expected by late June.\nAshley Oliver is a reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business, covering the Justice Department and legal affairs.

Screw over a national political party\u2026.Next\u2026\"\nSchumer isn\u2019t the only Democratic official in the crosshairs of his own party. Progressive New York City Councilman Chi Osse is apparently set to challenge House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries when the latter is up for re-election next year. Another New York representative, Richie Torres, will face off against yet another anti-Israel progressive, former Bronx Assemblyman Michael Blake. Elsewhere, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is facing a primary challenge from her own leftist lieutenant governor.\nTHE GOP'S 2026 CHALLENGE \u2014 HOLDING TRUMP'S BASE WHEN HE'S NOT ON THE BALLOT\nMeanwhile, as Democrats eat their own, Americans are discovering the truth about Obamacare.Schumer and his Senate colleagueswere fighting to prolong the enhanced subsidies established under President Joe Biden that made ACA health insurance premiums more affordable. Those subsidies were meant to expire at the end of this year. However, it turns out that premium costs without those subsidies would skyrocket, putting insurance out of reach for millions of families.\nThe subsidies under consideration were included in the American Rescue Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, both of which passed with zero Republican votes. Thus, having Democrats blame the GOP for the expiration of those payments is ridiculous.\nThe truth is that Obamacare, which covers only 7% of Americans and was also passed only with Democratic votes, is a failed program. It was meant to bring the cost of health insurance down, but never did. It was set up so that millions of young, healthy Americans would be forced to sign up as a result of the \"individual mandate,\" a tax penalty which compelled people to have health insurance whether they wanted it or not. The healthcare costs of that young cohort were expected to be low, offsetting the higher expenses of older and sicker Americans.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ended the unpopular individual mandate, thus overturning the underlying method of spreading the cost of insurance over a larger pool of people. As a result, Obamacare increasingly covered individuals with higher healthcare costs, and premiums rose.\nObamacare premiums in general will rise about 30% for next year; with the expiration of the enhanced subsidies, some people are going to be hit with a premium hike of 50% or more.\nDemocrats are blaming the GOP for creating a \"healthcare crisis,\" but that is dishonest. They voted for Obamacare, and they hid its true costs for years by offering ever more generous subsidies. And, they voted to allow those subsidies to expire. The cost of continuing those payments would be some $350 billion over 10 years, not including interest payments; the Trump administration wants to find a better path forward.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nFew Republicans want to tackle overhauling Obamacare, or our convoluted healthcare system, as both have proven in the past to be \"third-rail\" political issues. President Trump has proposed giving the billions of dollars that fund Affordable Care Acttax creditsdirectly to Americans instead, rather than funneling those monies through insurers. That would presumably give consumers greater choice and better control of their healthcare dollars.\nThat seems a promising approach but, really, it\u2019s just the tip of the Obamacare iceberg.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/shutdown-ends-furious-democrats-eat-own"}

Inside the H-1B visa controversy", "date": "2025-11-10", "body": "Fox News Digital spoke to Skillstorm CEO Justin Vianello about how the visa program needs to be fixed to give American workers more opportunity.\nFollowing months of controversy, PresidentDonald Trumpissued a proclamation in September decrying the systemic abuse of the H-1B visa program, which he said is fueling the \"large-scale replacement of American workers\" that \"has undermined both our economic and national security.\"\nTo address this, Trump instituted a $100,000 fee for companies seeking to obtain an H-1B visa, a move that has been widely criticized by business leaders, especially in thetech industry.\nDebate over the program has split both the American public and the GOP, with one side saying the visa holders are poaching American jobs and the other saying it is vital to U.S. competitiveness.\nSo, what areH-1B visas, and why have they become a political flashpoint?\nTRUMP ADMIN REVEALS OVER 100 INVESTIGATIONS INTO H-1B ABUSES AS IT PLEDGES 'EVERY RESOURCE' TO PROTECT US JOBS\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Sept. 19, 2025.(Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Bloomberg/Getty Images)\nAn H-1B visa is a non-immigrant work visa that allows companies in the U.S. to hire highly-skilled foreign workers in specialty occupations for an initial period of three years, which can be extended to six years.\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website states that the visas are meant for individuals of \"exceptional merit and ability.\" Individuals must have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in a relevant field.\nBy far the industry most heavily utilizing H-1B visas is the tech industry, which accounts for roughly 60% to 70% of all the new applications in recent years.\nOther top industries include consulting and professional services, engineering and manufacturing, healthcare and medical research and higher education.\nDESANTIS SAYS HE WON\u2019T TOLERATE H-1B VISA \u2018ABUSE' IN FLORIDA UNIVERSITIES\nThe U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C.(Getty)\nThere is no official figure for the number of people currently holding H-1B visas.\nThere is a yearly cap of 65,000 people who can obtain H-1B visas. The program allows for an additional 20,000 individuals holding master\u2019s degrees or above. Notably, most universities and non-profit research organizations are cap-exempt, further increasing the number of people being approved each year.\nThe Pew Research Center estimated that about 400,000 H-1B visa applications were approved last year under the Biden administration.\nNearly 3 out of every 4, 73%, of H-1B visa holders comefrom India, according to Pew. The country with the second-highest number of visa holders is China, with 12%. The remaining 15% comes from a mix of other countries, with no single country reaching the 2% threshold.\nThe H-1B visa program has been criticized on both sides of the political aisle, including from Trump to Sen.Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\nTRUMP\u2019S $100K H-1B VISA OVERHAUL COULD HIT TECH GIANTS LIKE AMAZON AND MICROSOFT HARDEST\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.(Joe Maher)\nCritics say the current program has veered away from its original intent to attract top talent to work in the U.S. and instead is being used by employers to import cheap foreign labor, depress wages, and cut out American workers.\nSenate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Senate Judiciary Chair Sen.Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, reintroduced bipartisan legislation in September to reform and close loopholes in the H-1B program to protect American workers and stop the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries.\nOn the state level, Florida Republican Gov.Ron DeSantisissued guidance in October to combat the university loophole. DeSantis directed the Florida Board of Governors to end the practice of higher education institutions \"importing foreign workers on H-1B visas instead of hiring Americans\" by requiring universities to \"put American graduates first and ensure taxpayer-funded schools serve the American workforce.\"\nOn the other side of the debate, prominent figures such asElon Muskhave advocated for H-1B visas because the program is essential for the U.S. to maintain its competitive edge.\nShortly before Trump returned to the Oval Office, Musk said, \"The reason I\u2019m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B\" and pledged to \"go to war\" in support of the program.\nHowever, Musk also noted his belief that \"the program is broken and needs major reform.\"\nDOJ CALLS FOR TIPS ON EMPLOYERS FAVORING FOREIGN WORKERS IN HIRING PRACTICES\nElon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump meets South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.(Evan Vucci/AP Photo)\nHe proposed \"raising the minimum salary significantly and adding a yearly cost for maintaining the H1B, making it materially more expensive to hire from overseas than domestically.\"\nBusiness leaders have said the H-1B program is important in competing with countries such as China, which just recently launched a similar program, called the K-visa, to attract top talent to the country. The program went into effect on Oct. 1.\nThe H-1B program also has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\nOn Sept. 19, Trump issued a presidential proclamation titled \"Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,\" in which he said the H-1B visa program was being \"deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\"\nTrump said this abuse has been used by companies to \"artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.\"\nThe president wrote that \"the large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security.\"\nTRUMP ADMIN REVEALS OVER 100 INVESTIGATIONS INTO H-1B ABUSES AS IT PLEDGES 'EVERY RESOURCE' TO PROTECT US JOBS\nGov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025, said, \"We will not tolerate H-1B abuse in Florida institutions.\"(GovRonDeSantis/X.com)\nAs such, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee, effective Sept. 21, 2025. The restriction will expire one year from the effective date.\nTrump also directed his administration to \"initiate a rulemaking to prioritize the admission as nonimmigrants of high-skilled and high-paid aliens.\"\nMeanwhile, another DHS rule will narrow the definition of \"specialty occupation\" that will allow the department officials to increase worksite compliance inspections before and after an H-1B petition, and require the petitioner\u2019s employer to make the application directly \u2014 a move to stop companies from bringing in H-1B immigrants and then contracting them to other companies.\nThe debate over H-1B visas promises to continue in the coming months and years.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sued the Trump administration to stop its implementation of the $100,000 application requirement, which it says would \"make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program.\"\nThe lawsuit argues that the new fee is unlawful because it overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that govern the H-1B program, including a requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe chamber previously warned that restrictions on the H-1B program \"have the potential to inflict serious harm upon many American companies.\"\nThe case is currently ongoing. It remains to be seen whetherCongress will ultimatelyweigh in one way or another on the issue.\nPeter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/american-workers-being-replaced-inside-h-1b-visa-controversy"}

{"title": "It\u2019s not just the economy \u2014 this is how Democrats beat the GOP across the country", "date": "2025-11-10", "body": "Campus Reform reporter Emily Sturge joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss President Donald Trump's warning, why young voters supported Zohran Mamdani in the election and more.\nThe ballots are counted, the pundits are spinning, and theverdict is in: affordability isn\u2019t just an issue \u2014 it\u2019s the issue. Democrats understood that and they won. Big. Republicans, meanwhile, are facing challenges that look strikingly similar to those that cost Democrats so dearly just two years ago.\nTax cuts for the rich vs. affordability for all\nDemocrats didn\u2019t win because they suddenly became masterful campaigners, or because their candidates were flawless. They won because they focused on what\u2019s keeping Americans up at night\u2014 rising prices, shrinking paychecks and the anxiety that the American Dream is slipping further away. They promised to cap drug prices, rein in healthcare costs and make life a little less punishing for the middle class.\nAnd crucially, Democratsran unapologeticallyon taxing the rich \u2014 a message that resonated far beyond their base. For years, Republicans have viewed calls to raise taxes on the wealthy as an attack on success, a threat to the American ethos of upward mobility. But for many Americans, and for Democrats this cycle, it was about fairness. If you\u2019re rich, you can afford to pay more. After all, the rich aren\u2019t struggling \u2014 everyone else is. That sense of basic justice, not class warfare, is what made the message so powerful and popular.\nMARK PENN: DEMOCRATS WIN THE MOMENT, BUT LEFT-WING TILT THREATENS THEIR FUTURE\nRepublicans, by contrast, leaned onfamiliar themes: tax cuts, deregulation and the promise that economic growth would lift all boats. But, this time, voters seemed to want something more immediate and tangible. In poll after poll, affordability dwarfed every other concern. Democrats beat Republicans by eight points on who could best handle the cost of living. When one party is talking about your grocery bill and the other is defending capital gains, the outcome isn\u2019t a mystery.\nNot just \"The Economy, Stupid\" \u2014 it\u2019s affordability\nThere\u2019s a twist inthis year\u2019s resultsthat\u2019s easy to miss, but crucial to understand: while Republicans still hold an edge when voters are asked who\u2019s better for \"the economy\" in general, Democrats won on the issue that mattered most \u2014 affordability.\nPolls show that Americans continue to trust Republicans more on broad economic stewardship. But, when it comes to the day-to-day reality of paying for groceries, rent, healthcare and gas, Democrats pulled ahead. In a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, cost-of-living concerns topped the list of voter priorities, and Democrats were favored on the specific question of who can make life more affordable.\nThis isn\u2019t just about GDP or stock market numbers. It\u2019s about the price of eggs, the cost of a doctor\u2019s visit and whether families feel they can get ahead. Voters weren\u2019t just asking, \"Who can grow the economy?\" They were asking, \"Who can make my paycheck go further?\"\nThe lesson: It\u2019s not just \"the economy, stupid.\" It\u2019s that things cost too much, and most people feel like they\u2019re running in place. Theparty that understands\u2014 and addresses \u2014 that reality is the one that wins.\nThe GOP\u2019s Familiar Challenge\nAfter the election, President Trump sat down with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier and admitted, \"We learned a lot.\" But in the same breath, he suggested that things aren\u2019t so bad after all. \"The country is doing very well,\" he said, pointing to falling energy prices and predicting a return to $2 gasoline. The message was: we\u2019ve done this before, and we can do it again.\nYet, for many voters, the reassurance didn\u2019t quite land. The gap between political optimism and everyday reality was hard to ignore. While Republicans highlighted their record and warned about the dangers of socialism, those arguments were sometimes overshadowed by internal divisions \u2014 most notably, a rising tide of antisemitism that\u2019s fracturing the party and distracting from the issues that matter most.\nIf this all feels familiar, it should.\n2024 in reverse\nThis is 2024 in reverse. Back then, Democrats tried to reassure voters that the economy wasn\u2019t as bad as it felt, even as Americans struggled with rising costs. The left was busy debating \"wokeism,\" alienating moderates and driving away the very voters it needed most.\nNow, it\u2019s the GOP\u2019s turn to face a similar crossroads: emphasizing past achievements and ideological battles, while voters are looking for immediate relief. Democrats, having learned from their own missteps, are laser-focused on affordability \u2014 and it\u2019s paying off.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe cycle continues\nHere\u2019s the lesson, as old as politics itself: Ignore the kitchen table, and you lose the house. When a party becomes more invested in defending its own narrative than in addressing real pain, it risks losing trust \u2014 and elections.\nIf Republicans want to avoid thefate that befell Democrats, they may need to shift from reassurance to action. Voters want to know not just that things can get better, but how \u2014 and when. Because here\u2019s the twist: the party that owns affordability owns the future.\nThe closing thought\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nSo, as the dust settles, ask yourself: When was the last time a voter changed their mind because a politician told them their problems weren\u2019t real? When was the last time a party won by focusing on yesterday\u2019s debates instead of today\u2019s bills?\nThe answer is rarely, if ever. And if that feels like a revelation, maybe it\u2019s time for both parties to stop telling Americans what to think \u2014 and start listening to what they\u2019re saying.\nLee Hartley Carter is president of Maslansky + Partners, a language strategist, researcher and author of \"Persuasion: Convincing Others When Facts Don't Seem to Matter\" (TarcherPerigee, September 3, 2019).\u00a0Follow her on X on@lh_carter.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/its-not-just-economy-how-democrats-beat-gop-across-country"}

That same budget bill would have also allocated millions for volunteer fire departments, senior centers, emergency medical services,teacher bonusesand other public safety funding.\nTRUMP LOOMS LARGE OVER SPECIAL ELECTION PRIMARY IN DEEP RED CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT\nDemocrat Aftyn Behn, a Tennessee state representative, is running to take over Republican Mark Green's old seat after his retirement.(Aftyn For Congress)\n\"A pissed-off social worker, Aftyn has seen firsthand how broken systems fail the very people they\u2019re meant to protect,\" Behn's campaign website states. \"She\u2019s now running for Congress after the so-called \u2018Big, Beautiful Bill\u2019 passed \u2014 a giveaway to the wealthy that codified the largest transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in American history.\"\nHowever, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation, if Trump's 2017 tax cuts had expired, residents inTennessee's 7th Congressional District,whom Behn wants to represent, would have seen an increase in their taxes of approximately $3,717 per taxpayer.\n\"To win, Democrats need to focus on what really matters \u2014 making life more affordable for working people,\" Behn said after the bill's passage. \"Washington Republicans did the opposite by passing this #BigBullsh--Bill. Gutting healthcare and giving handouts to billionaires.\"\nTENNESSEE SUED OVER LIMITED ACCESS TO EXECUTIONS AS MEDIA DEMAND TRANSPARENCY\nEven The New York Times has admitted that independent analyses showed Trump's 2017 tax cuts \"have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law.\"\nAt left, Democratic House candidate Aftyn Behn speaks to a crowd in Dickson County, Tenn.. At right, she protests in 2021 in Nashville, demanding lawmakers pass legislation focused on climate change, infrastructure and jobs.(Aftyn For Congress; Jason Davis/Getty Images)\nLast year, Behn also voted against a bill that the Tennessee General Assembly Fiscal Review Committee estimated would provide over $1.5 billion in tax refunds for small business owners in the state. It also would have reduced a combined yearly tax burden for Tennessee business owners of about $400 million.\nSimultaneously, Behn voted against Tennessee's 2025-2026 fiscal year budget that included a big increase to the state's rainy day fund, which is used by state governments during periods of low revenue. The same budget bill also included community funding for services like volunteer fire departments, emergency medical services and rescue squads, senior centers, teacher bonuses, school security and more.\nDuring Behn's time in the state legislature, she also worked to repeal the grocery tax in Tennessee, claiming it would put money back into the pockets of hard-working Tennesseans year round. However, according to Republicans, the move would create a business enterprise tax,raising taxeson small businesses by about $800 million.\nThe Tennessee State Capitol(Joe Sohm/Visions of America/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital reached out repeatedly to Behn's campaign for comment but did not hear back.\n\"Aftyn Behn\u2019s policies would skyrocket the cost of living even more for hardworking Tennesseans,\" Behn's Republican opponent, Trump-backedMatt Van Epps,said. \"Aftyn has repeatedly voted against tax cuts and proposed new taxes, taking more money from your pocket. I\u2019ll always fight to lower taxes and bring down costs so that working families can get ahead.\"\nInlocal media reports,Behn has been compared to Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect and self-proclaimed socialist, and the Dickson County Democratic Party described Behn as \"our very own AOC of TN,\" a reference to U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\"His message is one of helping working families across New York.

{"title": "Trump\u2019s own SCOTUS picks could wind up hurting him on tariffs", "date": "2025-11-08", "body": "Legal fellow Brent Skorup says the president\u2019s use of emergency tariffs goes beyond what IEEPA allows in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case centered on PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s use of an emergency law to enact his sweeping \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, and even Trump-appointed justices appeared skeptical of the administration\u2019s arguments.\nSeveral questions from conservative justices, particularly Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, suggested uncertainty about allowing Trump to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact his steep 10% tariffs on most imports. A ruling against the administration would deliver a major blow to Trump's signature economic policy.\nThe IEEPA law gives the president broad economic powers in the event of a national emergency tied to foreign threats, and Trump declared the trade deficit such an emergency to impose tariffs via executive order earlier this year. But the law does not mention the word \"tariffs\" or \"taxes\" \u2014 a major sticking point in both this week\u2019s oral arguments and the lower court\u2019s earlier review of the case.\nMost of the justices\u2019 questions focused on a single phrase in the law \u2014 the power to \"regulate importation\" during a national emergency \u2014 and whether that phrase grants Trump the authority he claims. Several justices seemed wary of a reading that could hand Congress\u2019 Article I power over revenue and taxation to the executive branch.\nSUPREME COURT TO WEIGH TRUMP TARIFF POWERS IN BLOCKBUSTER CASE\nMembers of the Supreme Court sit for a group photo following the recent addition of Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, at the Supreme Court building on Capitol Hill on Friday, Oct 7, 2022, in Washington, D.C.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\nThis includedTrump\u2019s appointees, who appeared to struggle with separation-of-powers issues that could vastly expand presidential authority \u2014 not only for Trump but for his successors as well.\nBarrett, in particular, pressed U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer on this, asking: \"Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase \u2014 together with \u2018regulate importation\u2019 \u2014 has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?\"\nGorsuch later asked Sauer about his \"theory of the Constitution\" and \"major questions doctrine,\" indicating concern about separation-of-powers issues and granting too much power to the executive.\nTRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER'\nProtester Nadine Seiler, 60 (left), and plaintiff Victor Schwartz (right) in front of the Supreme Court building ahead of oral arguments regarding President Trump's legal authority to impose most of his sweeping tariffs in Washington, D.C., Wed. Nov. 5, 2025.(Maxine Wallace/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\"What would prohibit Congress from abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce or declare war to the president?\" Gorsuch asked Sauer.\nSauer repeatedly argued that a \"regulatory tariff\" is not a tax and that the power to raise revenue was \"only incidental,\" even asthe White House has celebratedthat Trump's tariff revenues exceeded $100 billion this year.\nChallengers, including private entities and Democratic-led states, argue that Congress must clearly state when it wants presidents to have the authority to implement tariffs. In court filings, they pointed to laws such as Section 232 (national security trade measures) and Section 301 (retaliation for unfair trade) as times when Congress expressly gave tariff powers to the president. By contrast, IEEPA has been used for embargoes, asset freezes and licensing but never across-the-board tariffs. The last time the Court permitted a delegation of tariff powers to the president, in Algonquin SNG v. FEA (1976), it relied on Section 232 because Congress put that authority plainly in the statute. Challengers say there is no comparable language in IEEPA.\nThe liberal justices on the Court signaled that without clear words from Congress, IEEPA cannot provide Trump with tariff authority. After a previous Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024), courts no longer give federal agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting vague laws. And under the \"major questions\" doctrine referred to by Gorsuch and other justices, large, economy-wide actions like Trump's tariffs need a plain, specific grant from Congress.\nJONATHAN TURLEY: SUPREME COURT RULING ON TRUMP TARIFFS COMES DOWN TO A NUMBERS GAME\nScott Bessent, U.S. Treasury Secretary, speaks to reporters outside the White House in Washington, D.C., on Wed, Nov. 5, 2025.(Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nCourt watchers and legal experts said after arguments that a Trump administration win could be more difficult than expected, though each cautioned it is hard to draw conclusions from roughly two hours of oral arguments \u2014 a fraction of the total time justices spend reviewing a case.\nJonathan Turley, a law professor and Fox News contributor, said in ablog postthat the justices \"were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers.\"\n\"However, there is a real chance of a fractured decision that could still produce an effective win for the administration,\" Turley added.\nSUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY\nJack Goldsmith, a former assistant attorney general in theGeorge W. Bushadministration, did not go quite as far.\n\"I think that it is fair to say that the justices the government needs to win the case \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett \u2014 asked the government very hard questions that did express skepticism about important elements of its case,\" Goldsmith said in aNew York Times interview.\n\"But they also asked the other side very hard questions. I do not think any of these three tipped off their hands definitively. I did not find anything terribly surprising in the questions.\"\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nBrent Skorup, a legal fellow at the CATO Institute, told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement that members of the Court seemed uncomfortable with expanding presidential power over tariffs.\n\"Most justices appeared attentive to the risks of deferring to a president's interpretation of an ambiguous statute and the executive branch \u2018discovering\u2019 new powers in old statutes,\" Skorup said.\n\"The justices were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers.

The White House previously told Fox News Digital that the fee works to prevent \"companies from spamming the system and driving down wages\" with cheap foreign labor, while simultaneously promoting \"American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers\" to the U.S.\nThe Department of Labor could not provide details on the specifics of the 175 current investigations, which account for over $15 million in calculated back wages to workers, but reported to Fox Digital that it has uncovered a bounty of concerns.\nThe investigations have uncovered that some foreign workers with advanced degrees are paid far less than what's promoted in a job description, which the DOL said drives down wages for visa-holders and American workers alike, while also forcing American employees with the same qualification to accept lower wages in order to stay competitive.\nOther investigations found that employers did not even notify U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services when an H-1B visa holder was terminated, or found significant lag times between a termination and an employer notifying the agency that oversees the U.S.'s immigration system.\nWALMART HALTS HIRING WORKERS WHO NEED H-1B VISAS AFTER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IMPOSES NEW FEE\nLori Chavez-DeRemer, U.S. Secretary of Labor.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nAt the heart of other investigations, Fox News Digital learned, are documents filed by employers with the DOL in order to employ H-1B holders, as well as other visa programs, called Labor Condition Applications (LCA). Employers are required to give notice to American workers before hiring H-IB workers when filing an LCA, which is part of a larger effort to ensure American workers get first dibs on jobs, as well as accurately describe the job an employee will work and detailing the employee's wage.\nInvestigators found that work sites listed on the LCA documents did not exist, or that workers were unaware of the jobs they were supposedly assigned to perform as laid out in the applications. Other investigations found that employees were paid less than what was detailed in an LCA, or that employers were sloppily copying and pasting job notices for American workers that had little connection to the job described in the LCA.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Sept. 19, 2025.(Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Bloomberg/Getty Images)\nOther investigations found some employees took part in \"benching,\" which is when H-1B visa holders are not paid anything when they are in-between active work projects, Fox Digital found.\nMany tech companies have embraced the H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, but critics of the program say H-1B holders are often chosen over U.S. citizens for jobs. One of the reasons for this is that foreign workers are tied to their respective employers via the H-1B visa \u2014 as a company is required to sponsor the visa \u2014 and therefore quitting the job could ultimately see foreign workers losing their visa and their ability to legally remain in the country.\nJustin Vianello, CEO of Skillstorm,told Fox News Digitallast month that the work visa program in the United States is a \"three-headed monster\" that needs to be drastically reformed in order to not leave American workers behind.\nEarlier this year, the Trump administrationunveiled a proposaldesigned to nudge employers toward offering higher salaries or reserving H-1B petitions for jobs that require advanced skills. The rule change, formally published in the Federal Register, came just days after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.\nThe $100,000 fee \u2014 a one-time charge applying only to new H-1B petitions \u2014 will take effect in the next annual lottery, the system the U.S. government uses to select applications once the annual visa cap is reached.\n\"The whole idea is no more will these Big Tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers.

AFL filed a complaint against Portland a few days later as well, alleging similar accusations.\nTOP UNIVERSITY HIT WITH SCATHING FEDERAL COMPLAINT CALLING FOR PROBE INTO \u2018UNSAFE\u2019 AND \u2018UNLAWFUL\u2019 DEI AGENDA\nVirginia police officers seen walking outside the state capitol building in Richmond, Virginia.(Photo by ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP via Getty Images)\n\"Despite these federal civil rights laws, these jurisdictions openly engage in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (\"DEI\") policies in their respective jurisdictions, ordering local departments to implement discriminatory \u2018equity\u2019 programs and directives,\" an AFL press release states. \"Race-based policies do not create justice\u2014they destroy it. As Virginia lurches to the Left, America First Legal will continue leading the fight to ensure that federal funds never support programs that divide citizens, weaken public safety, or erode the rule of law.\"\nIn AFL's complaint, the legal watchdog accuses the City of Richmond of creating a \"government-wide pattern or practice of discrimination\" by embedding racial equity in every department. The complaint cites hiring materials embedded with discriminatory themes, mandatory DEI training, Richmond's Equity Agenda, and the capital city's establishment of an Office of Equity and Inclusion, which AFL claims to have an aim to empower \"only certain people and communities wholly based on race,\" rather than merit.\nRichmond\u2019s fiscal year budgets reportedly measured department performance by the percentage of employees completing \"equity training,\" with a stated goal of 100% participation. Meanwhile, AFL also cited Richmond's \"Climate Equity Action Plan\" and \"Racial Equity and Environmental Justice (REEJ) program,\" which the group accuses of funneling resources to only certain racial groups.\nCONSERVATIVE MOM SUED FOR CALLING DEI TEACHER \u2018WOKE\u2019 CELEBRATES AS DEFAMATION CASE TOSSED\nThecivil rights complaintsagainst Alexandria and Arlington include similar allegations to those levied against Richmond.\nThe monument of confederate General A.P.

A similar \"strategic plan\" from the city's fire department reportedly pushes similar hiring preferences on its department as well, AFL alleges.\nA police officer blocks an intersection in Alexandria, Virginia.(Alex Wong/Getty Images)\nArlington, meanwhile, is accused of establishing an \"Affirmative Action Plan,\" which AFL says includes \"underutilization goals\" based on race for specific job groups. These goals include increasing minority representation in the \"Senior Administrators\" job group from 35.23% to 45%, and minority representation in\"Police Officers\"from 27.38% to 38%, according to AFL's complaint.\nTo prove the real-life consequences of these cities' policies, AFL's complaint against Arlington pointed to an incident at a local public school from last year.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA polling location in Arlington, Virginia.(Valerie Plesch/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\"In September 2024, a male sex offender was permitted to use the girls\u2019 locker room at Washington Liberty High School in Arlington County for months because he claimed to be transgender\u2014a direct result of the County\u2019s policy allowing individuals to use facilities based on their claimed \u2018gender identity.\u2019 The individual ultimately exposed his genitals to a 9-year-old girl,\" AFL's complaint to the Department of Justice chronicles. \"This incident demonstrates how Arlington County\u2019s race- and sex-conscious policies not only violate federal civil rights law but also compromise student safety.\"\nLast month, AFL reached a settlement with theCity of Philadelphiathat began in 2019 over alleged race- and sex-based quotas and \"discriminatory\" union-membership requirements in public contracting.

{"title": "JONATHAN TURLEY: Supreme Court ruling on Trump tariffs comes down to a numbers game", "date": "2025-11-06", "body": "U.S. Trade Representative Amb. Jamieson Greer addresses the legal uniqueness of the word \u2018tariff\u2019 on \u2018The Ingraham Angle.\u2019\nThe oral argument on Nov. 5 for theTrump tariffswas fascinating as justices struggled with the knotty question of whether a president has the sweeping authority claimed by President Donald Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The justices were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers. However, there is a real chance of a fractured decision that could still produce an effective win for the administration.\nFirst, the counsel. I was highly impressed by the performance of Solicitor General John Sauer, who did a brilliant job in weaving historical and precedential arguments in favor of the tariffs. He had a tough case and at times a tough audience, but maintained a coherent and consistent position.\nMany were surprised that the challengers selected the liberal firebrand Neil Katyal for counsel on the other side. Kavanaugh even made a quip about the incongruity of Katyal arguing for issues like non-delegation. Katyal struggled at points andJustice Amy Coney Barrettbashed him once for seemingly flipping his position in oral argument. However, Katyal made the key points against the claim of statutory and constitutional authority.\nTRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER'\nOverall, the administration faced worrisome moments in the argument, with Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly referring to tariffs as a clear \"tax\" and Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raising the \"major questions doctrine.\" Neither works well for the administration. If this is a tax, it is more likely viewed as a usurpation of Congress' inherent tax authority.\nAn exterior view of the Supreme Court on June 20, 2024, in Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court just held arguments over President Donald Trump's tariffs. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nHowever, the head counting becomes more difficult as you comb through the specific questions of the justices.\nWe begin with the clear votes in favor of the challengers by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Indeed, at times, both justices seemed to take on the role of counsel in clarifying the confusion left by the challengers and directing them back to what they viewed as more solid ground.\nSUPREME COURT TO WEIGH TRUMP TARIFF POWERS IN BLOCKBUSTER CASE\nJustice Elena Kagan, as usual, was more circumspect, but still clearly leaning against the administration.\nThat leaves two more votes to reject the tariffs.\nThe most obvious candidate would be Barrett, who hit Sauer hard with questions on the largely unprecedented scope of the Trump tariffs. Much of this turned on the meaning of the terms \"regulate importation\" in IEEPA. Barrett asked pointedly: \"Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase, together with \u2018regulate importation,\u2019 has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?\"\nSauer stressed that a predecessor law was used in this manner, but Barrett repeatedly returned and was clearly not satisfied. At one point, Sotomayor (prematurely, in my view) snapped at Sauer and said, \"just answer the justice\u2019s question.\"\nTRUMP WARNS SUPREME COURT TARIFF SHOWDOWN IS 'LIFE OR DEATH' FOR AMERICA\nNevertheless, Barrett offered the administration some hope in their questioning of the challengers.\nShe zeroed in on the fact that licenses are within the power of the president:\nUnited States Supreme Court (front row L-R) Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts, Associate Justice Samuel Alito, and Associate Justice Elena Kagan, (back row L-R) Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pose for their official portrait at the East Conference Room of the Supreme Court building on October 7, 2022, in Washington, D.C.(OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)\nJUSTICE BARRETT: \"So, this license thing is important to me. And do you agree that pursuant to IEEPA, the president could impose \u2014 could regulate commerce by imposing a license fee?\"\nKatyal seemed to struggle with this when Barrett noted that he had previously stated there is little difference between a license and a tariff. Barrett said that, if so, a president could regulate commerce in the same way with a license fee.\nSUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY\nMR. KATYAL: \"Not a fee. So, I should have said this earlier. But license is different from a licensing fee. IEEPA and TWEA authorize licenses, not license fees. And no president has ever charged, to my knowledge, fees under those two statutes for the licenses. So, fee is impermissible. License is OK.\"\nJUSTICE BARRETT: \"But I thought you conceded to Justice Gorsuch there was no difference between a tariff and a licensing fee functionally.\"\nNevertheless, Barrett offered the administration some hope in their questioning of the challengers.\nMR. KATYAL: \"Well, if the \u2014 if the licensing fee is just to \u2014 I didn't concede that.\"\nJUSTICE BARRETT: \"OK.\"\nBarrett kept telling Katyal that she was not following his arguments. Barrett also seemed intrigued by the incongruity that a president could use embargoes or quotas to effectively shut down trade entirely, so why shouldn't he be allowed to use the lesser of the powers?\nThe fifth vote could come from Gorsuch, but again, the rationales were strikingly different from those of the other justices.\nGorsuch clearly viewed the delegation of the authority as problematic and also raised the \"major questions doctrine.\" However, he was also the most effective in hammering Katyal on plain meaning arguments, noting the verb \"regulate\" is \"capacious.\"\nIf Gorsuch were to argue that the delegation is unconstitutional, he may find himself in the minority, but could then give the president the statutory argument on the broad implications of \"regulate importation.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh was the most useful for the administration in returning to the history ofPresident Richard Nixon's global 10% tariff, under the Trading with the Enemy Act, the predecessor of IEEPA.\nOverall, the administration faced worrisome moments in the argument, with Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly referring to tariffs as a clear \"tax\" and Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raising the \"major questions doctrine.\"\nHe also highlighted how, in FEA v. Algonquin SNG (1976), the court allowed the exercise of tariff powers. At one point, he slammed Katyal's effort to rewrite the decision and said, \"Algonquin didn't have anything like that, but keep going.\"\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nThere is a chance that the challengers could eke out a majority with Barrett and possibly another conservative, such as Gorsuch or Roberts. However, it is also possible that, when the justices delve into the details, they may find a fragmented rationale that ultimately works to the advantage of the administration.\nIn the meantime,Congress may want to get startedin addressing what Barrett described as \"the mess\" of reimbursement if the tariffs were found to be unlawful.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEY\nJonathan Turley is a Fox News Media contributor and the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.\u00a0He is the author of \"The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage\" (Simon & Schuster, June 18, 2024).", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jonathan-turley-supreme-court-ruling-trump-tariffs-comes-down-numbers-game"}

Trump said at the time that trade deficits amounted to \"the precipice of an economic and national-security crisis\" sufficient to trigger his powers under IEEPA.\nJustices focused very little of their questions Wednesday on the economic impacts of Trump\u2019s tariff plans. Rather, the majority of the time during oral arguments centered on the IEEPA statute at the heart of the case, its applicability to tariffs or taxation powers \u2014 and what guardrails, if any, exist to limit the whims of an executive, should the high court rule in Trump\u2019s favor. The law in question authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" during a declared national emergency, but it does not mention the word \"tariffs.\"\nIn arguments, the administration told justices that IEEPA's allows a president to \"regulate\" \"importation\" of goods, which they said is the practical equivalent of a \"tariff.\"\nTRUMP TARIFF PLAN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS COURT BATTLES INTENSIFY\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on April 3, 2025, in Washington, D.C., shortly after announcing sweeping new tariffs.(Getty Images)\nBut several conservative justices questioned that, saying a tariff amounted to a tax on consumers.\n\"Is the constitutional assignment of the taxing power to Congress, the power to reach into the pockets of the American people, just different?\" Justice Neil Gorsuch asked, referring back to the founding of the country.\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett followed up, asking if there has \"ever been another instance in which a statute has used that language to confer the power\" that Trump seeks.\nOther conservative justices questioned whether an \"economic equivalent\" to tariffs could be used by the president under the law, such as sanctions, embargos, licenses, and quotas.\nThe two consolidated cases, Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, mark the first time during Trump's second term that the Supreme Court will review his policies fully on its merits, rather than through the so-called shadow docket, where justices have often sided with the administration in granting temporary stays and other emergency actions.\nUnlike other cases, this one also centers on an issue Trump considers to be the signature economic policy of his second term.\n\"Tomorrow\u2019s United StatesSupreme Courtcase is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our country,\" Trump said in a post on social media Tuesday night, adding that, without it, the U.S. is \"virtually defenseless against other countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us.\"\nLawyers for the Trump administration have argued in lower courts that the IEEPA allows a president to act in response to \"unusual and extraordinary threats\" and in cases where a national emergency has been declared. Trump has claimed that deep and \"sustained\" trade deficits amount to a national emergency that allows him to invoke IEEPA.\nPlaintiffs counter that in the 50 years since its passage, the law has never been used by a president to impose tariffs and that permitting the president to do so would drastically expand his powers at the expense of other branches of government. They contended to lower courts that Trump\u2019s use of IEEPA to address the trade deficit is unlawful, pointing out that, by the administration\u2019s own admission, the trade deficit has persisted for nearly 50 years, which they say undermines any claim of an \"unusual and extraordinary\" emergency.\nUS COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE SIDES WITH TRUMP IN TARIFF CASE\nSupreme Court justices attend President Trump's inaugural ceremony on January 20, 2025, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.(Ricky Carioti /The Washington Post via Getty Images)\nJustices on Wednesday immediately jumped into what's known as the \"major question doctrine.\" Plaintiffs in the case have repeatedly argued that Trump\u2019s use of IEEPA violates the doctrine \u2014 which requires Congress to be explicit when it hands the executive branch powers to make decisions with a vast economic or political significance.\n\"Congress does not (and could not) use such vague terminology to grant the executive virtually unconstrained taxing power of such staggering economic effect \u2014 literally trillions of dollars \u2014 shouldered by American businesses and consumers,\" they told the court in an earlier briefing.\nU.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer acknowledged to the justices that IEEPA does not explicitly give an executive the power to regulate tariffs, though he argued that the power to tariff is \"the natural common sense inference\" of the 1977 law.\nJustices pressed Sauer as to why Trump invoked IEEPA to impose his sweeping tariffs, noting that doing so would be the first time a president used the law to set import taxes on trading partners.\nBarrett grilled Sauer at length on this issue, asking if he could point to \"any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase together \u2014 'regulate importation' \u2014 has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority.\"\nThey also noted that, unlike other statutes that delegate tariff authority to the president, IEEPA does not mention the word tariff, and some of the justices seemed skeptical of the administration's assertion that they do not need additional permission from Congress to use the law in such a sweeping manner.\nTRUMP WARNS SUPREME COURT TARIFF SHOWDOWN IS \u2018LIFE OR DEATH\u2019 FOR AMERICA\nJustice Elena Kagan pressed Sauer on the Trump administration's contention that IEEPA is only narrowly reviewable by the courts.\n\"We agree that it's a major power, but it's in the context of a statute that is explicitly conferring major powers,\" Sauer said. \"That the point of the statute is to confer major powers to address major questions \u2014 which are emergencies.\"\n\"So it would be unusual to say, look at the statute, say we're not going to find a major power. Well, but the exercise of the power is to impose tariffs. \"\nThat prompted a follow-up question from Gorsuch, who asked, \"Could Congress delegate to the president the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations as he sees fit and collect duties as he sees fit?\"\nGorsuch appeared skeptical of the administration's use of IEEPA, which would essentially cut out congressional oversight on the tariffs enacted under the law, and limit judicial review.\nBarrett and Gorsuch used their time to ask about the balance of powers, and how Congress could ever get the tariff delegation back if it was allocated to Trump under IEEPA.\nBoth justices posed a string of pointed questions to Sauer on the broad latitude that would be granted to Trump under the law, and their skepticism could prove telling in how the court eventually decides the case.\nIt's unclear how the court might rule on the matter, though Trump's laser-focus on the case was on sharp display, including with the attendance of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nA Fox News graphic that depicts how countries have responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs.(Fox News / MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)\nNeal Katyal, who helped argue the case on behalf of the plaintiffs, told justices Wednesday that Trump has \"torn up the entire tariff architecture.\"\nChief Justice John Roberts pressed Katyal on the foreign policy issues at play, noting that, unlike taxes, tariffs deal explicitly with foreign powers \u2014 which could give the president more latitude to act.\n\"It implicates, very directly, the president\u2019s foreign affairs power,\" Roberts noted at one point during the exchange.\nJudges for lower appeals courts previously pressed lawyers for the administration to explain why Trump invoked IEEPA when there are other, more narrow statutes enacted by Congress to specifically deal with tariffs. These laws include certain caps on tariff amounts, as well as timeframes reviewable by Congress. IEEPA, however, does not mention the word tariffs at all.\nBarrett and other justices nodded to this Wednesday in their own questions.\n\"Here, you\u2019re talking about something that is exclusively committed to Congress in Article One,\" Katyal said. \"When you have delegations, I would say \u2014 even when you have delegations in some military cases and emergency statutes \u2014 they have all sorts of limits.\"\nLower courts sided with plaintiffs from Democratic states and a coalition of small businesses against Trump, with a three-judge panel for the Court of International Trade ruling this summer that Trump's authorities under IEEPA are not \"unbounded.\"\nAppealing to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department has argued that \"denial of tariff authority would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses.\"\nSauer said in an earlier court filing thatnullifying the tariffswould have \"catastrophic consequences\" for national security and global supply chains.\nThe original lawsuits were brought in part by two related third-generation family-owned businesses who make \"hands-on educational toys and products for children,\" according to legal briefs filed by Learning Resources and hand2mind's, whose lawsuit was one of two consolidated cases reviewed by the high court.\nTheir products are developed and manufactured partly in the U.S. About 60% of the assembly is outsourced overseas to several Asian countries, including China and Thailand.\nRick Woldenberg, CEO of the two Chicago-area companies founded by his grandfather more than a century ago, said that a Supreme Court ruling for the Trump administration could put him out of business, and predicted that the tariffs would increase from $2.3 million in 2024 to $100.2 million this year.\n\"I wish I had $100 million,\" he told Fox News in an interview. \"Honest to God, no exaggeration: It feels like the end of days.\"\nWoldenberg said Trump's call to return manufacturing back to the U.S. is not practical, at least for his small businesses.\n\"I have been looking for American manufacturers for a long time,\" he said, \"and I have come up with zero companies to partner with.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nExperts say the impact of this case could stretch far beyond tariffs. A ruling in Trump's favor could cement a broad precedent for future administrations, which could then invoke national emergencies as a pretext to act without congressional review on a wide range of issues.\nUltimately, \"this is a separation of powers issue,\" Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel for the Liberty Justice Center and counsel for plaintiffs in one of the consolidated cases, told Fox News Digital in an interview.\n\"It's not about this president,\" he said, speaking on the eve of the oral arguments. \"It's about all presidents and the power that they have under the Constitution, and the powers that they don't have under the Constitution, and whether Congress can delegate those powers \u2014 and, if it does, how broad can those powers be?\"\n\"Everybody should be concerned about that,\" he said. \"Because even if you like what the president is doing now, you might not like what a future president does with the same power.\"\nBreanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering theTrump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI and other national news.

They are considered guilty of neglecting the vulnerable in their policies and corruption in their dealings.\nDemocrats benefit from the opposite: bias by omission. Back in 1992, CBS reporter Betsy Aaron warned: \"The largest opinion is what we leave out. I mean, it sounds simplistic, but I always say worry about what you're not seeing. What you are seeing you can really criticize, because you're smart and you have opinions. But if we don't tell you anything, and we leave whole areas uncovered, that's the danger.\"\nWatching the broadcast network \"news\" programs this week was often an exercise in noting what they left out. Here are just four examples.\n1. The FBI reported that a 29-year-old Minnesota man, Tyler Maxon Avalos, now faces one federal charge for transmitting a TikTok post that read, in part: \"Wanted.Pam Bondi, preferably dead,\" and referred to a reward of $45,000. A threat about murdering the attorney general of the United States drew a story Monday on \"NBC Nightly News,\" but ABC, CBS and PBS couldn\u2019t be bothered.\nPresident Donald Trump (R) walks with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi (L) during a visit to the Justice Department Mar. 14, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nBROADCAST BIAS: ON UPSIDE-DOWN TV NETWORKS, ICE AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE THE DANGEROUS LAW-BREAKERS\nThis omission was especially galling on NPR, which often acted as an eager publicity arm for former PresidentJoe Biden\u2019s Attorney General Merrick Garland. This week, Justice Department correspondent Ryan Lucas appeared all over the network to warn about the dangers of President Trump designating Antifa as a domestic terrorism group. NPR is much more concerned about the work of Antifa than the life of Pam Bondi.\n2. The American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley issued a statement to NBC News on Monday saying, \"It's time to pass aclean continuing resolutionand end the shutdown today, no half-measures and no gamesmanship.\" That was aimed at Democrats, since Republicans have constantly pushed a clean resolution. NBC reported it online, but it didn\u2019t make the nightly newscast. ABC and CBS skipped it that night. PBS gave it 18 seconds.\n3. On Tuesday, Oct. 28, theRepublican-led House Oversight Committee released its reporton the Biden White House staff covering up Biden's mental decline. Chairman James Comer, R-Ky. summarized: \"The Biden Autopen Presidency will go down as one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. As Americans saw President Biden\u2019s decline with their own eyes, Biden\u2019s inner circle sought to deceive the public, cover-up his decline, and took unauthorized executive actions with the autopen that are now invalid.\"\nTRUMP HITS ABC, NBC AS \u2018FAKE NEWS,\u2019 SAYS HE\u2019D SUPPORT FCC REVOKING LICENSES\nABC, CBS and NBC aired nothing. PBS offered a dismissive brief. NPR's \"All Things Considered\" performed an interview, but all it \"considered\" was whether Biden's autopen pardons could be reversed. All the committee's findings, videos and transcripts of powerful Biden White House officials were not explained.\n4. On Wednesday, Oct. 29, Iowa Republican Sen.Chuck Grassleyreleased documents detailing \"Arctic Frost,\" an operation where Biden-appointed special counsel Jack Smith went absolutely overboard in issuing subpoenas to investigate Biden\u2019s political opponents, in the guise of a January 6 probe.

They had time for stories on a dog falling down a cliff and a monkey getting loose in a toy store, but not Democrats behaving badly.\nWhen Republican committees conduct investigations, it\u2019s simply not newsworthy.

Both sides have urged a quick decision, since the U.S. has been engaged in active,ongoing trade negotiationswith dozens of countries over the past months.\nThis could be the start of several high-profile merits appeals over Trump's executive actions.\nIn December, the justices will decide whether to overturn a 90-year precedent dealing with the president's ability to fire members of some federal regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission.\nSENATE REPUBLICANS DEFECT, REJECT TRUMP'S TARIFFS ON CANADIAN GOODS\nAnd in January, the power of President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors will be tested in another major constitutional showdown. For now, the Biden-appointed Cook will remain on the job.\nOther appeals that could be added to the high court argument docket include birthright citizenship and otherimmigration-related petitions, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies in educational institutions and the environment.\nCongress is given the power under the Constitution's Article I to \"lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.\"\nBut when Trump in February began issuing a series of executive orders, he relied on the IEEPA, which gives the president the power \u2014 under a self-declared national economic emergency \u2014 to \"investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.\"\nTheTrump Justice Departmentsays the choices are stark.\n\"President Trump and his advisors have determined that erroneously invalidating the IEEPA tariffs, 'would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy,'\" wrote U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who will argue the case before the justices. Citing Trump's own words, \"The President has emphasized: 'If the United States were forced to unwind these historic agreements ... the economic consequences would be ruinous, instead of unprecedented success.\"\nPresident Donald Trump meets with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025, in Washington.(Alex Brandon/AP Photo)\nBut the plaintiffs claim no president until now in the law's five decades has ever used it to impose \"sweeping worldwide\" tariffs.\n\"Context, history and common sense all support a more modest understanding of that provision \u2014 one that leaves the President ample tools to address emergencies but does not delegate Congress' tariffing power wholesale,\" wrote Benjamin Gutman, Oregon's solicitor general, who will argue the case for the state plaintiffs. \"This Court should reject the President\u2019s bid to seize that power for himself.\"\nTwo categories of tariffs involving a variety of products are being contested: The first are \"trafficking tariffs,\" on goods fromCanada, China and Mexico, imposed after the Trump administration said those nations have not done enough to reduce the flow of fentanyl.\nThe second, broader category, labeled \"reciprocal tariffs,\" involves tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on products from virtually all countries.\nThe Supreme Court will hold at least 80-minutes of scheduled oral arguments in its marble-lined courtroom, but the public session is expected to last much longer.\nThe justices will almost certainly have many questions of counsel from both sides, since they will be confronting a range of novel legal and constitutional questions over Trump's tariff authority.\nTRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER'\nThe arguments \u2014 audio of which will be streamed live on the court's website \u2014 will consist of the bench posing questions, comments and hypotheticals to lawyers from thefederal government, private business and the states.\nAfter the public sessions, the justices will meet privately \u2014 perhaps later Wednesday \u2014 and vote on the case, at least preliminarily.\nThe majority and any dissenting opinions will be assigned, and the court go begin articulating a ruling that will serve as precedent for this and future disputes over executive authority.\nThe court will have no shortage of information to ponder. In addition to the written briefs filed by the opposing parties, about four dozen \"amicus\" briefs have been filed, offering a range of legal positions from advocacy groups, other state governments and legal and economic scholars.\nUnited States Supreme Court (front row L-R) Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts, Associate Justice Samuel Alito, and Associate Justice Elena Kagan, (back row L-R) Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pose for their official portrait at the East Conference Room of the Supreme Court building on Oct. 7, 2022, in Washington, D.C.(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\nThe unpredictable, ongoing rollout of tariffs has createdglobal economic uncertaintyand fears of higher consumer prices, but Trump has also used them as political leverage to pressure countries into negotiating new trade deals.\n\"A big fraction of the Supreme Court's docket will present the question, can President Trump do: fill in the blank? And that includes imposed tariffs,\" said Dupree. \"Trump is pushing at every limit and the Supreme Court this term is going to be telling us whether he's exceeded those limits.

This year\u2019s favorite epithet is \"socialist.\"\nRep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Sen.Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and New York City mayoral hopefulZohran Mamdanihave each been branded with it, often before they finish a sentence. \u00a0To their critics, the word evokes Venezuela or the Soviet Union. To their supporters, it means fairness, dignity or simply a system that finally works for ordinary people.\nBut when we label something an\u00a0-ism, we often fail to see what\u2019s actually resonating. Because underneath the slogans and self-descriptions, the other side is winning on the issues that matter most to people\u2019s daily lives:\u00a0the economy, fairness, opportunity, affordability.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pose for a photo in Astoria, Queens, Sept. 6, 2025. (@ZohranKMamdani via X)\nThe echo chamber of righteousness\nIt\u2019s tempting to believe thatcalling someone a \"socialist\"\u2014 or a \"fascist,\" or a \"communist\" \u2014 delivers moral precision. It doesn\u2019t. It delivers applause.\nHOW THE LEFT'S EMBRACE OF MAMDANI COULD DOOM DEMOCRATS NATIONWIDE\nIn 1964, Democrats called Barry Goldwater a fascist. He lost, but mostly because he frightened moderates with talk of nuclear war \u2014 not because the label landed. What\u00a0did\u00a0land was the\u00a0\"Daisy\" ad, a 60-second spot that aired once and changed politics forever.\nA little girl plucks petals from a flower as her voice fades into a missile countdown. Then comes a nuclear explosion and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s voice:\u00a0\"These are the stakes: to make a world in which all of God\u2019s children can live, or to go into the dark.\"\u00a0That ad didn\u2019t call Goldwater names; it made voters\u00a0feel\u00a0the stakes. It worked because it tied fear to a credible consequence, not an ideology.\nEver since,politicians have tried to recreatethat emotional impact \u2014 often forgetting that fear persuades only when it feels believable. Decades later, Republicans warned Barack Obama was a socialist. He won twice. In 2016 and 2024, Democrats branded Donald Trump a fascist. He still won. The pattern is clear: moral name-calling doesn\u2019t persuade. It polarizes. It makes us feel righteous but sound out of touch.\nThe illusion of moral clarity\nWhen everything becomes an\u00a0-ism, we stop listening for the \"why.\" AOC talks about workingfamilies crushed by rent and debt. Bernie talks about dignity in work. Mamdani talks about a city that feels rigged against the middle.\n5 THINGS NEW YORK REPUBLICANS NEED TO HEAR FROM ANDREW CUOMO\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with their solutions to understand why that message lands. Labeling them \"socialist\" doesn\u2019t answer their critique \u2014 it avoids it. And while we argue over ideology, voters are hearing something simpler and more emotional:\u00a0someone sees me. That\u2019s why these movements gain traction \u2014 not because people are clamoring for socialism, but because they\u2019re desperate for fairness.\nThe right response isn\u2019t a label \u2014 it\u2019s a vision\nInstead of calling Mamdani a communist, the right might try saying: We agree \u2014 New York should still be the city where anything can happen, where dreams come true and anyone can get ahead. But the answer isn\u2019t handouts or punishing success. It\u2019s\u00a0creating more opportunity for everyone.That\u2019s the message that connects. It\u2019s aspirational, not accusatory.\nImagine if conservatives said:\u00a0Here are three things we\u2019d do instead.\nThat\u2019s not socialism. It\u2019s shared success. And it reframes the conversation from fear to possibility.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nWhen words lose meaning, trust follows\nWe throw ideological grenades \u2014 \"socialist,\" \"fascist,\" \"extremist,\" \"woke\" \u2014 the way we once tossed adjectives. The result is exhaustion. When everything\u2019s a five-alarm fire, voters stop evacuating the building. The danger isn\u2019t just polarization; it\u2019s\u00a0meaning collapse.\u00a0When language becomes theater, politics becomes parody. Outrage turns into a drug. Empathy becomes a weakness.\nThe working class isn\u2019t asking for -isms\nSpend time in diners, union halls and church basements, and you won\u2019t hear ideological language. You\u2019ll heareconomic anxiety. Parents wondering if their kids can afford to live where they grew up. Workers asking why two jobs still don\u2019t cover rent. They\u2019re not asking for capitalism or socialism. They\u2019re asking for fairness \u2014 a shot at stability and dignity. When politicians argue about -isms instead of ideas, they sound detached from real life.\nThe politics of normalcy\nThe leaders who have endured \u2014 Reagan, Clinton, Obama in his best moments \u2014 didn\u2019t win by labeling their opponents. They won by\u00a0reassuring voters\u00a0that their own vision was steady, sane and hopeful.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nReagan didn\u2019t demonize liberalism; he reframed it. He made it about consequences \u2014higher taxes, slower growth, less freedom. That\u2019s what effective communicators do: they translate ideology into impact. That\u2019s what the right could do now \u2014 not rail against socialism, but reassert the American idea that fairness comes from\u00a0opportunity, not resentment.\nThe bottom line\nIf everything you oppose becomes an\u00a0-ism, you\u2019ll eventually run out of language \u2014 and then out of listeners. The goal isn\u2019t to out-label your opponent. It\u2019s to out-listen them. Because the side that will win the next decade isn\u2019t the one shouting the loudest.

{"title": "Here's what Donald Trump and Joe Biden have in common on energy policy", "date": "2025-10-29", "body": "Energy Secretary Chris Wright joins \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom\u2019 to discuss energy policy, crude oil prices and the ongoing government shutdown.\nThe late, great philosopher and New York Yankees baseball catcher, Yogi Berra, once declared, \"It's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.\" While Berra was referring to something relating to America\u2019s favorite pastime, the same could be said about recent decisions by the Trump administration tocancel offshore wind projectsup and down the East Coast, especially in comparison to the Biden administration\u2019s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline.\nAt first blush, these decisions might seem like exact opposites \u2014 one focused on renewable energy, the other at fossil fuels. But in reality, they are both political decisions that hurt confidence in theenergy industry, jeopardize jobs and ultimately affect our nation\u2019s domestic energy security. Predictability matters most when it comes to companies and workers in the energy field, whether you\u2019re laying gas pipelines, exploring for oil or constructing wind farms.\nAnd I\u2019m not alone in expressing these concerns. In recent weeks, Colette Hirstius, president of Shell USA, publicly questioned the Trump administration\u2019s decision to halt fully permitted wind projects, asserting it is \"very damaging\" to investment and calling for more consistency in regulation.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump shakes hands with President Joe Biden at Trump's inauguration in the Capitol Rotunda Jan. 20, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images)\nShe reminded observers that \"energy projects with proper permits should be allowed to proceed,\" regardless of political decision-making. Companies like Shell are not simply defending wind farms. Hirstius went further and warned that the same playbook could be used against oil and gas projects.\nTHIS IS HOW AMERICA WILL ACHIEVE ENERGY DOMINANCE\nIn 2020, I served as a surrogate for the Biden campaign because I believed in his pragmatic record of legislative and policy accomplishments. I didn\u2019t agree with PresidentJoe Bidenon every issue, especially his decision to cancel Keystone XL, because it was more symbolic than substantive. No one energy project would have solved all of our energy problems, but Keystone XL represented a critical investment in domestic energy security, buoyed by years of environmental reviews, community engagement, permitting and industry planning. Canceling Keystone XL was wrong.\nLikeKeystone XL, offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, in construction off Rhode Island, and a series of projects near completion, had gone through years of reviews and approvals. Multiple companies had expended billions into planning, workforce training and supply chain development. Thousands of American workers, including welders, steelworkers, engineers and electricians, were relying on these projects forsteady employment.\nCanceling any energy project after construction has started doesn\u2019t just delay bringing on much-needed sources of new energy, it also undermines the very foundation of how we do business in this country. If an approved project can be canceled because of thechange of administrations, why would any company risk the capital to invest in future energy infrastructure? The result is paralysis.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nWe are living through a period defined by both surging energy demand and increasing geopolitical instability. Families are struggling with high energy costs driven by bothconstrained supply and overregulation. The solution here is to pursue domestic energy resources of every kind.\nIn this environment, the commonsense strategy is not to pick winners and losers \u2014 but to pursue an \"all of the above\" energy policy that draws on every resource at our disposal, including oil, gas, nuclear, solar, hydro, and yes, wind. America should be producing more energy, not less. Both the Keystone XL and offshore wind cancellations undercut that vision. Instead of working to maximize capacity and diversify supply, they shrank the pie.\nFor decades, America\u2019s debates over energy have been cast in zero-sum terms: oil and gas vs. renewables, coal jobs vs. clean technology, pipelines vs. wind turbines, with activists and industries battling it out in the courts and the court of public opinion. In reality, these false choices have done little to actually serve our energy, environmental or economic interests as Americans. We need them all \u2013 particularly homegrown, American-made sources of energy.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAn \"all of the above\" energy strategy is not just good economics; it\u2019s also good politics. Voters are tired of the pendulum swings, and tired of being told they have to choose one camp over another. They don\u2019t want energy scarcity and blackouts. They want energy independence \u2013 something PresidentDonald Trumpaggressively campaigned on. They want America to lead, not lag. And they want jobs\u2014whether those jobs are in the oil field, building state-of-the-art reactors or the shipyard assembling wind turbines.\nCanceling Keystone XL was a mistake, and canceling permitted, financed and under construction wind projects is a mistake. If we are serious about achieving energy dominance, these are mistakes Americans just can\u2019t afford.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM KEVIN WALLING\nKevin Walling is a Democratic campaign strategist, former Biden 2020 campaign surrogate, vice president at HGCreative.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nI am in my 33rd year of teaching public school \u2014 and my 30th teaching in New Jersey. I have been a member of theNew Jersey Education Association, our state\u2019s largest teachers union, for as long as I\u2019ve been teaching in the state. Union officials repeatedly told me that contributions to the union\u2019s political action committee were voluntary and separate from our regular membership dues.\nBut during the current election cycle, I learned that the NJEA quietly sent more than $40 million from our dues to a political action committee \u2014 without the knowledge or consent of members, and without a shred of transparency.\nEven worse, union officials used that money \u2014 including my money \u2014 to serve themselves. Those funds fueled former NJEA President Sean Spiller\u2019s failed gubernatorial run, while he was still president of the union. Even when it was quite clear that Spiller had no chance of winning (he ended up finishing a distant fifth in the Democratic primary), PACs supporting him recklessly burned through piles of our dues money as Spiller was on the campaign trail \u2014 all while he somehow also served \"full-time\" as union president, collecting his enormous salary and benefits package from that job.\nI feel betrayed. For years, an FAQ section on the union\u2019s website plainly stated: \"By law, dues money cannot be used for partisan political campaigns.\" But the NJEA seems to have done exactly what it had told members was against the law.\nTEACHER UNION SENDS MAP ERASING ISRAEL TO ITS MILLIONS OF MEMBERS FOR 'INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S DAY'\nSchools count on teachers who are politically neutral.

Both groups used teachers\u2019 dues to promote his gubernatorial campaign.\nI only learned of these PACs through various news reports in the midst of Spiller\u2019s campaign, as mailers promoting his campaign (which I was apparently funding) started piling up at my door.\nWE CAN\u2019T ABOLISH AMERICA'S LARGEST TEACHERS UNION.

We\u2019re also alleging the NJEA breached its fiduciary duty to prioritize members\u2019 interests, not those ofunion insiders.\nAt the same time, the nonprofit New Jersey Policy Institute has alerted the IRS and the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission to potential problems with how the NJEA handled its political spending.\nThey say that the union appears to have failed to report itsmultimillion-dollar donationsto the Garden State Forward PAC as political activity, thus dodging tax rules.

{"title": "'3 headed monster': Expert reveals how H-1B visa program is crushing American college graduates", "date": "2025-10-27", "body": "Fox News Digital spoke to Skillstorm CEO Justin Vianello about how the visa program needs to be fixed to give American workers more opportunity.\nAs theTrump administrationmakes moves to change the\u00a0H-1B visa program to benefit American-born workers, Skillstorm CEO Justin Vianello backed those efforts in an interview with Fox News Digital while offering his expertise on other issues that need to be addressed with work visas.\nVianello told Fox News Digital that one of the \"biggest challenges\" with the current H-1B system is the \"impact\" on college hiring, particularly with computer science and computer engineering graduates.\nVianello explained that the unemployment rate for college graduates with those degrees is significantly higher than the average for all college graduates and there is a \"concerning\" level of unemployment with college graduates in IT.\n\"So that basically means they didn't need degrees for the jobs that they're currently in, being significantly under employed,\" Vianello said. \"How does the H-1B visa program impact that? Well, firstly, rough estimates are that there are about 730,000 H-1B holders in the U.S. and about 550,000 dependents. Most of them, in excess of 70% of them, are in IT.\"\nTRUMP\u2019S H-1B VISA REFORM PLAN NEEDS TO PUT AMERICANS FIRST\nThe U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C.(Reuters/Jason Reed)\nVianello went on to explain that data shows H-1B visa holders are paid \"significantly less\" than their counterparts doing equivalent IT roles, which gives them a leg up with employers who are looking to pay less.\n\"I think it gets a little more broadly than that,\" Vianello said. \"In addition to competing with H-1B visa holders, college graduates, especially in IT, are also competing with OPT visa holders. This is optional practical training, basically an extension of the F-1 visa, which is a student visa, which allows you, if you're a STEM graduate, to work in the U.S. for three years following your graduation.\"\n\"Now, the OPT visa holders don't pay Social Security or Medicare taxes, so they're automatically 15% cheaper, and they are typically paid 42% less than their U S counterparts. So as a college grad, you're fighting this three-headed monster. You're graduating with student debt, you've got H-1B visa holders and OPT visa holders who have the ability to take your job and cost an employer significantly less, and then you're competing with the third one, which is the ability of an employer to simply offshore that work.\"\nMany tech companies have embraced the H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, but critics of the program say H-1B holders are often chosen over U.S. citizens for jobs. One of the reasons for this is that foreign workers are tied to their respective employers via the H-1B visa \u2013 as a company is required to sponsor the visa \u2013 and therefore quitting the job could ultimately see foreign workers losing their visa and their ability to legally remain in the country.\nLABOR DAY CELEBRATION: HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CREATING A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR AMERICAN WORKERS\nU.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.(Celal Gunes/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\"The reason I\u2019m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,\" Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk posted on X last year as a\u00a0rift inside the MAGA movement wasraging on the issue.\n\"The intention was good around bringing in people with skills and retaining people in the US that are doing skills and are studying in the universities,\" Vianello said. \"But the outcome to college grads that are competing for those roles has been really bad.\"\nEarlier this year, the Trump administrationunveiled a proposaldesigned to nudge employers toward offering higher salaries or reserving H-1B petitions for jobs that require advanced skills. The rule change, formally published in the Federal Register, came just days after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.\nThe $100,000 fee \u2014 a one-time charge applying only to new H-1B petitions \u2014 will take effect in the next annual lottery, the system the U.S. government uses to select applications once the annual visa cap is reached.\n\"The whole idea is no more will these Big Tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers. They have to pay the government $100,000, then they have to pay the employee, so it\u2019s just not [economical],\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters on Friday as Trump signed the order.\nVianello told Fox News Digital, \"Certainly I think that the $100,000 fee on any new applications is gonna go a long way toward changing behavior, but that's focused on H-1B.\"\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on Sept. 19, 2025.(Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Bloomberg/Getty Images)\n\"We've seen quite a bit of news recently around changes to the OPT visa program as well in terms of limiting the number of visas and limiting the countries that they come from. That's gonna have a significant impact on the pipeline of people coming through as well. And so I believe those measures are gonna start changing the behavior of many of the employers.\"\nThe argument from H-1B supporters that the United States is bringing in the \"best and the brightest\" is a sentiment Vianello pushed back on.\n\"In the last 18 months, according to layoffs.fyi, these large companies have laid off 250,000 tech professionals, but at the same time, the cap for H-1B visas was secured before the end of 2024 for the entire 2025, which is 85,000 people,\" Vianello explained. \"So you're laying off 250,000 U.S. tech workers, but you're applying for the maximum cap that you can for H-1B visa holders. That doesn't make sense. If there's a shortage of skills, why are you laying off 250,000 people? So you can see the way it's structured. It's being used as a labor arbitrage to bring down these large companies' tech costs.\"\nVianello, who came here on a visa, told Fox News Digital he is not opposed to worker visa programs in general, but stressed they shouldn't leave American workers behind.\n\"I fully support using visas to attract top-tier technologists to the U.S. I came here on a Specialty Occupation Visa myself, which required my employer to invest significantly to bring me over,\" Vianello said. \"What I oppose is the misuse of programs like H-1B and OPT as tools for labor arbitrage, which undercuts entry-level opportunities for U.S. tech graduates and distorts the talent market.\"\nFox News Digital\u2019s Michael Dorgan and Amanda Macias contributed to this report.\nAndrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Our success depends on thriving innovation and robust investment \u2013 two integral pieces of our national battle plan.\nBut the third component of victory can\u2019t be overlooked: The U.S. urgently needs evenbetter internet infrastructure. If we don\u2019t extend our advantage in 21st-century connectivity, we will lose the fight for global AI leadership.\nAt this very moment, leaders in D.C. are debating the best approach to AI regulation. On the other side of the country, Silicon Valley is chasing the next breakthrough AI model. But even as the U.S. does both of those things, Beijing is playing a different game.\nThe Chinese Communist Party understands that AI supremacy depends on leveraging a national approach to building the infrastructure and connectivity required to develop and deploy advanced AI systems.(Getty Images)\nTheChinese Communist Partyunderstands that AI supremacy depends not only on data and algorithms, but on leveraging a national approach to building the infrastructure and connectivity required to develop and deploy advanced AI systems. It is building internet infrastructure to leapfrog the U.S.\nTRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA\nFor instance, China is challenging America\u2019s long-standing leadership in Wi-Fi innovation\u00a0by pushing its domestic standards internationally and directing resources into homegrown wireless technologies, both to the detriment of U.S. standards and technology, which have long led the way in Wi-Fi.\nWi-Fi matters because it\u2019s theprimary technologyconsumers use to access AI on their devices. The ability to move, process and deliver data at a large scale is the backbone of AI. Every generative AI query, self-driving vehicle and factory robot depends on light speed and reliable connectivity. If China takes the lead on any kind of internet infrastructure, it will soon take the lead on AI, too.\nThe good news is that the American cable industry has made significant progress in building broadband networks that offer the scale to meet this moment, with 87% already offering gigabit speeds, and even more powerful capabilities on the horizon. Over the past two decades, $340 billion in private capital has been invested to build these powerful networks,\u00a0generating\u00a0$568.7 billion in economic output in 2024 alone and supporting more than 1.3 million jobs nationwide.\nCHINA'S MALIGN INFLUENCE TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF US LIFE. WE ALL NEED TO HELP STOP THEM\nThese infrastructure investments matter \u2013 but they must also be matched by commitment\u00a0from\u00a0government, as part of a national strategy to extend U.S. internet leadership. Such a strategy isn\u2019t just crucial to AI's future use and reliability; it would also amplify the economic impact that such infrastructure has. In California alone, cable infrastructure supports 209,000 jobs and drives $117 billion in state economic impact. Texas and Florida each sustain more than 100,000cable-related jobs.\nThis is what national strength looks like: private capital fueling the public good. And with a national strategy for internet infrastructure, that good could be multiplied on a massive scale.\nDuring a recent tech policy conversation I had with Rep. Brett Guthrie, the House Energy and Commerce Committee chair, he framed the choice starkly: \"We're not competing with Europe to regulate, we're competing with China to innovate.\" He's right. Europe\u2019s overregulation has already left them out of the AI race. The U.S. is still in the race, and if we hope to win it, we must continue to innovate and expand our internet infrastructure.\nAMERICA MUST WIN THE AI RACE \u2013 AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST\nNow is the time to leverage America\u2019s strengths, doubling down on Wi-Fi capacity,broadband connectivity and the infrastructurethat makes them possible. For years, and because of far-sighted national policies, Wi-Fi has been the internet\u2019s workhorse, handling the vast majority of all internet traffic and linking our homes, offices, schools and factories.\nIt\u2019s also a uniquely American success story \u2013 one rooted in the value of permissionless innovation and rules that support the freedom to access public airwaves. Imagine if thefederal governmentmade that story even more successful by further expanding access to Wi-Fi. China wouldn\u2019t have a chance in the AI fight.\nWinning the AI race will require focus and urgency.

Whether this tactic proves effective remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the president has been even more effective than he was in his first term when it comes to getting other nations to honor their commitments.\u00a0This fact has been most prominent when it comes to defense spending.\nIn 2006,America\u2019s NATO alliesagreed to spend\u00a02% of\u00a0their GDP\u00a0on defense. After several years of little progress, the Obama administration secured an\u00a0updated agreement\u00a0in 2014 that all would achieve this goal by 2024.\u00a0Yet when Trump first entered office in 2017, only\u00a0five\u00a0of 28 nations had met that\u00a0mark.\nThe president and his national security team, including me, pressed our allies hard back then to live up to their commitments.\u00a0By 2021, the number of NATO members doing so had\u00a0doubled\u00a0and allied military spending increased considerably.\nPresident Donald Trump, alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaks during a news conference following the NATO Summit on June 25, 2025, in The Hague, Netherlands. On the summit agenda was a new defense investment plan that raised the target for defense spending to 5% of GDP.(Omar Havana/Getty Images)\nFast-forward to 2025.\u00a0Aided by the ongoing war in Ukraine and a European fear of Vladimir Putin, Trump managed to achieve what many thought impossible: convince our NATO allies to spend a whopping\u00a05% of their GDPs\u00a0on defense!\nIn the economic space, the White House has similarly persuaded other nations to live up to past obligations when it comes to trade, using tariffs and other means where necessary to do so. This should be more apparent when it comes to futuretrade talks with China.\nThe communist state has\u00a0violated\u00a0its obligations and reneged on numerous agreements for decades, from the theft of intellectual property to currency manipulation and the unfair subsidization of Chinese companies.

He said the first set of pumpkins harvested received adequate water and came out normal. However, the seeds he planted later endured weeks of heat \u2014 but with no rain.\n\"The thing with pumpkins, when it gets 95, 98 degrees, the pumpkin plant wants to abort the fruit that it just pollinated,\" Freeland said.\nWhen it gets too hot, Freeland said pumpkin plants start to wilt, and their flowers fall off more easily. On a warm day, the flowers stay open for shorter periods of time, which affects pollination.\nFarmers say long periods of heat with no rain can cause pumpkin plants to wilt, which affects pollination.(Fox News)\nFarmers have found ways to alleviate the stress caused by the drought. Freeland added drip irrigation lines to his pumpkin field by pumping water from his well. A water line then allows smaller amounts of water to drip directly onto a plant's roots.\nAgricultural adaptation can be costly and force farmers toraise their prices, although their pumpkins are smaller.\n\"The downside is if you need to raise prices, but your size is not there, that makes it a little more difficult,\" Freeland said. \"They're just smaller, less marketable.\"\nSome farmers installed drip irrigation lines to slowly drip water directly onto the pumpkin's roots.(Fox News)\nCOSTCO SHOPPERS RAVE OVER SEASONAL PIE THAT'S NEARLY 4 POUNDS AND LESS THAN $6\nKatie Osborne\u2019s family farm includes 20 acres of pumpkins and 70 head of cattle.

Four months later, that picture has only grown worse.\nAcross the Midwest, combines sit idle and bins overflow with unsold grain. Corn prices are down nearly 50% since 2022. Soybeans have\u00a0dropped 40%. Fertilizer and equipmentcosts are up\u00a0double digits. And\u00a08 in 10 farmers now say they believe the U.S. is on the brink of another farm crisis reminiscent of the 1980s. They\u2019ve even given it a name: Farmageddon.\nThis time, the crisis isn\u2019t a result of macroeconomic conditions \u2014 it\u2019s a direct result of decisions made by the White House. PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s reckless tariff war is crushing America\u2019s farmers.\nPresident Donald Trump talks to the media after walking off Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Oct. 5, 2025.(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)\nTake soybeans.China has retaliatedon U.S. tariffs with a total boycott of U.S. soybeans, leaving bumper crops rotting in silos across Ohio, Iowa and Illinois. Meanwhile, new tariffs on fertilizer, steel and equipment have driven up production costs for nearly every crop and commodity.\nTRUMP'S TARIFFS FORCE CHINA TO FEEL THE HEAT\nThe math doesn\u2019t pencil out: higher costs on the front end, lower prices and fewer markets on the back end. It\u2019s a squeeze no amount of wishful thinking can fix.\nAnd while U.S. farmers struggle to move their grain, the administration just finalized a bailout for Argentina \u2014 a country that turned around and cut a deal with China to buy its soybeans instead of ours. Think about that: Washington is bailing out a competitor to our farmers on the brink of crisis.\nUnfortunately, we saw this same movie during Trump\u2019s last trade war. Farm bankruptcies soared to record highs, andBrazil walked awaywith our export markets. Now Argentina is lining up to do the same. And everyone knows that once you lose market share, you rarely get it back.\nThis isn\u2019t just economics. It\u2019s deeply personal. It\u2019s the difference between keeping the family farm for another generation and auctioning off the tractor. It\u2019s the creases across anOhio farmer\u2019s faceas he struggles to tell me he\u2019s not sure whether he wants his children to have this way of life.\nTRUMP IS USING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO DO SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER DONE\nAnd the White House is only making it harder. Despite total control of Washington, the president\u2019s party has shut down the government rather than extend enhanced premium tax credits that keep healthcare affordable. Finding affordable healthcare as a farmer is difficult enough as it stands. But now, premiums are set to skyrocket. In fact, in rural countries, they are set to increase an\u00a0average of 107%, a larger increase than in our cities.\nMoreover, when USDA shuts down, farmers get shut out. That means delays to critical farm loans, conservation payments and disaster relief. For farmers, it\u2019s a double whammy: no markets, no safety net, and now, no one to pick up the phone.\nWhat is the solution? Well, the president is floating a $14 billion bailout for farmers \u2014 a temporary fix for a self-inflicted wound. We saw how this went in the first trade war,\u00a0when payments were mismanaged and failed to help the farmers who were the hardest hit.\nEven the president\u2019s allies are skeptical. I agree with Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., who said funding bailouts with tariff revenue is \"like putting a Band-Aid on cancer.\" Farmers don\u2019t want bailouts; they want a fair shake. They want open markets, stable policy and a government that has their back.\nSo let\u2019s be clear: There is a way out of this mess.\nARE PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S TARIFFS ACTUALLY WORKING?\nFirst, reopen the government and extend the enhanced premium tax credits that a\u00a0quarter of all farmers rely on. It\u2019s time to get the USDA back to full strength and ensure that rural families can afford their health coverage.\nSecond, end the trade war that\u2019s hollowing out American agriculture. Stop punishing the very people who feed and fuel this country.\nThird, if the president won\u2019t endhis reckless trade war, Congress must step in to reclaim our constitutional authority over tariff policy. I plan to introduce legislation soon that would require USDA to report on the impact of any proposed tariffs on farm country, giving farmers an extra tool to plan for the future. I welcome my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join.\nAnd finally, let\u2019s expand domestic markets by authorizing year-round E15 fuel. This is a commonsense, bipartisan step that would boost corn demand, lower gas prices and strengthen our energy independence.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThis is only a start, but our farmers need a real plan.\nBecause what\u2019s happening in farm country isn\u2019t some distant problem. It\u2019s America\u2019s problem. When farms go under, towns go quiet. When farmers stop buying seed, tractors and feed, the hardware store closes, the diner empties, and the local school loses its tax base.

Electricians, welders, HVAC technicians, plumbers and heavy-equipment operators are in dangerously short supply, and the gap is widening.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently warned that building America\u2019sartificial intelligence infrastructurewill require an army of electricians.The demand for data centers \u2014 both cloud and AI \u2014 is expected to double year over year. Mike Rowe has been sounding the alarm for years: The most \"essential\" jobs are the ones our culture stopped celebrating.\nHere\u2019s the truth: Without skilled tradesmen, America grinds to a halt. No power. No housing. No data centers. No cloud. No AI.\nWelder Cedric Smith from the documentary \"Skilled.\"(Photo courtesy of 3M)\nYet we keep pushing young people toward four-year degrees, often leaving them with six-figure debt, while treating the trades as a second-class option. Meanwhile, a \"silver tsunami\" is coming as baby boomers and Gen X tradesmen are retiring faster than replacements are entering the field.\nHELP WANTED: US MUST FILL LOTS OF SHIPS-AND-CHIPS JOBS TO BEAT CHINA\nAccording to Rewiring America, we\u2019ll need 1 million additional electricians in the next decade, on top of today\u2019s workforce of about 800,000.\nFailing to emphasize andincentivize skilled workisn\u2019t just a cultural mistake. It\u2019s an economic time bomb.\nFixing the Imbalance: Use the Tax Code\nThe quickest, fairest way to reverse course is through thetax code.\nHere\u2019s our proposal: Create aggressive tax breaks for tradesmen themselves, not just the companies that employ them.\nIf you choose to become an electrician, welder or plumber, you should enjoy the same level of government support that college graduates receive.\nTRUMP ADMIN TACKLES URGENT ELECTRICAL GRID CRISIS AS AI SET TO DOUBLE DEMAND\nIf we can make tips non-taxable for service industry workers, we can certainly extend that logic to the men and women literally rebuildingAmerica\u2019s infrastructure.

Incentivize the behavior that sustains the nation\u2019s backbone.\nBy their late 20s, these tradesmen could be debt-free, earning solid middle- to upper-class wages, buying homes and raising families; not just chasing the American Dream, but rebuilding it.\nCompare that with manycollege gradstoday who are burdened by debt, underemployed and watching automation threaten their jobs.\nWe should reward the work America\u2019s future depends on, not funnel kids into a path that may not exist a decade from now.\nThis is also about national security\nThis isn\u2019t only an economic issue, it\u2019s a national-security one.\nAMERICA HAS THE POWER TO LEAD THE AI REVOLUTION \u2013 AND THE LEADERSHIP TO MAKE IT HAPPEN\nThe Pentagon already warns of labor shortages in shipbuilding and mission-critical infrastructure. Data centers \u2014 the central nervous system of AI and national defense \u2014 are desperate for electricians and cooling technicians.\nWithout a robust pipeline of skilled tradesmen, our ability to compete with China in the AI race collapses before it begins.\nOur national security depends as much on the American welder and HVAC tech as it does on the fighter pilot. It\u2019s time our policies reflected that truth.\nThis isn\u2019t a subsidy; it\u2019s an investment\nCritics will call this a giveaway. They\u2019re wrong.\nTax incentives aren\u2019t handouts.

{"title": "Five ways the Trump administration can save the American Dream and prevent socialism", "date": "2025-10-06", "body": "Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram and Fox News contributor Kim Strassel join 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the government shutdown and the escalating tensions between parties.\nYoung people are demoralized and are turning to the promises of socialism. While socialism is entirely decoupled from reality, young Americans are frustrated, believing that the American Dream is out of reach. In a recent survey, almost a third of Millennials and nearly 40% of Gen Z said they believe they will never own a home.\nWhile wrongly identifying capitalism as the culprit for the ills of cronyism and central planning, including monetary and fiscal policy that has increased the cost of living, their concerns are real and valid. Whereas in the past, there have been periods with high interest rates with reasonable home prices, and periods with low interest rates and high home prices, would-be homebuyers today are contending with both.\nIf a home is the physical embodiment of theAmerican Dream, it shouldn\u2019t feel out of reach. Here are some suggestions to once again make the American Dream attainable.\nFAITH IN AMERICAN DREAM DWINDLES AMID SOUR ECONOMIC SENTIMENTS, POLL FINDS\nLower mortgage rates through more assumable loans\nIt is estimated that less than a quarter of mortgages in the US are assumable. Many homebuyers financed or refinanced their homes during the Fed\u2019s 15-year low-interest rate bonanza and therefore, don\u2019t want to sell their homes and give up their low mortgage interest rates. This has clogged up the housing market.\nFurthermore, today\u2019s mortgage rates, coupled with high housing costs, are making the homes that are available too costly.\nThegovernment should workwith the banks to make more mortgages assumable (of course, making sure the assuming party is creditworthy, and perhaps limiting that to homes that will be primary residences).\nWhile banks generate sizable fees from loan originations, right now, the clogged market is limiting their business anyway. If loan assumability came with a right of first refusal for the lending institution to refinance the remainder needed for the mortgage, it would be a win-win. Banks would increase originations and the blended rate would be lower for homebuyers.\nPlus, taxpayers have helped the banks out a lot, to put it mildly, over the past few decades, sogetting some concessionson their side is quite fair.\nCreate incentives for smaller footprint housing\nOne of the reasons that housing is so expensive is that we have had square footage creep. Homes today, on average, are more than double the size they were in the 1950s. Per US Census Bureau data, new construction homes averaged 983 square feet in the 1950s, 1,200 square feet in the 1960s, around 1,500 square feet in the 1970s and are between 2,200 and 2,300 square feet on average today, even though the household size has shrunk. Note that median data for the period was similar.\nIt's acomplicated matter. Why would a homebuilder choose to build a smaller home when they could make a bigger profit on a larger one for an incremental amount of extra work?\nThis is where tax incentives, both locally and federally, could help prompt builders to build smaller footprint housing that would also be more affordable, particularly for young people.\nFix balance sheets by solving the student loan burden\nEven if a house is in range of a potential homebuyer\u2019s earnings, if they are saddled with debt, making a home purchase becomes a non-starter.\nTheUS governmentis the largest predatory lender in the country, saddling teenagers and young adults with tens of thousands of dollars in debt and delaying their ability to make investments, while enriching colleges and their administrators. Getting the government out of student lending and thereby making colleges and universities right-size education costs to the value the education provides will clean up young people\u2019s personal balance sheets and help make homeownership more attainable.\nYou can read more of my thoughts onhow to do that here.\nAddress rising property taxes and insurance\nIt\u2019s one thing to be able to afford buying a house. It\u2019s quite another thing to afford the ongoing carrying costs. Property taxes and insurance have become incredibly cumbersome. It is reported that, on average, taxes and insurance make up almost a third of single-family mortgage payments, and for 9% of single-family homeowners, taxes and insurance comprise more than half of the mortgage payment.\nThere should be an effort, even if undertaken at the local level, to dial back these costs, or fewer Americans will never be able to afford a house (not to mention the overall questionable moral framework for property taxes).\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAddress corporations buying single family homes\nThis is an area that I wrote about extensively in my last bestselling book, You Will Own Nothing. Before 2010, there was effectively no institutional money buying single-family homes. But, in Q1 2025, nearly 27% of single-family homes purchased were bought by investors, with some portion of that being institutional buyers.\nMany of the institutionally-backed companies convert single-family homes they purchase torental properties, taking those dwellings out of the buyable supply and renting Americans back a shadow of the American Dream.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhile I hate central planning and prefer free markets, there has been nothing free market about the advantages that give these companies the ability to get cheap capital and go in and compete for single-family homes. Additional fees, taxes or limitations, at least until the market is normalized, could be a good way to level the playing field for average Americans.\nThe housing problem may be temporary, as baby boomers will eventually age out and sell their homes. However, it is still worthwhile to come up with solutions today, even if short-term, to make owning a home a realistic, attainable, goal for hardworking Americans.\nCarol Roth is a former investment banker, entrepreneur and author of the new book\"You Will Own Nothing\"Broadside Books.

To do that, they need to see themselves in terms of the unique, transferable gifts they've been given, which can be applied to a wide variety of jobs in just about any industry.\nOne of the best ways I know to identify those gifts is through the idea of \"Working Genius.\" There are six types of work that show up in every job, in every industry:\nThe truth is, none of us is good at all six. Every person in any industry has two types of work that give them energy and joy; this is where your Working Geniuses lie.\nJOBS THAT ARE MOST AT RISK FROM AI, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT\nOn the other hand, everyone has two types that drain them and that they don\u2019t do well.

Let's say that your geniuses are Invention and Tenacity. That means you enjoy developing novel ideas and then pursuing solutions diligently until they are finished.\nAs you look for a job, you can now look far beyond programming and even technology, exploring a much broader spectrum of job opportunities that need someone with your geniuses. In doing this, you\u2019ll realize that there are plenty of roles in a wide variety of industries that need someone like you, and that your prospects of success and job satisfaction will be much higher in a job that fits your talents.\nIronically, you might find that your previous job didn't exactly allow you to use your geniuses.

But intentionally pursuing acareerthat aligns better with their geniuses can lead to them realizing that getting laid off, as hard as it may have been, was exactly what they needed.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOf course, no job is perfect.

While the agency has long maintained that its enforcement efforts are focused on large corporations and the ultra-wealthy, the truth is that small businesses and middle-class families bear the brunt of its actions.\nThe IRS often investigates businesses that take advantage of legal tax breaks, and it's a lot easier for them to go after the little guy than to take on the armies of lawyers and accountants that big businesses have at their disposal. This imbalance is not only unfair, but it is also damaging our economy, killing jobs and undermining the entrepreneurial spirit that defines America.\nIn March, former IRS whistleblowers Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were\u00a0promoted\u00a0to leadership positions at the Treasury Department with the mandate of reforming the IRS.

Shapley and Ziegler certainly have their work cut out for them.\nSEN RICK SCOTT, REP BYRON DONALDS: TRUMP\u00a0AND\u00a0BESSENT'S IRS REFORM: LET\u2019S END JOB-KILLING POLICIES\nTime and again, IRS audits fall disproportionately on small businesses and individuals making less than $400,000 a year.Larger corporationscan afford to absorb the burden of lengthy audits, but for a small business, an audit can be devastating. The process is time-consuming, expensive and distracting, often forcing business owners to divert resources away from serving customers, paying employees and growing their companies.\nA 2023 Government Accountability Office report\u00a0revealed\u00a0that more than 90 percent of audits are against middle-class families and small businesses under the $400,000 threshold. It is clear that major corporations and billionaire tax cheats are not the primary targets in the IRS\u2019s crosshairs.\nThankfully, the previous administration\u2019s desire toexpand the IRSby tens of thousands of new agents was\u00a0thwarted\u00a0by President Donald Trump, who announced a hiring freeze in January\u00a0to protect small businesses and middle-class families from being swept into an audit dragnet. But, Trump\u2019s action also underscored a critical truth: the IRS still wields immense power with far too little accountability, and without serious reform, that power will continue to be abused.\nThe broader economic consequences of this imbalance are enormous. Small businesses are the backbone of job creation in America, yet they are being discouraged from investing, hiring and expanding because they fear the IRS will punish them for success.\nI have spoken with countless entrepreneurs who quietly hold back on growth because they don\u2019t want the extra scrutiny. Thischilling effectis invisible to most policymakers, but it is real. When entrepreneurs choose caution over expansion, jobs are not created, innovation is stifled and communities miss out on economic opportunity.\nMeanwhile, the compliance burden gives large corporations a competitive advantage, because they can hire teams of professionals to handle audits and disputes while smaller firms are left exposed. The result is a system that entrenches big business and suppresses competition, the exact opposite of what a healthy free-market economy should promote.\nWe can and must do better.Reforming the IRSshould begin with rebalancing its priorities. Enforcement is important, but it should not come at the expense of fairness and service. Congress should establish clear limits on how many small business returns can be audited each year and require the IRS to justify its audit selections with transparent metrics. Independent appeals processes must be strengthened so that small businesses can contest government overreach without going bankrupt in the process.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAny new IRS funding should be redirected toward improving taxpayer services, simplifying compliance, and providing timely guidance. The IRS should also be required to publicly report audit outcomes, including how many audits end with no changes or in favor of taxpayers, so Americans can see for themselves whether enforcement is being carried out fairly.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSmall businesses are not asking for special treatment; they are asking for a level playing field. They are willing to pay their fair share, but they should not be disproportionately burdened simply because they lack the resources to fight back. America\u2019s prosperity has always been built on the backs of entrepreneurs willing to take risks and create opportunities. If those individuals believe every step forward might trigger a costly audit, many will hesitate and our economy will suffer.\nFor the sake of fairness, for the sake of growth and for the sake of America\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit, we need toreform the IRSnow. An agency that punishes the vulnerable while letting the powerful escape scrutiny is not serving the people. A tax system that discourages job creation is failing the nation. If we want small businesses to thrive and the economy to grow, we must put the little guy back on an equal footing and make the IRS accountable to the people it is meant to serve.\nJulio\u00a0Gonzalez\u00a0is the CEO\u00a0and founder of Engineered Tax Services Inc.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/agency-targets-individual-americans-small-businesses-must-reformed"}

Just this year, the price per kilowatt-hour has jumped another 6%.\nTRUMP'S UN SPEECH REVEALS INCONVENIENT TRUTH OF MASSIVE GREEN ENERGY COSTS\nIn California, the trends are even worse as Golden State residents pay almost double the average charge in the U.S. People living in New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts are similarly paying much higher prices than the national average. Why the disparity? Because Democrat-run states have purposefully shifted to high-cost and unreliable renewable energy.\nThe Sherburne County Generating Station is pictured in Becker, Minnesota.(Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\nIn New York, as governor, Andrew Cuomo banned fracking and banned new pipelines from bringing much-needed and cheaper natural gas into his state. New Jersey and other blue states promoted similar measures, while embracing renewables like offshore wind and solar that are intermittent and therefore need backup, usually provided by natural gas. This is not efficient, and it is costly.\nUnlike the Biden administration, theTrump White House understandsthat the demand for energy over the next few years, thanks in particular to AI and other new technologies, will expand at a pace that will truly demand an \"all of the above\" approach. That means not just increased oil and natural gas production, investments in solar and other renewables, but alsomore reliance on nuclear powerand \u2014 yes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0on coal.\nTRUMP'S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS\nPresidentBarack Obama,Biden and other climate warriors have, for years, waged war against coal, which today accounts for 15% of electricity production, down from half as recently as 2000. In 2016, then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proudly claimed her cleanenergypolicies would \"put a lot ofcoal minersand coal companies out of business,\" a boneheaded remark that showed how out of touch the former first lady was with the needs of working-class Americans. At the time, there were some 70,000 coal miners in the U.S.; today, that has shrunk to 40,000.\nPresidentDonald Trumprecognizes that one of the greatest assets of the United States, enhancing our ability to compete in next-generation technology, is our abundant cheap energy, and especially coal. The government\u2019s Energy Information Administration wrote last year, \"In the United States, coal resources are larger than remaining natural gas and oil resources.\" In addition, it reported that, \"As of Jan. 1, 2024, the demonstrated reserve base (DRB) was estimated to contain 469 billion short tons of coal.\"\nThe 2024 production was just above 500 million short tons, or less than half of the amount produced in 2008. Roughly speaking, we could double current coal output and produce at that level for hundreds of years. That is not an asset any government should ignore.\nThe Chinese certainly would not let such a reserve go to waste. While the U.S. and Europe sacrifice using cheap coal in favor of higher-cost renewables in their quest to cut carbon emissions, theChinese are building coal-fired power plantsas rapidly as they can, the environmental consequences be damned.\nTRUMP ADMIN PUTS $625M TOWARD KEEPING COAL PLANTS OPEN, LOWER ENERGY COSTS\nWhile China is opening coal plants, the U.S. has been shutting ours down. The White House will change that. The government is planning tospend $625 million,including $350 million to modernize coal plants, $175 million for coal projects that will target rural communities and some $100 million to make existing plants cleaner and more efficient. Overall, the objective is to keep more plants running, including dozens that were slated to close.\nThis is not the first move made by the Trump White House to expand coal\u2019s role in our energy system. In spring, the president signed an executive order instructing the head of the National Energy Dominance Council to designate coal as a \"mineral\"; the purpose was to \"streamline permitting,\"\u00a0which would allow more leasing and ultimately more production overall, and, specifically, on federal lands. The\u00a0president also demanded that agencies reduce \"barriers\" to coal mining and \"rescind any agency policies that seek to transition the nation away from coal production.\"\nSmoke and steam rise from a coal processing plant in Hejin in central China's Shanxi Province on Nov. 28, 2019.(AP Photo/Olivia Zhang, File)\nWright told Bartiromo that,\"We\u2019re going to export more of that coal, we\u2019re going to use it for American industry, particularly as we reindustrialize, and it\u2019s going to continue to provide 15%-16% of our electricity and enable us to reindustrialize and win the AI race.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe Trump administration is not just focused on coal.

The rollout suffered from muddled communication, and the order does not stop the H-1B from being used to replace American workers \u2014 but it\u2019s a sorely needed first step.\nCreated more than 30 years ago to fill a temporary labor shortage, the H-1B has ballooned beyond its intended scope. It needs to be reformed to put American workers first.\nExplaining how the H-1B went so far off the rails would take a whole report \u2014 which is why I\u2019ve written one, coming out soon. Meanwhile, here are some of the problems.\nTRUMP\u2019S $100K H-1B VISA OVERHAUL COULD HIT TECH GIANTS LIKE AMAZON AND MICROSOFT HARDEST\nH-1Bs allow companies to replace American workers with cheap foreign labor and suppress wages for Americans. Exceptions to the original H-1B annual cap of 65,000 visas each fiscal year have expanded the number far beyond statutory limits.\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order about H-1B visas at the White House on Friday, Sept. 19, 2025.(Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Bloomberg/Getty Images)\nFirst, 20,000 more were set aside for applicants with a master's degree or higher degree. Then, H-1Bs for universities and government research organizations were made cap-exempt. Then DHS allowed the spouses of H-1B holders to work.\nFraud, nepotism and corruption have long compromised the H-1B process. Outsourcing firms and \"body shops\" rig the labor market to hire foreign workers over Americans.\nFOREIGN TRAVELERS SOON TO PAY 'VISA INTEGRITY FEE' TO VISIT THE U.S. COSTING $250\nYet there is no shortage of domestic science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) graduates. Every year, the U.S. produces more graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer science and engineering than the economy demands, and overall, only 28% of workers with a STEM degree actually work in a STEM job.\nThere are some high-talent H-1Bs, but as Howard University Political Science Professor Ron Hira says, the typical H-1B recipients \"are ordinary skilled workers\" who could be supplied domestically.\nAmazon, Intel, Google, Microsoft and many other companies have let American workers go while they continued to hire thousands of H-1Bs. Companies predictably deny any connection between the two phenomena, but laid-off U.S. workers insist otherwise. In 2020, the site White Collar Workers of America ranked the \"Misfortune 500\" body shops most-abusive of H-1Bs. In some cases, companies even require Americans they are sacking to train their foreign replacements.\nOn Sept. 25, Iowa Republican Sen.Chuck Grassleyand Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin wrote to the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and other large American companies asking for specific information about their hiring of H-1Bs, saying \"we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions.\"\nDOJ CALLS FOR TIPS ON EMPLOYERS FAVORING FOREIGN WORKERS IN HIRING PRACTICES\nH-1Bs were supposed to be limited to three years, but holders can renew up to six years. And if an alien can\u2019t get a green card because of the cap (no one country is allowed more than 7% of the annual visas), he can get three-year extensions indefinitely.\nMany of the top employers of H-1B workers are foreign-based outsourcers who hire thousands of low-wage H-1Bs and farm them out to U.S. industry. More than 70% of new H-1B workers are from India, with China a distant second at 11%.\nH-1Bs allow companies to replace American workers with cheap foreign labor and suppress wages for Americans. Exceptions to the original H-1B annual cap of 65,000 visas each fiscal year have expanded the number far beyond statutory limits.\nBy going through an outsourcing firm, U.S. companies can pay less and avoid negative publicity when replacing Americans. In 2024, hundreds of subcontractors filed for H-1Bs on behalf of Verizon, Wells Fargo, and Walmart. From 2020 to 2024, Citigroup hired more than 3,000 new H-1B workers via outsourcers, who paid them less than those Citi hired directly.\nMany H-1B subcontractors commit unscrupulous or illegal practices. In 2024, Kishore Dattapuram and Kumar Aswapathi, owners of Nanosemantics in San Jose, California, pled guilty in an H-1B visa case. According to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, \"In pleading guilty, Dattapuram admitted to working with Aswapathi and Giri to submit fraudulent H-1B applications that falsely represented that foreign workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated end-client companies when, in fact, the jobs did not exist.\"\nKEY IMMIGRATION PROPOSAL VOWS TO END 'BACKDOOR HIRING PRACTICES' IN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES\nOutsourcing giant Cognizant has successfully petitioned for over 52,000 new H-1B workers since 2009, the highest of any company. In 2024, Cognizant was found liable for intentionally discriminating against more than 2,000 non-Indian employees between 2013 and 2022.\nAmerican workers at Cognizant were twice as likely to be fired or resign than workers on visas, and, \"Black employees were let go at a rate 23 times that of Asian workers.\" According to Bloomberg, \"each of the five largest outsourcing companies has either settled, lost or is currently fighting a discrimination lawsuit\" within the last four years.\" Yet they are allowed to continue petitioning for new workers.\nTheH-1B salary minimumwas set at $60,000 in the 1990s but has not been adjusted for inflation. Employers must attest that they will pay new H-1Bs at least the prevailing wage, but a July 2025 Heritage Foundation report showed most H-1B positions pay below-average salaries.\nMicrosoft reportedly pays 82% of its foreign workers less than the market wage. Accounting giant Deloitte paid H-1B workers 10% less than Americans in similar roles. Many universities use their cap-exempt status to recruit foreign workers over their own graduates.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe most corrupt element in the H-1B pipeline is when they convert to permanent residence. This \"PERM process,\" according to a 2020 Department of Labor report, \"relentlessly has employers not complying with the qualifying criteria\" \u2014 because it is a hoop which they must reluctantly jump through before they can hire their preferred, foreign candidate into a job.\nThe law requires PERMjobsto be advertised, but companies try to hide them. They try to minimally advertise open positions while avoiding qualified American applicants.\nH-1Bs were supposed to be limited to three years, but holders can renew up to six years. And if an alien can\u2019t get a green card because of the cap (no one country is allowed more than 7% of the annual visas), he can get three-year extensions indefinitely.\nIn 2021,Facebook (Meta) was fined $4.75 millionfor intentionally denying qualified U.S. workers a fair opportunity to apply for jobs that it had reserved for H-1Bs. In 2023, Apple paid $25 million for similar discrimination. But these fines are minuscule compared with the profits from bringing in cheap labor.\nIn 2025, a group of veteran tech workers set up the site www.jobs.now. They find deliberately obscure job advertisements and post them, advising applicants to file complaints with the Department of Justice if they believe they were unfairly rejected.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAt a time when 6.1% of recent college graduates with computer science majors are unemployed, allowing thousands of foreign workers to compete against them on unfair terms makes no sense.\nCharging new H-1B petitioners $100,000 will be a body blow to body shops. But it will leave open many other side doors to unfair competition.

Gen\u00a0Z\u00a0is rewriting the rules. Many value\u00a0personal freedom, career growth and travel\u00a0over traditional milestones like marriage and children. Happiness doesn\u2019t have to mean a spouse and two\u00a0kids\u00a0in the suburbs\u00a0anymore \u2013 it can mean financial independence,meaningful workor even online communities.\nAnd then there\u2019s mental health. This\u00a0generation\u00a0reports\u00a0the highest levels ofanxiety and depressionof any living age group. For some, the idea of managing their own mental well-being is enough of a challenge, let alone taking on the responsibility of raising children.\nGen\u00a0Z\u00a0is also the first\u00a0generation\u00a0to grow up with climate change drilled into their heads from childhood. Polls show\u00a0nearly 40% cite environmental concerns\u00a0as a reason to delay or avoid having children altogether.

Despite decades of progress, women still shoulder most child care responsibilities. Many in Gen\u00a0Z\u00a0simply don\u2019t see motherhood as compatible with their career ambitions or the lifestyle they\u00a0want. With more opportunities than ever before for women in corporate American and entrepreneurial ventures, some women are unwilling to pay the price \u2013 in time, money and freedom \u2013 that comes with raising a child.\nThe Bigger Problem for America\nHere\u2019s the issue: America needs babies. In 1960, the average woman had 3.6 children. Today, it\u2019s just 1.6 \u2013 well below the replacement rate needed to sustain a healthy population. If these trends continue, we\u2019ll face shrinking tax bases, fewer workers to support Social Security and an aging population that strains the system.\nThis isn\u2019t just a lifestyle choice by Gen\u00a0Z \u2013 it\u2019s a looming demographic crisis for the country.\u00a0 And a looming problem for Gen X parents hoping their\u00a0kids\u00a0will give them a bunch of grandchildren.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAs a financial advisor, I understand the hesitation.\u00a0As a parent, it\u2019s tough to swallow.

However, he is earning that title now that his agency is taking on costlyBiden-era car regulationsthat would have disproportionately hurt those most in need of affordable transportation.\nSpecifically, theEPAhas proposed therepeal of new tailpipe standardsthat would have tacked on an agency-estimated $2,100 to the already-rising sticker prices for new gasoline-powered vehicles. The rule was a major part of the previous administration\u2019s aggressive agenda to force a transition away from gasoline toelectric vehicles (EVs).The agency is also reconsidering the underlying 2009 Obama administration finding that opened the door to this new crackdown on tailpipe emissions by allowing climate change considerations to play a role.\nThe environmental benefits are highly questionable \u2014 even proponents shy away from saying that compliant vehicles would have a measurable impact in reducing future temperatures \u2014 but the costs are real and hurt some much more than others.\nTRUMP ADMIN SCORES LEGAL WIN IN $16B CLIMATE FIGHT AS FEDERAL APPEALS COURT LIFTS BLOCK ON GRANT TERMINATIONS\nAffordable personal transportation is absolutely essential for those still climbing the economic ladder. Putting aside the near worship by some of public transit, the reality is that buses and trains can only take you to a subset of the job choices available if you can drive door to door. This is especially true of those who live in relatively poor neighborhoods far from the most promising employers in town. A vehicle also opens up opportunities in the gig economy. Not surprisingly, studies identify vehicle ownership as an important factor in reducing the racial wage gap.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is helping Americans keep their cars affordable.(Getty Images)\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nBut these gains are threatened by rising new car prices, which would only worsen as these Biden-era regulations continue to get more stringent in the years ahead. And used car prices generally rise in tandem with new ones.\nBeyond making vehicles prohibitively expensive for some, higher prices also create financing challenges for others, including reliance on high-interest sub-prime loans. Not surprisingly, vehicle loan delinquency rates are at a 30-year high.\nTRUMP ADMIN EYES OVERTURNING BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY LEGACY TO TUNE OF $7B\nNor are EVs a viable option for those not yet in the middle class.

General Assembly, PresidentDonald Trumpdrew global headlines by blasting what he called the \"extreme cost\" of thegreen transition,arguing that climate alarmism is impoverishing ordinary people while enriching elites. Whatever one thinks of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, he touched on an inconvenient truth: despite endless assurances from campaigners and institutions like the U.N., World Bank, and World Economic Forum,wind and solarare still not delivering cheap energy. In fact, they are making electricity more expensive.\nFor years, media and green advocates have insisted that solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of electricity. This claim is central to the idea that a green transition is inevitable and beneficial \u2014 even under a second Trump administration. But two decades of evidence shows the opposite. The countries that have added the most solar and wind also have the highest power costs.\nThe claim of \"cheap\" solar and wind is built on a sleight of hand. These sources are indeed often competitive when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. But modern societies need power 24/7. When the sun is not shining and the wind not blowing, countries must rely on costly backup \u2014 mostly fossil fuels. Factoring in these costs reveals that renewables are far from cheap.\nWORLD LEADERS LAUGH, SQUIRM AS TRUMP BLASTS UN ON CLIMATE, UKRAINE, GAZA AT GENERAL ASSEMBLY\nA\u00a0study of China\u00a0found solar\u2019s real cost was twice that of coal.\u00a0Research about Germany and Texas\u00a0showed that once backup costs are included, solar and wind go from appearing slightly cheaper to many times more expensive.\nPresident Donald Trump delivers remarks to the United Nations General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York City on Sept. 23, 2025. (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)\nWe see this in consumer prices. Germany, Spain, Denmark and the U.K. have some of the world\u2019s highest electricity costs alongside massive investments in renewables. Last year, households and industries in the EU paid more than 26 cents per kilowatt-hour, more than double the U.S. price of 13 cents and triple the price in China. The U.K., with its even greener ambition, paid an eye-watering 36 cents per kilowatt-hour, nearly three times the U.S. price and more than four times the price in China.\nAcross 70 countries, International Energy Agency data shows a clear pattern:\u00a0more renewables, higher costs. Every 10% increase in the share of wind and solar raises average power costs by over four cents per kilowatt-hour.\nHeadlines often tout how Germany and other nations and states generate most of their electricity from renewables. But these stories never mention the dark, windless days when solar and wind provide almost nothing. Last winter, renewables repeatedly delivered less than 4% of Germany\u2019s power for an entire day.\nTRUMP'S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS\nAdvocates say batteries will fix this problem. But all of Germany\u2019s storage would last less than 20 minutes. The reality:fossil fuelsremain essential, but because they now run less frequently, costs soar.

A German utility CEO\u00a0warned\u00a0the country narrowly avoided blackouts only because the weather wasn\u2019t colder.\nIf solar and wind were truly cheaper, poor countries would leapfrog to them. Yet the opposite is happening. Across developing nations, electricity demand rose almost 5% last year \u2014 mostly met by fossil fuels. China used more additional coal than it used additional solar and wind combined. Bangladesh used 13 times more additional coal than additional renewables.\n'WEB OF DARK MONEY' TIED TO OBAMA, DEMS FUELS GREEN OPPOSITION TO CRUCIAL TRUMP ENERGY PLAN\nIndia, praised for ambitious solar goals, still added three times more coal than solar and wind. Billionaire Gautam Adani, struggling to find buyers for a $6 billion solar project, allegedly resorted to a\u00a0$265 million bribery scheme \u2014 because most Indian states refuse to rely on unreliable renewables.\nPoor nations know reliability matters. Rich nations can indulge the solar-and-wind illusion only because they already have fossil backups and lavish subsidies.\nOn May, 26, 2021, rows of solar panels at the Toms River Solar Farm, which was built on an EPA Superfund site in Toms River, New Jersey.(REUTERS/Dane Rhys)\nEurope\u2019s high prices at least reflect the true costs of renewables. The U.S. disguises them through subsidies. Federal tax credits for wind and solar alone cost\u00a0nearly $18 billion in 2024, with\u00a0states adding billions more. In Texas alone, total subsidies may have reached nearly $20 billion in 2023 \u2014 10 times the federal subsidies.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAcross the U.S., hidden subsidies may exceed $60 billion annually, meaning real power costs are about 25% higher than official bills suggest.\nGARGANTUAN \u2018BIRD CEMETERIES\u2019 IN BURGUM\u2019S CROSSHAIRS AS DOI LOOKS TO CURB GREEN WIND PROJECTS\nThe myth of cheap renewables is comforting but destructive. It sustains a system of rising bills and endless subsidies, hitting the poorest hardest.\nAdvocates say batteries will fix this problem. But all of Germany\u2019s storage would last less than 20 minutes.\nTrump is right to call out the economic damage of today\u2019s climate policies. But the solution is not to ignoreclimate change\u2014 it is to pursue smarter ones. We should focus on innovation that can genuinely make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels. This means dramatically more investment in research and development: from advanced nuclear to more reliable renewables with storage to geothermal breakthroughs.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSuch investments would cost far less than today\u2019s climate spending and deliver real benefits. Until then, fossil fuels will remain indispensable. Pretending otherwise onlymakes energy more costlyand less secure.\nThe world needs honesty: solar and wind are not yet cheap because they need backup, and forcing them onto power grids only raises prices.

That amount is enough to supply about 55,000 homes each year.\nWisconsin\u2019s first large-scale solar battery park combines solar power with storage, providing reliable clean energy day and night.(We Energies)\nNow, a 110-megawatt battery storage system has been added. These batteries capture excess energy from the solar panels and release it at night, during cloudy weather, or when demand suddenly rises. The battery system can power about 130,000 homes for up to four hours.\nBy combining solar generation with battery storage, Wisconsin is addressing one of renewable energy's most significant challenges: ensuring a steady and reliable power supply at all times.\nNEW TESLA SOLAR-POWERED CHARGING STATION OPENS\nEnergy useis climbing, and nearly 79 percent of electricity in the United States still comes from fossil fuels. That dependence contributes to increased carbon pollution, higher costs and leaves the grid vulnerable during extreme conditions.\nThe Paris Solar-Battery Park reduces reliance on fossil fuels while strengthening Wisconsin's grid. It also provides a model other states can follow.\nMike Hooper, president of project partner We Energies, called the project\u00a0\"historic\" and stressed that customers can count on dependable and affordable power in any weather. That level of reliability is especially crucial as storms, heatwaves and cold snaps put additional pressure on power systems.\nMassive battery storage units at the Paris Solar-Battery Park capture solar energy for use during nights and peak demand.(We Energies)\nBattery storage is becoming a cornerstone of the clean energy movement. Without storage, solar power only helps while the sun is shining. With it, renewable energy becomes flexible, consistent and available around the clock.\nThis shift benefits both the environment and consumers. Solar farms have been shown to cut electric bills by 5 to 20 percent. Additionally, the Paris Solar-Battery Park is eligible forfederal tax credits, which can pass on savings to residents.\nRecent policy changes may reduce some of those incentives in the future. Even so, pairing solar with battery storage remains one of the most effective ways to lower costs and reduce emissions.\nENERGY-SUCKING AI DATA CENTERS CAN LOOK HERE FOR POWER INSTEAD\nRows of solar panels and battery units at Wisconsin\u2019s Paris Solar-Battery Park in Kenosha County.(We Energies)\nIf you live in Wisconsin, you may soon experience the benefits through cleaner air, lower utility bills and fewer outages.

In one calculated move, Beijing demonstrated its power to hobble the West.\nThis economic warfare represents decades of strategic planning. While America slept,Chinacornered the market on materials essential to modern civilization. By controlling 90% of rare-earth processing capacity, it dictates prices and decides who receives supplies. The periodic table became their ultimate economic weapon.\nBut weapons can be rendered obsolete through superior innovation. American scientists discovered that combining iron, the planet's fourth-most abundant element, with atmospheric nitrogen makes a compound more magnetic than anything produced by China. This breakthrough doesn't just match Chinese materials; it surpasses them.\nUS \u2018ABSOLUTELY\u2019 HAS ENOUGH RESOURCES TO BE RARE-EARTH INDEPENDENT AND DOMINANT, CLAIMS CEO\nChina's rare-earth monopoly began formingin the 1980s.

European manufacturers suffered even worse disruptions.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nSoon, the crisis had spread beyond cars. Aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and defense contractors all discovered their dependence on materials that Beijing could weaponize without warning. This represented the culmination of China's three-decade strategy to corner critical mineral markets while American companies chased quarterly profits and policymakers prioritized cheap consumer goods over strategic independence.\nCHINA'S RARE EARTH TECH OBSESSION ENSNARES US RESIDENT AS CCP LOOKS TO MAINTAIN STRANGLEHOLD\nYet, while China was tightening its grip,American researchersat the University of Minnesota had been solving a puzzle that had frustrated scientists since the 1950s. Professor Jian-Ping Wang spent nearly a decade perfecting techniques to synthesize iron nitride magnets from the most abundant elements on Earth. His breakthrough, published in 2010, finally explained how combining iron with nitrogen can create a material with magnetization exceeding anything China produces from rare earths.\nThe physics is remarkable. Iron nitride retains full magnetization at 200 degrees Celsius, exceeding the temperature capability of all magnet compounds except those made from the scarcest and most expensive critical elements. Most importantly, the raw materials come from sources no nation can monopolize: Minnesota's iron ore deposits and atmospheric nitrogen. Iron nitride represents something China cannot replicate \u2014 American innovation driven by scientific curiosity rather than stateindustrial policy \u2014and reduces ournational securityand economic vulnerabilities while strengthening domestic manufacturing capacity.\nYet commercializing this breakthrough requires the same strategic commitment China demonstrated while building rare-earth dominance.Beijing spent hundreds of billions of dollarsover three decades, accepting losses to achieve market control.

{"title": "Are Americans ready for the reality of socialism?", "date": "2025-09-16", "body": "\u2018The Faulkner Focus\u2019 panelists Julian Epstein and Jeremy Hunt discusses a new Gallup poll on the popularity of socialism and capitalism in America.\nThe recent New York primary win by Democrat Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed socialist, raises the question that has been simmering for years: Is America ready for socialism?\nOur nationwide survey of 2,067 college and university students across the U.S. suggests the answer starts with another question: What constitutes socialism? Only 34% of students define socialism as state ownership and central planning, the classic definition. Almost half instead define it as active government and redistribution, and many admit they are unsure. This confusion shapes how people talk about socialism and why it polls well with young voters.\nPoliticians have helped blur the lines by pointing to places such as Nordic countries like Sweden as models of\"democratic socialism,\"claiming they are successful models of what it could look like in the U.S. But Sweden is not a socialist economy. The policies endorsed by Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Democrat Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,Mamdani and others \u2014 like implementing awealth tax,increasing inheritance taxes, corporate taxes and income taxes to pay for a large welfare state \u2014 are not the policies of Sweden. It is a market-based system with high taxes that fund a generous welfare state.\nUS SUPPORT FOR CAPITALISM SINKS TO NEW LOW IN GALLUP POLL\nWhile the tax burden for individuals is relatively high in Sweden, the Swedish government notes that itswelfare systemis built on the principle that everyone pays, not just the rich. The top marginal income tax rate is higher in Sweden than in the U.S. But these higher taxes aren\u2019t just being paid by the rich in Sweden. The top rate applies to everyone earning barely above the national average in Sweden, compared to the U.S. where the highest rate is paid by those earning 800% higher than the national average.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pose for a photo in Astoria, Queens, Sept. 6, 2025.(@ZohranKMamdani via X)\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nMoreover,Swedenimposes a 25% consumption tax on goods and services, versus state and local sales taxes in the U.S. that average 7.7%. Sweden also has no wealth tax, no inheritance tax and a lower corporate tax rate than in the U.S.\nSweden learned the hard way what happens when it moved toward the kind of policies advocated for by\"democratic socialists.\"As highlighted by Johan Norberg and others, for almost 100 years, the country had a small government and an open economy until the country experimented withsocialismin the \u201970s and \u201980s. During that time, they expanded the size of government, increased income taxes, introduced a wealth tax and an inheritance tax. Iconic companies like IKEA left the country, growth stalled and the country experienced a financial crisis that forced major reforms in the early 1990s. Today, Sweden is one of the most economically free countries in the world.\nFETTERMAN RIPS \u2018LEFTIES\u2019 IN DEM PARTY, SAYING PEOPLE IN EX-COMMUNIST NATION TOLD HIM \u2018YOU ARE MORONS'\nSo, what do young Americans want? When we asked students whether they are in favor of universal healthcare and free higher education, 78% said yes if it is funded by a wealth tax on the top 1%. Seventy-one percent said yes if funded by higher incometaxeson the top 10%. When asked whether they were in favor of these things if funded by a universal consumption tax, support dropped to half. When funded by a higher income tax on most people, only 38% were in favor. Clearly, college students (and presumably other Americans who are in favor of these things) are much more in favor of a larger welfare state if somebody else foots the bill.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHistory and economics show that the systems built on ever-expanding government eventually hit a wall. As the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously said, \"The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people\u2019s money.\"\nBefore America decides it is ready for socialism, it\u2019s clear we need to get educated on what it actually means and what it really costs. Only then can we truly debate whether socialism is \"a commitment to dignity,\" as Mamdani says, or whether it is a prescription for ruin.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOHN BITZAN\nJohn Bitzan is a professor\u00a0of\u00a0management and\u00a0the\u00a0Menard Family Director at\u00a0the\u00a0Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth at North Dakota State University.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/americans-ready-reality-socialism"}
{"title": "5 things that explain the Hyundai immigration debacle", "date": "2025-09-12", "body": "Former Dallas Fed advisor Danielle DiMartino Booth discusses the I.C.E. raid at a Hyundai plant and the heated exchange between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and FHFA Director Bill Pulte on 'The Will Cain Show.'\nWhen ICE visited a new battery plant run\u00a0by\u00a0theKorean firm\u00a0Hyundailast week, they went to find several aliens working there illegally \u2013 from Latin America. They were probably not expecting to roll up\u00a0hundreds of illegal South Korean workers at the same time.\nThis came as a surprise to the national media and even some immigration experts. But the problems underlying ICE\u2019s\u00a0haul ofillegal Korean laborare no secret.\nFirst, the B visitor\u2019s visa. The B-1 is for business trips, the B-2 is for personal reasons like tourism or visiting relatives. There are so many different things an alien can do on a B that they are normally issued as one\u00a0B1/B2\u00a0visa to keep it simple.\nFederal agents detain workers during an immigration raid at the Hyundai battery plant construction site in Ellabell, Georgia.(ATF)\nThe B visa only allows a foreigner to apply for entry to the U.S. at an air or land port. There, Customs and Border Protection lets them in for a certain period. Most often, that is six months.\nTRUMP COULD SECURE HIS PLACE IN AMERICAN HISTORY WITH THIS BOLD IMMIGRATION REFORM STRATEGY\nAlthough an alien can\u2019t work full-time on a B visa for an extended period, they are permitted to\u00a0have meetings, repair or install complex, proprietary machinery, and carry out specialist training forAmerican workers. So, some of the Koreans could\u00a0have applied for B visas and\u00a0have come to Georgia to work on machinery or train Americans to do it. So far, so legal.\nBut Koreans are also allowed to enter the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) for up to 90 days for business or pleasure. Under the VWP, they are expressly not allowed to work. Still, visitors from many countries\u00a0have abused the VWP, for example Israeli youth coming on VWP and selling Dead Sea salts in shopping malls for the summer, or Chileans coming to commit organized burglary.\nIt seems that some of the Koreans came under the VWP and were working illegally. Most probably, they were working for subcontractors that\u00a0Hyundai\u00a0hired for labor.\u00a0Hyundai may\u00a0have done so in good faith, assuming that the subcontractors were doing due diligence. But using subcontractors to avoid scrutiny and bring in cheap labor is a common tactic among big and small American and foreign companies.\nFLORIDA TRAGEDY SHOWS WHY TRUMP\u2019S TRUCKING LICENSE CRACKDOWN IS NEEDED\nThen there is the\u00a0H-1B. Despite their statutory purpose, and several attempts to fix loopholes,\u00a0H-1Bs\u00a0have been abused to replace American workers and as a source of cheap labor for a generation. U.S. companies from Alphabet to Walmart employ\u00a0hundreds of thousands ofH-1B foreign workers, sometimes directly but often through outsourcing companies like Cognizant,\u00a0HCL or Tata Consultancy Services. Most of the big ones are based in India or owned\u00a0by\u00a0Indians, and India is the source of nearly all their workers.\nIn addition to the\u00a0H-1B, companies also misuse the\u00a0L visa, which is for intra-company transfers. In theory, this should be for a foreign company, like Volvo or Toshiba, to bring in an executive for a few years to work in their U.S. branch then go\u00a0home.\u00a0However, the L\u00a0has been abused\u00a0by\u00a0mom-and-pop motels and restaurants to bring in relatives, and as a back door when the\u00a0H-1B annual numerical caps are reached.\nABOUT THOSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES\nWhen I was issuing visas in India 25 years ago, large Indian out-sourcing/consultancy firms would\u00a0hire young people out of college. After the minimum 12 months that they\u00a0had to work for the company before being eligible for an L visa, they would send them to work for their U.S. subsidiary. They would farm them out as \"consultants\" to American companies, taking a fat cut.\nApart from thevisa fraud and abuse, the\u00a0Hyundai debacle sheds light on one other question: if\u00a0Hyundai wants to\u00a0hire Americans, can they? In the skilled technical areas, yes \u2013 there are plenty of U.S. STEM graduates not working in that field, and unemployment for recent graduates is twice that of older workers. But factories need skilled blue-collar labor too. In Georgia, only\u00a0half of eighth\u00a0graders scored \"at or above basic\" and only a quarter \"at or above proficient\" in math.\nAs I write in my book,\u00a0\"The Ten Woke Commandments (You Must Not Obey),\" U.S. K-12 education\u00a0has gone from world-beating to self-defeating, thanks to a combination of bad teaching methods, low standards and individual failure.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nMarxist educational ideology looks at every failing grade as evidence of systemic racism, rather than lack of application or poor teaching. Instead of doing what works \u2013 banning phones, keeping discipline, maintaining grade and test standards, and working longer and\u00a0harder \u2013 they look to fads like \"culturally-responsive\" teaching, \"living mathematx\" (\"a new form of mathematics where\u00a0humans are no longer centered\"), and \"Nepantla.\" That, \"employed in a \u2018mathematx\u2019 context,\" means a kid can get the answer wrong and the teacher can grade it right.\nForeign investment in the U.S. can be a win/win, but only on fair terms. To avoid moreHyundaidebacles, we need two things.\nFirst, we should not let American or foreign companies import cheap labor to compete with our own graduates and workers. Other than perhaps a few managers, technical specialists and native language speakers, companies like\u00a0Hyundai can recruit most of their American workforce\u00a0here in the U.S.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSecond, U.S. states\u00a0have to get serious about fixing theireducation systemsand train kids for the jobs of today and tomorrow.\nNo more excuses, nonsense and Nepantla \u2013 just the basics, and fast.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SIMON HANKINSON\nSimon Hankinson is a senior research fellow in The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Border Security and Immigration Center and author of\"The Ten Woke Commandments (You Must Not Obey)\"from Academica Books.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/5-things-explain-hyundai-immigration-debacle"}

Icon's builds include entire neighborhoods of single-story housesin Austin, as well as experimental multi-level projects. However, most of Icon's multi-story designs rely on a hybrid approach, with 3D printing for the ground floor and timber or steel frames for the upper levels.\nThat's what makes the Tapping project stand out. Contec printed the structural walls for both stories in just 18 hours of active printing time, something not yet widely seen in the U.S. This could signal the next step for American 3D printing: scaling beyond single-story housing into more complex multi-story designs.\nBRICKS MADE FROM RECYCLED COFFEE GROUNDS REDUCE EMISSIONS AND COSTS\nBedroom of a multi-story 3D concrete printed home located in Tapping, Australia.(Contec Australia)\nOne of the biggest questions people have is price. Contec hasn't shared the exact cost of the Tapping home, but the company says it delivered the structural walls 22% cheaper than a standard masonry build. That saving adds up when you consider how much of a home's budget goes toward labor and materials.\nIn the U.S., companies like Icon have priced 3D printed homes starting around $100,000 to $150,000, depending on size and finishes.

Meanwhile,\u00a0the\u00a0current administration targets deporting one\u00a0million\u00a0people annually, a figure\u00a0not included\u00a0in Census projections that assumestable immigration.\nLike Birkin bags,\u00a0the\u00a0real\u00a0problem\u00a0isn\u2019t supply, it\u2019s that people want exclusive neighborhoods, and no amount\u00a0of\u00a0construction changes that\u00a0reality.

It\u2019s why Washington,\u00a0D.C., which bans skyscrapers, doesn\u2019t look like Manhattan.\nNew York City\u2019s Economic Development Corporation exemplifies this approach, scolding neighborhoods like\u00a0the\u00a0Upper East Side, SoHo and\u00a0the\u00a0West Village for\u00a0\"restrictive\u00a0land use regulations\"\u00a0that limit density.\u00a0They explicitly note that\u00a0\"Community Districts producing\u00a0the\u00a0least affordable\u00a0housing\u00a0are disproportionately white.\"\u00a0Their demographic focus reveals\u00a0the\u00a0true agenda.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe\u00a0Obama administration weaponized this logic through HUD\u2019s Affirmatively Furthering Fair\u00a0Housing\u00a0rule, forcing towns that accepted federal funding to eliminate zoning laws and to provide detailed reports on racial demographics.\u00a0The\u00a0effort had an important political dimension. By forcing high-density, low-income\u00a0housing\u00a0into suburban communities, activists aimed to flip red areas blue.\nPresident Trump recognized\u00a0the\u00a0stakes in his first term, and tasked a White House team led by John McEntee to eliminate\u00a0the\u00a0rule, which\u00a0they did in\u00a014 days. Biden reinstated it, but HUD SecretaryScott Turnerwisely eliminated it again soon after taking\u00a0office.\nUnfortunately, some Republicans and Libertarians have fallen for\u00a0the\u00a0housing\u00a0shortage hoax and still don\u2019t\u00a0realize that eliminating sensible neighborhood standards like zoning are a stalking horse for imposing\u00a0DEI\u00a0quotas.

But that show of force is not the only threat posed by today\u2019s axis of evil.\nEqually alarming is the insidious attack by China and its allies on theU.S. dollar, ringing alarms across global financial markets. China and other central banks have been stockpiling gold, diversifying their reserves away from U.S. government bonds, driving gold prices higher and Treasury yields up. Their allies have followed suit.\nDoes it matter to most Americans? Yes. A weaker dollar means traveling abroad and imported goods are more expensive, even without tariffs. Higher interest rates inflate borrowing costs.\nGOLD MIGHT GLITTER, BUT IT'S STILL MONEY. TAXES SHOULD TREAT IT THAT WAY\nMorgan Stanley reports, \"The value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies dropped about 11% in the first half of this year, the biggest decline in more than 50 years, ending a 15-year bull cycle.\" The investment bank, writing last month, also noted that, \"The U.S. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973,\" and predicts more deterioration over the next 12 months.\nWhile the dollar has been dropping, gold prices have surged. The Comex price for September delivery recently topped $3,600 per ounce, an all-time high. The price is up 45% over the past year.\nIn June, J.P. Morgan analysts predicted that gold prices would move higher in large part because of continued purchases by central banks. They wrote, \"Gold holdings by central banks amount to nearly 36,200 tonnes and account for almost 20% of official reserves, up from around 15% at the end of 2023, according to reported IMF data through the end of 2024.\"\nCHINA'S CENTRAL BANK CALLS ON STATE BANKS TO REDUCE US DOLLAR PURCHASES\n\"Diversification away from U.S. dollar reserve holdings, while still moderate, has been accelerating in recent years\u2026 The U.S. dollar share ended the year at around 57.8%, marking a 0.62 percentage point decline.\"\nNot all central banks have participated in the recent gold-buying spree. J.P.

To undermine the U.S. currency \u2014 and the U.S. itself. Beijing is pressing hard to dethrone the dollar and promote widespread adoption of the renminbi as the world\u2019s reserve currency.\nThat is not going to happen any time soon, given Beijing\u2019s currency manipulation, lack of reliable economic data and faltering economy. But raising doubts about the dollar\u2019s strength serves China\u2019s purpose, reducing investor appetite for dollar-denominated Treasuries. That forces the U.S. government to pay higher interest rates to attract buyers \u2014 a scenario already playing out.\nCOULD THE US DOLLAR LOSE ITS RESERVE CURRENCY STATUS TO CHINA?\nThe anti-Trump media has aided China\u2019s cause with incessant alarmism about President Trump\u2019s economic policies, especially his tariff program.

When a lower court ruled Trump\u2019s tariffs illegal last week, even critics admitted tariff revenues were substantial, valuable and would help reverse some of the damage from Joe Biden\u2019s spending spree.\nNeither China nor the liberal media will break the U.S. dollar or the economy.

Starting in fiscal year 2026, any tariff money collected above the 2025 baseline level would automatically go into this fund. By law, that money could only be spent in one way: to shrink the federal deficit whenever the government is running in the red.\n\"President Trump\u2019s bold use of tariffs has already proven effective in bringing foreign nations back to the negotiating table and securing better trade deals for America.

He is ending the chaos in our capital, restoring beauty to the city and making the district safer for all Americans.\nThe president\u2019s commonsense policy has also exposed the depth of misguided anger toward our men and women in uniform, with the most recent example being the bitterness shown by activists against theNational Guard. Unfortunately, this hostility toward those who defend against lawlessness goes beyond street mobs harassing the brave men and women fighting crime.\nIn 2024, the Biden administration published a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Continuum of Care (CoC) program, which was designed to fund organizations working to address homelessness. We quickly found that, like many department programs, this one had strayed from its original intent, becoming a mismanaged slush fund that enabled endless government-supported homelessness rather than delivering real solutions.\nMembers of federal law enforcement walk past a homeless woman outside of New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., Aug. 14, 2025.(Reuters/Nathan Howard)\nWhat we uncovered exposes the severity of the waste, fraud and abuse under the Biden administration, as well as its disdain forlaw enforcement. The NOFO revealed an administration that prioritized awarding HUD funds to groups that refused to helpfully cooperate with law enforcement.\nHERE'S WHY HELPING THE HOMELESS REBUILD THEIR LIVES IS KEY TO AMERICA\u2019S FUTURE SUCCESS\nBiden\u2019s HUD rewarded groups that \"\u2026minimize(d) use of law enforcement to enforce bans on public sleeping, public camping, or carrying out basic life functions in public places.\"\nThat policy was rooted in a worldview that treats law enforcement as the enemy. From the \"defund the police\" rhetoric to \"don\u2019t work with the police\" policies, this animosity toward those who enforce the law has become deeply embedded in the Democratic Party.\nBut let\u2019s be clear: the real enemy when it comes to helping Americans living on the street is not those who risk their lives to uphold law and order, it is the cycle of endless government handouts thatbankroll homelessnesswhile ignoring its root causes.\nThose root causes are addiction and untreated mental illness. And they\u2019re on full display in our cities. Sprawling encampments, public drug use andrandom violent attackswreak havoc in the major cities Americans call home. Every day, overdoses claim lives and the most vulnerable fall victim to violence.\nTHE LEFT'S HOMELESS PLANS WRECKED OUR CITIES. NOW HELP MAY COME FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE\nThis status quo is unacceptable. That\u2019s why HUD is driving a paradigm shift to end this crisis.\nAt HUD, our responsibility is both to the most vulnerable Americans and to taxpayers whose hard-earned dollars we\u2019re entrusted to steward. No one should suffer on our streets, and no one should walk them in fear.\nThe Biden administration spent four years denying the commonsense reality that street-level homelessness is a public safety crisis driven by addiction and mental illness. During that time, more than $12 billion of working Americans\u2019 taxpayer dollars was funneled into the CoC program with nothing but record high rates of homelessness to show. In cities like Los Angeles and New York, billions more in local resources have been wasted.\nHow did we get here? Through failed leadership that demanded blind fealty to \"Housing First\" \u2013 an ideology that promotes fully subsidized housing, forever, with zero strings attached.\nI\u2019M A BLUE STATE MAYOR AND THE FUTURE OF HOMELESSNESS SCARES ME\nBut our goal is to let HUD use real, proven effective strategies, and there is no evidence that giving free apartments to the homeless without preconditions or participation requirements \u2013 like job training or treatment \u2013 leads to good outcomes.\nThere\u00a0isevidence, however, that countless lives have been lost to overdoses in HUD-funded housing because of this failed ideology.\nAccording to HUD\u2019s most recent data, residents were twice as likely to die in \"permanent supportive housing\" for the homeless than to move into unsubsidized housing, and the death rate of heads of households in these units went up by almost a third from 2019-2022. Local governments report that they\u2019re more likely to lose people to overdoses in isolatedsubsidized housingand hotel rooms than outside on the streets.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAnother tragic failure of progressivism\u2019s response to homelessness has been the systematic exclusion of faith-based organizations. That policy changed when Americans elected President Trump, because this administration recognizes that the very first organizations to serve the homeless in this nation were Christian ministries \u2013 and that they continue to be core partners in this mission to this day.\nI\u2019ve walked the halls of shelter programs, transitional housing, and recovery centers where life transformation happens every day because of the faith of the men and women who serve there, who clothe, feed and care for those made in God\u2019s image.

FIXING THEM SHOULD BE JOB NO. 1 FOR AMERICA\nHere\u2019s the stunning problem. Although both ships and chips sectors are booming with urgent programs and new opportunities, America as a nation has devalued the trades and is paying the price. Themanufacturing sector'sworkforce decline due to decades of globalism has been so sharp that U.S. national security and economic dominance are at risk.\nJust 3% of the American population today work in manufacturing, versus 9% during the Cold War. COVID-19 hit hard.

During the pandemic, when unions demanded that schools close and classes went online, parents saw firsthand the woke garbage being taught to their kids. Something broke.\nLINDA MCMAHON PULLS BACK THE CURTAIN ON TRUMP'S PLAN TO DISMANTLE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nWith AI rocketing into reality and infusing every industry with the possibility of enormous productivity gains, the time has come to combat the rigid authoritarianism of the teachers unions.Trump should lead that charge.\nIn New York City, the nonprofit Citizens Budget Commission estimates that the Department of Education will spendmore than $42,000 per childthis year, more than any other big city in the country and one-third more than was spent just five years ago.\nAnd what do families in the Big Apple get for that outrageous sum, which accounts for nearly one third of the city\u2019s budget?

Today's solar companies are turning to flocks of sheep to trim grass and control weeds under solar panels. These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time. In fact, using sheep instead of gas-powered mowing crews can reduce upkeep expenses by up to 20 percent.\nSign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox.

They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reducecarbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.\nWHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE JOINING A POWER SAVER PROGRAM\nSheep graze near solar panels in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024.(REUTERS/Annie Rice)\nThis isn't your average landscaping story. There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy productionwith agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.\nChad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.\nLetting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.\nCompanies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't justpower generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.\nGOOGLE TURNS CO2 INTO BATTERY POWER FOR CLEAN ENERGY\nSheep grazing cuts operations and maintenance costs for solar operators.(REUTERS/Annie Rice)\nThis isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.\nAt some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.\nInvestors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.\nChad Raines opens the gate to a solar panel zone in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024. This solar farm has six different solar panel zones on 1,800 acres of land.(REUTERS/Annie Rice)\nIf you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.\nFor everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fightclimate change, all at once.

{"title": "From Teddy Roosevelt to Reagan to Trump, presidents have warned of power-hungry public-sector unions", "date": "2025-09-01", "body": "Parents Defending Education researcher Rhyen Staley sounds off on a report finding that America's two largest teachers' unions have funneled nearly $50 million to left-wing groups since 2022.\nPresidentDonald Trumprecently canceled public-employee union contracts for thousands of federal workers. The employees worked in agencies tied to national security, allowing Trump to invoke a national security exemption to the normal rules governing federal employees. Trump\u2019s decision builds on his March executive order expanding the agencies covered by the exemption.\nIt is the latest step in a series of battles over public-sector unionism at the federal level that goes back more than a century \u2014 a debate that touches on key aspects of democratic governance.\nIn 1902, PresidentTheodore \"Teddy\" Rooseveltissued an order barring federal workers and postal employees from lobbying Congress. His successor, William Howard Taft, took a similar action in 1909 with Executive Order 1142, which focused on preventing lobbying by members of the military. Congress overturned these orders in 1912 with the Lloyd-La Follette Act, but the move did not lead to widespread public-sector unionism.\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt (1858\u20131919) succeeded William McKinley after his assassination. Roosevelt was the first American to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded for his mediation in the Russo-Japanese war.(Topical Press Agency/Getty Images)\nIn 1919, Massachusetts Gov. Calvin Coolidge put himself on the political map when he fired striking Boston police officers. When he made this decision, Coolidge famously declared: \"There is no right to strike against the public safety, anywhere, anytime.\" Coolidge\u2019s action was an important factor in Warren Harding choosing Coolidge as his vice presidential nominee in 1920.\nFEDERAL JUDGE RULES AGAINST TRUMP ADMIN IN LAWSUIT AGAINST GOVERNMENT LABOR UNIONS\nThe Harding-Coolidge ticket defeated Ohio Gov. James Cox and New York\u2019s Franklin Roosevelt. Coolidge became president when Harding died in 1923. Roosevelt eventually made it to the White House in 1932. But as president, Roosevelt recognized the dangers of public-sector unionism and opposed it. The 1935 Wagner Act, which boosted the power of private-sector unions, specifically exempted public-sector unions from its protections, stating that federal, state and local governments were not to be considered \"employers\" with the same obligations Wagner imposed on the private sector.\nIn 1937, Roosevelt wrote a pivotal letter to the president of the Federation of Federal Employees. According to Roosevelt: \"All government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service.\"\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivers one of his fireside chat radio broadcasts in this 1930s photo.(Stock Montage/Getty Images)\nRoosevelt\u2019s reasoning was crystal clear and has been frequently cited by conservatives \u2014 and conveniently ignored by liberals. He warned: \"The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations.\"\nTRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL PLAN TO FIRE FEDERAL WORKERS FINDS FAVOR WITH SUPREME COURT\nIn 1939, the Hatch Act included language limiting political activity by public-sector workers. The act, passed by a Democratic Congress under a Democratic president, stemmed from concerns about political activity by employees at Roosevelt\u2019s Works Progress Administration during the 1936 election. Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins, director of the WPA, had been accused of promising jobs for votes, leading to congressional outcry and the passage of the law.\nA big change toward the acceptance of public-sector unions came during the John F. Kennedy administration. In 1962, Kennedy issued Executive Order 10988, explicitly allowing federal employees to form unions and bargain collectively. But as Ira Stoll points out in his book \"JFK, Conservative,\" Kennedy also recognized important limitations. His order did not include the words \"collective bargaining.\"\nJohn F. Kennedy (1917-1963), the 35th president of the United States, relaxes in his trademark rocking chair in the Oval Office.(Getty Images)\nHe understood, like FDR, the inherent conflict of interest in granting those rights to government employees. In addition, the order said the government should not recognize any union \"which asserts the right to strike against the government of the United States or any agency thereof\u2026 or which advocates the overthrow of the constitutional form of the government in the United States.\"\nThis language showed disapproval of strikes by public-sector unions and concerns about communist influence. Kennedy also exempted the FBI and CIA from public-sector unionism because of national security concerns \u2014 a precursor to Trump\u2019s recent actions.\nIf there was one president who did the most to promote public-sector unionism in the federal government, it wasJimmy Carter. Public-sector unionism had already been rising at the local level when Carter was elected in 1976. Recognizing this trend, Victor Gotbaum, head of New York\u2019s American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), bragged in 1975, \"We have the power, in a sense, to elect our own boss.\"\nPresident Jimmy Carter addressing a town meeting.\nWhen Carter signed the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act, he expanded union power at the federal level. The law granted most federal employees the right to join unions and bargain over the \"conditions of [their] employment.\" Even though it included a national security exemption, the CSRA was a major step toward the current era in which, according to Philip Howard\u2019s 2023 book \"Not Accountable,\" \"the abuse of power by public employee unions is the main story of public failure in America \u2014 worse even, I believe, than polarization or red tape.\"\nCarter also created the Department of Education, long sought by teachers' unions. They have been paying back Democrats ever since. A new report shows the top two teachers' unions have given almost $50 million to left-wing groups since 2022.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nCarter\u2019s successor,Ronald Reagan, pushed back in August 1981 when he fired 11,345 illegally striking air traffic controllers. Reagan issued a statement he wrote himself: \"We cannot compare labor-management relations in the private sector with government. Government cannot close down the assembly line. It has to provide without interruption the protective services which are government\u2019s reason for being.\u2026 Those who fail to report for duty\u2026 are in violation of the law, and if they do not report for work within 48 hours, they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated.\"\nReagan\u2019s move had far-reaching implications. It showed the Soviets he was a man of his word, helped him maneuver more effectively on the world stage and boosted his political standing at home. Most importantly, it demonstrated that the federal government could limit the right of federal employees to strike. There had been two dozen strikes by federal workers in the two decades before Reagan\u2019s action. There have been none since.\nPresident Ronald Reagan walking and giving a thumbs-up gesture on the South Lawn of the White House after returning from Massachusetts.(Cynthia Johnson/Getty Images)\nSince then, political organizing \u2014 not striking \u2014 has been the main battleground for public-sector unions. They overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates, using dues to fund campaigns.\nIn 1988, theSupreme Courtin Communications Workers v. Beck required unions to give workers the ability to opt out of the portion of mandatory dues spent on politics. In April 1992, in the midst of a tough re-election campaign, PresidentGeorge H.W. Bushissued an executive order implementing Beck by requiring federal contractors to notify employees of their Beck rights. Bush said: \"Full implementation\u2026 will guarantee that no American will have his job or livelihood threatened for refusing to contribute to political activities against his will.\"\nBill Clinton, Bush\u2019s Democratic opponent, denounced the order on the campaign trail. According to a Bush White House estimate, if every eligible worker requested a refund, union funds for campaign activities would be reduced by $2.4 billion \u2014 nearly all of it aiding Democrats. As president, Clinton revoked the order. When George W. Bush took office, he reinstated it, showing how partisan the issue had become.\nPresident Bill Clinton in the Oval Office.(Pool/Getty Images)\nAnother key fight has been over the scope of public-sector union coverage. During the creation of the Department of Homeland Security after the 9/11 attacks, George W. Bush sought to exempt DHS employees from union requirements. He won legislatively, but court decisions later limited many of those exemptions. Trump\u2019s recent actions echo that battle as he seeks to extend exemptions to agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs. Courts will decide whether his moves fall within the law.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nLooking back, presidents as different as Theodore Roosevelt, Coolidge, Franklin Roosevelt, Kennedy, Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Trump all agreed on one thing: limiting the scope of public-sector unions, especially in national security. Unfortunately, today the issue is highly partisan, with Democrats staunchly in favor of public-sector unions and Republicans looking to curtail their power.\nOn this Labor Day, we should celebrate American workers while recognizing the difference between hardworking citizens and public-sector unions that use their power to elect their own bosses.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TEVI TROY\nTevi Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute and a former senior White House aide.

From the Federal Reserve to trade policy to deportations of illegal immigrants, here's a look at the high-stakes legal showdowns shaping Trump\u2019s week.\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, aBidenappointee, signaled on Friday she will seek to rule quickly on whether Trump acted unlawfully in moving to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations. She didn\u2019t make a rulingduring the two-hour hearingbut told both sides to submit more filings by Sept 2.

Her lawsuit names as defendants Trump, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Reserve ChairmanJerome Powell.\nIt is not clear if Cook has attempted to enter the Federal Reserve's main headquarters in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood in D.C. since Trump's letter terminating her. TheFederal Reservedeclined to say whether Cook has tried to work from her office, is working remotely, or retains access to the email and other resources she needs for her job.\nBefore Cook filed her suit, a Fed spokesperson acknowledged the potential legal feud and wrote in an Aug. 26 statement that the Fed will \"abide by any court decision.\"\nCOOK\u2019S POTENTIAL EXIT HANDS TRUMP GREATER SWAY OVER FED BOARD SHAPING US MONETARY POLICY\nIn a different legal case, Judge Cobb issued a temporary order preventing the Trump administration from carrying out expedited deportations of illegal immigrants. The policy would have allowed some to be deported without first going before an immigration judge.\nIn an Aug. 29 opinion, Cobb ruled that the Trump administration\u2019s plan to quickly deportillegal immigrantswho had lived in the U.S. less than two years violated their right to due process.\n\"In defending this skimpy process, the government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment,\" Cobb wrote, adding that the government could accuse \"not only noncitizens, but everyone.\"\n\"The government could accuse you of entering unlawfully, relegate you to a bare-bones proceeding where it would \u2018prove\u2019 your unlawful entry, and then immediately remove you,\" Cobb added.\nFEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S EXPANDED DEPORTATION PLAN OVER DUE PROCESS CONCERNS\nMeanwhile, on the trade front, a federal appeals court said on Friday that Trump overstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose newtariffson imported goods.\nThe court said that power lies squarely with Congress or within existing trade policy frameworks. Attorney GeneralPam Bondisaid the Justice Department will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the court allowed the tariffs to remain in effect until mid-October.\nTRUMP CALLS TARIFF WINDFALL 'SO BEAUTIFUL TO SEE' AS CASH SAILS IN\nA ferry passes container ships docked at the Port of Oakland on Aug. 1, 2025, in California.(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\nThe setback chips away at Trump\u2019s trade policy, long a centerpiece of his economic agenda, which leans heavily on tariffs to raise revenue and exert pressure on foreign trading partners.

Instead of focusing on the workers they claim to represent, union officials wield political clout to protect and expand their privileged positions.\nThis is becausetoday\u2019s unionsare built on the government-authorized ability to compel workers into their ranks. In the 24 states without\u00a0right-to-work\u00a0laws, union chiefs can legally extort private sector workers to \"pay up or be fired.\" Even when union membership is voluntary, workers must accept the union bargaining collectively for their wages and working conditions.\nNATION\u2019S 2 LARGEST TEACHERS UNIONS FUNNELED NEARLY $50M TO LEFT-WING GROUPS, WATCHDOG REPORT SAYS\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that you, as an individual employee, may not want the union\u2019s so-called representation or a one-size-fits-all contract; union bureaucrats can forcibly take your dues money, then use it to buy political influence or advocate causes you oppose.\nWorkers do still have some limited rights guaranteed under federal law, such as the right to have union dues not pay for political activities (CWA v. Beck, 1988) or the right of public employees not to be forced to pay any money to a government union (Janus v. AFSCME, 2018). But, union political operatives are using their influence \u2014 bought with workers\u2019 dues money collected under duress \u2014 to try to push through a legislative agenda that upends these rights.\nFor example, the\u00a0Protecting the Right to Work Act (PRO Act), Big Labor\u2019s top legislative priority in Congress, would repeal all current 26 state Right to Work laws by federal fiat. Even though Right to Work laws don\u2019t stop a single worker from joining a union or paying dues voluntarily, they\u2019ve made it their signature move to end this protection for good.\nWhy? Becauseunion bosseswant to strip rank-and-file workers of their choice. This becomes all the more obvious as you examine the PRO Act\u2019s other provisions, which codify several suspect or downright illegal tactics union enforcers already use to get around workers\u2019 rights.\nOne such tactic is the controversial \"card check\" method of organizing a union, which avoids the traditional secret ballot that lets workers have the final say. Instead, this process lets organizers submit union cards collected in person from workers, often using pressure or intimidation tactics. The AFL-CIO even\u00a0admitted\u00a0in its own organizing handbook that such cards don\u2019t reflect workers\u2019 actual wishes.\nTo protectexisting unionsfrom decertification (secret-ballot votes to remove an incumbent union), the PRO Act codifies another common Big Labor tactic. Through union-filed blocking charges \u2014 unproven allegations against the company of unfair practices \u2014 union officials can unilaterally block decertification votes for months or more.\nIn multiple cases, such tactics were used to block decertification votes from occurring even though\u00a0100% of workers\u00a0signed the decertification petition. Workers can literally be unanimously opposed to the union, yet union officials can manipulate their special legal powers to trap workers against their will.\nIt\u2019s the latest sign that today\u2019s union officials have fully rejected the warnings of some early union officials who wanted to build their organizations without coercing workers into their ranks.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nTake Samuel Gompers, the founder of the American Federation of Labor (now the AFL-CIO). In a 1924\u00a0speech\u00a0to union delegates he forcefully rejected the coercion today\u2019s union bosses rely on: \"I want to urge devotion to the fundamentals of human liberty \u2014 the principles of voluntarism. No lasting gain has ever come from compulsion.\"\nGompers understood, as do the 8 in 10 Americans who oppose forced union dues and affiliation, that when union affiliation and financial support are voluntary, union officials must prove their worth to individual workers. But today, union bossesincreasingly reject this ideal, and undermine the liberty of those they claim to \"represent.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSo this Labor Day, remember that truly being \"pro-worker\" means rejecting the propaganda from union bosses and respecting a worker\u2019s right to choose whether they want to join a union.\nAfter all, it\u2019s Labor Day, not Union Day.\nMark Mix is the president of the National Right to Work Committee and National Right to Work Foundation.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/celebrate-american-workers-not-union-bosses-labor-day"}

Prosperity is on the horizon, with real median weekly earnings at their highest level since the last time PresidentDonald Trumpwas in office.\nWe are doing what it takes to ensure that as new, mortgage-paying jobs are being created, skilled workers are ready and able to fill them. Putting native-born workers first in that effort, we\u2019ve already witnessed an increase in native-born employment by 2,462,000 since January.\nTo keep driving this progress, President Trump tasked the Labor Department with a mission to Make America Skilled Again. That\u2019s the drum I\u2019m going to keep beating. It will require time and effort, but it\u2019s going to yield dividends for our workers and their families.\nAs we create new opportunities for theAmerican worker, I\u2019ve been on the ground, talking to folks around the country whose lives inform our policies. I\u2019m finding out what they need at the federal level and how we can best serve them in Washington.\nARE PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S TARIFFS ACTUALLY WORKING?\nI\u2019m over halfway through my 50-state America at Work tour, and a recurring theme has been workforce readiness \u2013 ensuring our labor force is prepared and trained for the challenges of tomorrow. From decades of political neglect, the American worker was placed on the back burner and their best interests were ignored.\nNow, the Trump administration is turning that around, placing our workers at the pinnacle of oureconomic vision. We\u2019re reigniting the Made in America spirit that defined the founding of our country.\nAt a little over 200 days into President Trump\u2019s incredible second term, we\u2019ve seen the economy rapidly responding to better trade deals and sound labor policy \u2013 especially in the private sector. There has been more than $8 trillion in domestic investments, which led to half a million private sector jobs being created since Inauguration Day.\nBlue-collar wages have also increased 1.4% over last year \u2013 the second-fastest increase for the start of a new term on record. Even better, instead of inflation outpacing wages, as it did underPresident Joe Bidenfor 26 straight months, real wages have increased every single month since President Trump returned to office.\nTRUMP'S MAJOR TRADE WINS COULD BE ROCKET FUEL TO US ECONOMY\nAnd we\u2019re just getting started.\nWith this expectation-shattering job and wage growth, I\u2019m teaming up with my colleagues across the administration to keep the red-hot economy going strong. The Departments ofLabor, Commerce and Educationjoined together to create a five-pillar plan called America\u2019s Talent Strategy. This comprehensive strategy will help us expand access to good-paying jobs, build skilled talent pipelines for critical industries, equip the workforce with artificial intelligence skills, and reposition the U.S. as the global economic leader.\nTo bring further relief to hardworking families, I\u2019m determined to get heavy-handed government out of their pockets. At the Department of Labor, we announced a historic 63 deregulatory actions to do just that. We\u2019re slashing red tape and making it easier for workers to keep more of their hard-earned money.\nMy team also announced $30 million in grant opportunities through the Industry-Driven Skills Training Fund. This money is going to accelerate workforce innovation and address critical labor needs across the country, giving a financial boost right to the people who need it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' WILL UNLEASH PARALLEL PROSPERITY\nWhat\u2019s more, our future will not be forged in the halls of woke universities, but by the grit of skilled workers, so I\u2019m coordinating with the Department of Education and working with states to expose even more students to the trades and provide a springboard into the workforce that doesn\u2019t rely on a traditional four-year degree. Trade school enrollment has already reached the highest level ever recorded, and we\u2019re going to make sure it keeps going up.\nIn keeping with these goals, the president signed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, expanding Pell Grants to students pursuing technical education and skills training. Not only is this law of the land going to unlock even more opportunities for future tradesmen and women, but it will also add thousands of dollars to every single worker\u2019s paycheck through historic tax cuts.\nBetween the unlocked Pell Grant opportunities and the president\u2019s directive to recruit more apprentices, it\u2019s crystal clear \u2013 we\u2019re on our way to creating one million new active apprenticeships nationwide. Since January alone, the Department of Labor recorded 1,736 new registered apprenticeship programs launched nationally and over 183,000 new apprentices.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nOn this Labor Day, and every day, we recognize the impact of our apprentices, tradesmen, blue collar workers and small business owners.

But this year, in the wake of growing\u00a0economic inequality\u00a0and a\u00a0government increasingly catering to billionaires and special interests,\u00a0Labor\u00a0Day\u00a0needs to be more than a long holiday weekend. It must be the impetus of a battle cry\u00a0for\u00a0workers everywhere to rise up, realize their collective strength and take their\u00a0power\u00a0back.\nHedge fund managers and tech moguls did not build this country or the American middle class. It was technicians, engineers, installers, teachers, caregivers, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, ironworkers, painters,\u00a0laborers, operators, mechanics, drivers, farmworkers, clerks, grocers and so many others.\nThey went to work each\u00a0day\u00a0\u2013 often invisible and without fair pay, benefits, or even basic dignity. They risked their jobs, their safety and sometimes their lives tosecure better working conditionswe all enjoy today, like an eight-hour workday, overtime pay and the right to organize.\nA sign at a May Day rally for worker and immigrant rights at the Capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota. (Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\nI\u2019ve spent my career enforcing\u00a0labor\u00a0law and fighting to protect\u00a0workers\u2019 rights. I\u2019ve seen how\u00a0powerful working people can be when they come together. The bosses and billionaires see it, too \u2013 and it terrifies them. That\u2019s why they\u2019re working hard in Washington to rig the system, spending millions to weaken\u00a0worker\u00a0protections and make it harder\u00a0for\u00a0workers to exercise their rights to unionize, collectively bargain and mobilize to improve their working conditions, and to enjoy their freedoms of speech, assembly, association and expression.\nARE YOU BETTER OFF SINCE DONALD TRUMP TOOK OFFICE?\nToday, we\u2019re living through one of the largest transfers of wealth in modern history. Working people andfamilies juggle multiple jobswhile corporations pop champagne over record profits and billionaires buy second yachts.\u00a0Recent estimates\u00a0show the Republican budget bill will only deepen this disparity, by taking away Medicaid and SNAP assistance from millions of Americans to pay\u00a0for\u00a0tax cuts\u00a0for\u00a0the super wealthy that they really don\u2019t need and didn\u2019t earn. They\u2019re profiting off the backs of so many hard-working people.\nThis is not an accident. It\u2019s the direct result of a system where corporations and their donors have an\u00a0outsized voice and direct influence on our democracy\u00a0\u2013 and politicians showering them with loopholes and special treatment.\u00a0For\u00a0example, President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0Labor\u00a0Department\u00a0recently announced\u00a0they were rolling back 60 workplace regulations, putting\u00a0workers at greater risk of being hurt while making it easier\u00a0for\u00a0employers to get away with it.\nSimilarly, the National\u00a0Labor\u00a0Relations Board (NLRB)\u00a0remains without a quorum, rendering it impossible to issue rulings or make decisions that hold corporations accountable\u00a0for\u00a0breaking the law. My fear is that, if this continues, we\u2019ll find ourselves living in an environment reflective of what it was like before 1935\u2019s National\u00a0Labor\u00a0Relations Act: lower wages, substandard working conditions and no real channels\u00a0for\u00a0workers to fight back.\nDON'T BE FOOLED. MAMDANI ISN'T THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THESE TWO PATRIOTIC WOMEN ARE\nBillionaires and corporations hope this will make\u00a0workers feel defeated. We can\u2019t let that happen because the truth is \u2013\u00a0workers aren\u2019t\u00a0powerless. To the contrary, they have tremendous\u00a0power.\nLet\u2019s remember our history. From the Boston Tea Party to women\u2019s suffrage to the Civil Rights Movement to the strikes at the turn of the 20th century,\u00a0workers have always been a catalyst\u00a0for\u00a0change. Protests, boycotts, picketing, strikes, sit-ins, non-cooperation \u2013 these have never been signs of violence or dysfunction. They\u2019reexpressions of democracy.\nOur present moment in history is no different \u2013 and\u00a0workers must realize they have tools to begin reclaiming this country and their\u00a0power\u00a0to demand changes to the way they\u2019re governed and how they live their lives.\nWE HAVE A GOVERNMENT OF BILLIONAIRES, BY BILLIONAIRES AND FOR BILLIONAIRES\nSupport\u00a0for\u00a0unions\u00a0has skyrocketed to its highest point in generations, especially\u00a0among young people. They\u2019re organizing at coffee shops, warehouses, grocery stores, newspapers, universities, airlines, hospitals, tech campuses and many other locations because they realize the\u00a0power\u00a0they hold through standing together and bargaining collectively.\nThey\u2019re rightfully demanding more than just survival \u2013 they\u2019re demanding respect. They\u2019re standing strong in the face of union-busting campaigns, retaliatory firings and illegal threats because they know what\u2019s at stake \u2013 not just\u00a0for\u00a0themselves, but\u00a0for\u00a0their families and their communities. There\u2019s strength in numbers.\nThat\u2019s what gives me hope because collective\u00a0power\u00a0is stronger than individual\u00a0power. We\u2019re seeing agroundswell of organizingin places once thought impossible to organize, especially when people feel their elected representatives aren\u2019t listening to them. This creates enormous opportunities\u00a0for\u00a0unions, advocates and allies to rally around\u00a0workers, listen to their challenges, and build grassroots momentum to help\u00a0workers obtain a more level playing field and safer, more just and inclusive workplaces.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIn my experience, billionaires and corporations don\u2019t provide\u00a0workers with a fair and equitable workplace through an act of goodwill. They will provide it, however, when\u00a0workers demand it loudly, boldly, and persistently and show their collective\u00a0power. This means withholding\u00a0labor, engaging in non-cooperation, organizing sit-ins and taking other\u00a0forms of collective action. It\u2019s time\u00a0for\u00a0workers to use this\u00a0power\u00a0to protest about injustices and inequities, to make sure laws are fully enforced, and to vote out elected officials\u00a0for\u00a0not representing their interests.\nLabor\u00a0Day\u00a0was bornout of strikes and marches from those who came before us. It exists because\u00a0workers refused to be taken advantage of and exploited. That legacy is now in our hands \u2013 to honor, not just with celebration, but with resolve and action.\u00a0Workers must never\u00a0forget the\u00a0power\u00a0they have to fight together\u00a0for\u00a0the dignity, security and respect they\u2019re entitled to and so richly deserve.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nJennifer Abruzzo\u00a0is a former general counsel at the National\u00a0Labor\u00a0Relations Board.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/labor-day-battle-cry-billionaires-didnt-build-country-workers-did-theyll-take-back"}

Those who embrace AI tools now can work faster, free up time for creative thinking, and make themselves even more valuable.\nIf your role is on the \"least impacted\" list, don't assume you're immune forever. While physical and hands-on jobs have less overlap with AI today,future technologiesbeyond language models, like robotics or AI-driven machinery, could change that picture. Staying adaptable, learning basic AI skills, and keeping up with tech trends will help you stay ahead no matter your industry.\nIn short, treat this study as a career weather forecast, not a doomsday prediction.

And even that\u00a0one-time bump may be negligible if, as we have long argued, foreign exporters \u2013 not American consumers \u2013 shoulder most or all of the burden.\nThe implication is clear: whether the impact is zero or merely a\u00a0one-time step-up in prices, there is absolutelyno justification for the Fedto hide behind \"tariff\u00a0uncertainty\" as an excuse for overly restrictive interest-rate policy.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell walks off following a news conference, May 7, 2025, at the Federal Reserve in Washington.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\nThis really is a historic\u00a0epiphany\u00a0from a Fed chair who has long misunderstood the power of\u00a0Trumpnomics\u00a0\u2013 the four beautiful horsemen of economic growth and price stability:\u00a0tax cuts, deregulation, strategic energy dominance and fair trade.\nTHE FED\u2019S FOOLISH INTEREST RATE POLICY IS STOPPING AMERICA\u2019S ECONOMY FROM BOOMING\nTrumpnomics deliveredboth strong economic growth\u00a0and\u00a0price stability in the first term.

The Dow\u00a0smashed through its 45,000 ceiling\u00a0\u2013 and I remain\u00a0on\u00a0record predicting a march to 50,000. Yields\u00a0on\u00a0the 10- and 30-year Treasuries\u00a0tumbled, driving bond prices sharply higher.\nClearly, Wall Street got\u00a0Powell\u2019s dovish\u00a0tariff\u00a0message: the door to a September rate cut is now wide open. The\u00a0only suspense is whether\u00a0Powell\u00a0will nibble with 25 basis points \u2013 or cut far more boldly.\nBut here\u2019s the lingering fear, from the West Wing to Wall Street: While\u00a0Powell\u00a0may now grasp that\u00a0tariffs don\u2019t fuelpersistent inflation, he still doesn\u2019t understand\u00a0who pays.\nGOOD ECONOMIC DATA IS BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP\u2019S INTEREST RATE PUSH\nMemo to\u00a0Jay: Every\u00a0one of America\u2019s major trading partners \u2013 the same countries driving our\u00a0$1 trillion annual trade deficit\u00a0\u2013 is deeply dependent\u00a0on\u00a0access to the U.S. market.

American families are already being crushed by the world\u2019s highest mortgage rates, small businesses can\u2019t get affordable credit, and exporters face a dollar so overvalued it prices them out ofglobal markets.\nGlobal rate spreads underscore just how out of touch the Fed is with the rest of the world. The European Central Bank\u2019s deposit facility sits at\u00a02%. The Bank of Japan holds near\u00a00.5%. China runs its seven-day repo at\u00a01.4%. Against that backdrop, the Fed\u2019s\u00a04.25%\u20134.50% target range\u00a0remains a glaring outlier \u2013 more than 200 basis points above Europe, nearly 400 above Japan, and triple China.\nLEFT'S TARIFF DOOMSDAY PREDICTIONS FALL FLAT AS TRUMP'S AMERICA THRIVES\nThe result: the U.S. economy combines the world\u2019s highest policy rates and mortgage rates with the world\u2019s strongest currency \u2013 a\u00a0triple hit\u00a0to American exporters.\nOn\u00a0the home front, the\u00a0Powell\u00a0squeeze is just as punishing. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates remain stuck in the\u00a06\u20137% range, double pre-pandemic levels. That locks millions of young families out of the housing market and stalls residential construction \u2014 historically\u00a0one of the most powerful engines ofU.S. recoveries.\nSmall businesses, reliant\u00a0on\u00a0bank credit rather than Wall Street bond markets, face\u00a0double-digit loan rates\u00a0that suffocate job creation.

Now, point-of-sale systems like Square, Clover and Toast flashpre-set\u00a0tip\u00a0buttons\u2013 20%, 25%, 30% \u2013 with\u00a0the\u00a0\"custom\u00a0tip\" option tucked away like a secret menu item.\u00a0 Or, even better, many plans automatically add\u00a0the\u00a020% \"service gratuity\" and play\u00a0the\u00a0hide-and-seek game of making you try to figure out\u00a0the\u00a0tip\u00a0they already left for you on\u00a0the\u00a0bill.\nAnd let\u2019s be honest:\u00a0the\u00a0person who just rang you up often flips\u00a0the\u00a0screen around and stands\u00a0there, watching, while you make your choice.\u00a0The\u00a0people in line behind you see it too. It\u2019s not just payment \u2013 it\u2019s a real-time social experiment in generosity and public pressure.\u00a0People have called it \"guilt\u00a0tipping\" for several years, but it feels like flat out extortion.\nTRUMP SENDS MILITARY AFTER THE CARTELS AND IT\u2019S LONG OVERDUE\nIt\u2019s Not Tariffs. It\u2019s a Shift of Responsibility\nInflationhas been\u00a0the\u00a0suggested silent partner in\u00a0tipping creep. If a burger was $10 a few years ago, a 20%\u00a0tip\u00a0was $2. Now that same burger is $14 or $15, so your \"same\" 20%\u00a0tip\u00a0is already costing more. But here\u2019s\u00a0the\u00a0kicker \u2013 those digital prompts aren\u2019t even suggesting 20% anymore. Since\u00a0the\u00a0restauranteur sets\u00a0the\u00a0amounts,\u00a0they continue to shift\u00a0the\u00a0responsibility by shifting\u00a0the\u00a0prompts to a 20%, 22%, 25% and 30% grid, meaning your\u00a0tip\u00a0has nearly doubled in dollar terms since 2019.\nWhose Job Is It to Pay Wages?\nHere\u2019s\u00a0the\u00a0part few want to say out loud, but I\u2019ll say it even if nobody likes it: it\u2019s not\u00a0the\u00a0customer\u2019s job to pay a company\u2019s employees a fair wage \u2013 that\u2019s\u00a0the\u00a0employer\u2019s responsibility.\nIf a bakery chooses to raise its hourly wage from $14 to $18, that\u2019s a cost of doing business. But instead of raising menu prices transparently, many businesses simply crank up\u00a0the\u00a0tip\u00a0prompts, quietly outsourcing payroll costs to customers.\nThat\u2019s silent inflation. Your coffee didn\u2019t get bigger, your sandwich didn\u2019t improve, but your bill went up because you\u2019re now covering part of\u00a0the\u00a0employer\u2019s wage bill \u2013 on top of higher food prices.\nTRUMP BREAKS 'DAY ONE' PROMISE TO LOWER COSTS AS PRICES SURGE ACROSS AMERICA IN FIRST SIX MONTHS\nThe\u00a0Expanding Definition of \"Tippable\"\nTipping used to be for service jobs where base pay relied on gratuities \u2013 servers, bartenders, delivery drivers. Now? You\u2019ll find\u00a0tip\u00a0requests at self-checkout kiosks, bakeries where you serve yourself, and even car washes where you never meet an employee.\nAnd consider companies like Uber, who said\u00a0the\u00a0main differentiation was that you don\u2019t have to worry about\u00a0tips. Now, you are in some weird random dating game where your driver is rating you and you are rating\u00a0them.\u00a0Except if you don\u2019t leave a\u00a0tip,\u00a0what\u00a0rating do you think\u00a0they are really going to give you?\nWhen every transaction is \"tippable,\"\u00a0tipping stops being a reward for exceptional service and becomes just another line item in your budget.\nAre You All\u00a0Tipped Out?\nMandatory\u00a0tips erode\u00a0the\u00a0meaning of\u00a0tipping itself.\u00a0 It\u2019s why people love to travel to Europe because\u00a0they don\u2019t have to worry about it when\u00a0they go out for dinner. Customers start\u00a0tipping out of shame instead of appreciation. And when\u00a0tipping is seen as automatic,\u00a0the\u00a0incentive for great service can disappear.\u00a0And it\u2019s disappearing every single day.\u00a0For families already feeling\u00a0the\u00a0pinch of inflation, an extra 5\u201310% on every meal out isn\u2019t small change \u2013 it\u2019s real money.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nCan We Get A\u00a0Tipping Reset?\nWe need a cultural reset.

This landmark legislation, a part of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act, will help get American education back on track and improve opportunities for generations of Americans to come.\nQuality educationis foundational to success; it is the key to unlocking the American dream, and as Tim Scott rightly says, the closest thing to magic in America.\nFor too long, however, parents have been forced to accept a one-size-fits-all approach to education that often does not work, and which has failed millions of students across decades. Those failures disproportionately affect low-income and minority families, whose children are frequently trapped in failing schools with no alternatives.\nPresident Donald Trump signs the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act at the White House on the Fourth of July.(Samuel Corum/Getty Images)\nIt is a system that led to test scores that lag the rest of the world, poor literacy rates, too many children giving up and dropping out of school \u2013 and ultimately, a failure toproperly educateour rising generation.\nHOW TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' ENDS DECADES OF TEMPORARY TAX POLICY GAMES IN WASHINGTON\nThe consequences of academic failure are far more consequential than just failing a grade. Poor academic performance dramatically increases the likelihood of poverty, incarceration, joblessness and drug abuse. When a kid doesn\u2019t achieve his or her potential, it hurts society. It hurts us all.\nIt was long past time for Washington to act \u2013 and we did so decisively.\nGiving parents the ability to choose the school that best meets their child\u2019s individual needs is about more than just test scores \u2013 it\u2019s about giving every child a real shot at success.\nThe One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act establishes the first-of-its-kindtax credit scholarshipprogram for all types of educational settings.

Parents and students will receive these scholarships tax-free.\nTRUMP JUST SCORED THE BIGGEST CONSERVATIVE VICTORY IN THREE DECADES\nThe result? Tens of billions of dollars for scholarships will be made available to K-12 students all across America. Millions of families will now be able to send their children to a school that aligns with their values and beliefs. Parents will be able to reclaim control of their children\u2019s education.\nThirty states right now have at least one private school choice program currently in effect. The education freedom provision we championed \u2013 and President Trump signed into law \u2013 now gives every state a choice: will they give new opportunities to students, or will they bow to the demands of the union bosses?\nSadly, every single Democrat inCongressvoted against the most important civil rights legislation of the 21st century. But President Trump and the Republican Congress delivered.\nIt was our responsibility to fix a broken system. Our own parents worked hard and sacrificed to give us opportunities they never had. And we want the same \u2013 and more \u2013 for today\u2019s children.\nAs a nation, the truth is weneedmore.

USPS lost $94 billion between 2007 and 2020. The agency carries more than $188 billion in liabilities and unfunded obligations. Meanwhile, private carriers like FedEx and UPS are thriving, innovating and investing in automation while USPS remains bloated, bureaucratic and bogged down by outdated infrastructure and a labor force that\u2019s nearly impossible to reform due to union pressure and congressional meddling.\nTHE FED\u2019S FOOLISH INTEREST RATE POLICY IS STOPPING AMERICA\u2019S ECONOMY FROM BOOMING\nSome will say, \"But, Ted, thePostal Serviceprovides a vital public good.

The historic trade deals and peace deals he secured on behalf of the American people made President Trump\u2019s second 100 days just as successful as the first.\"\nTrump hit his 100th day of his second administration in April, which included operating at warp speed as Trump signed dozens of executive orders, leveled harsh tariffs on foreign nations to bring parity to the U.S.' trade deficit, negotiated with foreign nations to work to end wars, unveiled the Department of Government Effeciency to investigate the federal government for potential mismanagement and fraud, locked down the U.S. border with Mexico and continued an overhaul of the federal government so it falls in line with the admin's \"America First\" policies.\nThe first 100 days of a new administration commonly has been viewed as a symbolic benchmark to measure a president's early successes. A White House official told Fox Digital that Trump's measure of success was not only seen in the first 100 days, but also in the timeframe between the 100th day and Aug. 7 \u2014 the 200th day.\nThe White House touted that the administration across the board has seen big wins involving immigration, the economy and trade, education, foreign policy, bilateral meetings, strides in the AI race, unleashing energy initiatives and releasing bombshell details on the Russia hoax from the Obama era in the past 100 days.\nTRUMP HAS NOW BEEN IN OFFICE FOR SIX MONTHS, FOR THE SECOND TIME.

It also rescinds certain Biden-era green energy tax credits, allocates approximately $350 billion for defense and Trump\u2019s mass deportation efforts and institutes Medicaid reforms.\n\"We have officially made the Trump tax cuts permanent,\" Trump said during the July signing ceremony. \"That's the largest tax cut in the history of our country. . . . \u00a0After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship economically. We've delivered no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors. It makes the child tax credit permanent for 40 million American families.

Energy companies in the past 100 days have pledged billions to upgrade nuclear plants and modernize gas pipelines, while the administration celebrated the July opening of the newest coal plant in Wyoming in decades, as well as Trump signing a multidecade agreement to increase natural gas exports\u00a0to Europe.\nOn the domestic political front, the Trump administration has also championed uncovering and releasing further details surrounding theRussian collusion hoaxthat plagued Trump's 2016 presidential win and first presidency.\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard released bombshell unclassified documents in July that reportedly show \"overwhelming evidence\" that then-President Barack Obama and his national security team allegedly laid the groundwork for what would be the yearslong Trump\u2013Russia collusion probe after Trump's election win against former Secretary of StateHillary Clintonin 2016.\nFOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM\n\"The implications of this are frankly nothing short of historic,\" Gabbard told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in July.\n\"Over 100 documents that we released on Friday really detail and provide evidence of how this treasonous conspiracy was directed by President Obama just weeks before he was due to leave office after President Trump had already gotten elected,\" she continued. \"This is not a Democrat or Republican issue. This is an issue that is so serious it should concern every single American, because it has to do with the integrity of our democratic republic.\"\nAttorney GeneralPam Bondidirected the DOJ to act on the criminal referral Gabbard sent in July over the matter.

This decisive action defends the American taxpayer, safeguards our land, and averts what would have been one of the largest, most irresponsible wind projects in the nation.\"\nThe Interior Department's action follows a Day One executive order signed by Trump that moved to place a temporary moratorium on the controversial wind project.

Our military systems\u2014from aircraft and submarines to advanced weaponry\u2014rely heavily on copper, as do essential civilian sectors, including the electrical grid, telecommunications networks, and cutting-edge manufacturing.\nDespite copper\u2019s strategic importance, America\u2019s copper industry continues to behollowed outby unfair foreign trade practices\u2014including state-subsidized overcapacity and below-cost dumping by countries like China, Vietnam, and India to export manipulation and predatory pricing by countries like Chile, Peru, and Mexico. These practices, often violating WTO rules, depress global copper prices and discourage investment in domestic smelting and refining facilities. Combined with burdensome domestic regulations, this has left America dangerously reliant on foreign sources for a metal critical to our defense and economic security.\nMORNING GLORY: PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE UNITED STATES\u2019 MASSIVE TARIFF HAUL IN HIS FIRST SIX MONTHS BACK\nOnce a global leader in copper mining, refining, and manufacturing, the U.S. now faces a perilous dependence on imports. Our refining capacity alone has declined by 56 percent since the late 1990s, forcing us into the absurd position of exporting raw copper ore and scrap overseas, only to re-import finished products. This isn\u2019t merely inefficient\u2014it\u2019s strategically reckless.\nThe trade deficit in copper-intensive downstream products underscores our vulnerability. Between 2010 and 2024, this deficit surged from $4.8 billion to a staggering $19.4 billion, a 302 percent increase. Last year alone, America imported nearly a million metric tons of refined copper to meet basic domestic needs. Every pound of copper imported is a pound we could and should be processing right here at home, creating American jobs andsecuring our supply chains.\nThis troubling dependence is compounded by global overcapacity in copper refining, predominantly fueled by state-subsidized overproduction abroad. The result? America has become dangerously reliant on foreign sources for a metal integral to our defense and economic security.\nTo address this threat, President Trump, acting decisively under Section 232 authority, has imposed tariffs designed to rebuild and safeguard America\u2019s copper supply chains. Specifically, the President is implementing an immediate 50 percent tariff on imported semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products. Additionally, refined copper imports will face a phased tariff\u2014starting at 15 percent in 2027 and increasing to 30 percent in 2028. These measured steps will provide critical breathing room for U.S. companies to ramp up domestic refining and processing capabilities.\nTrump Tariff \"panicans\" will inevitably complain about costs and economic disruption. But let\u2019s be clear: these tariffs represent amodest and necessary premiumcompared to the enormous risks posed by continued dependence on foreign copper.\nWe've learned from prior Section 232 actions on steel and aluminum that tariffs can successfully revitalize critical industries. Those actions attracted billions of dollars in new investment, restored domestic capacity, created thousands of jobs, and secured crucial materials for our military and infrastructure.\nThe tariffs on copper will yield similar results. They will catalyze the revival of domestic refining and smelting capabilities, incentivize investment in new technologies, and put Americans back to work in states across our great land producing the copper we desperately need.\nThe United States holds abundant copper reserves\u2014enough to fully meet domestic demand for approximately 40 years. Arizona alone hosts some of the country's largest deposits, including the Morenci mine, one of North America's most productive copper sources.\nRevitalizing America\u2019s copper industry means revitalizing American communities. From copper mines in Arizona and Montana to smelters and processing plants in Utah, Texas, and Indiana, these tariffs will help create thousands of high-paying, blue-collar jobs. Investments will flow into exploration, refining, and downstream manufacturing\u2014boosting local economies and rebuilding the industrial heartland. This is economic nationalism for national security\u2019s sake.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIn an era defined by strategic competition and supply chain vulnerabilities, we cannot afford passive reliance on foreign producers who harm our country with their massive exports. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed thecritical risksof relying on foreign supply chains, underscoring the need to strengthen domestic production capabilities for strategic materials like copper.\nThese new Trump copper tariffs will help reduce America's persistent trade deficit and safeguard our economy against dangerous supply interruptions during geopolitical tensions or future global crises. Domestic production of critical materials like copper is not just sound economics; it\u2019s imperative to maintain our sovereignty and security.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAmerica's copper industry\u2014and the American workers who sustain it\u2014have waited far too long for decisive action.

The decision is\u00a0extremely foolish.\nBy keeping rates at a comparatively high level, relative to the average rate over the past two decades, the Fed is unnecessarily suppressingeconomic growthand making it harder for consumers and businesses to finance debt. Moreover, the unemployment rate rose in July to 4.2%, marking an uptick from June and underscoring that the labor market is cooling, and the economy is in need of support.\nThe federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to each other overnight \u2014 is a powerful tool used by the Federal Reserve to influence U.S. economic activity. Changes to this rate ripple throughout the economy, affecting borrowing costs, consumer behavior, and, ultimately, the broader business cycle.\nBACK FROM SCOTLAND, TRUMP ENTERS CRUCIAL TRADE WEEK AND EYES FED'S DECISION ON RATE CUTS\nHigher rates mean it becomes more expensive for banks to borrow money overnight. This cost is often passed on to consumers and businesses through higher interest rates on loans and credit.\nCritics are calling out Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates. FILE: Powell testifies during a House Oversight and Reform Select Subcommittee hearing on the Coronavirus crisis, on Capitol Hill in Washington, June 22, 2021.(Graeme Jennings/Pool via REUTERS)\nWhen the Fed lowers the funds rate, borrowing becomes cheaper, and this generally stimulates more economic activity.\nMost analysts believe that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to keep interest rates high, relative to the average rate over the past 15 years, is being driven by fear.Fed Chairman Jerome Powelland some of the other leaders at the central bank say that if they lower interest rates,inflationwill surge, driving up already high costs on goods and services across the economy.\nGOOD ECONOMIC DATA IS BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP\u2019S INTEREST RATE PUSH\nHowever, the best evidence tells a very different story.\nFirst of all, there currently is no inflation crisis.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in July that the consumer price index \u2014 one of the most popular measures of inflation \u2014 increased in June by 2.7% compared to one year prior.\nAlthough the CPI in June was slightly higher than the CPI recorded in May (2.4%), both months remained below the levels recorded in December 2024 (2.9%) and January 2025 (3%). Additionally, inflation has leveled off substantially from where it was during much ofJoeBiden\u2019spresidency.\nSecond, historical data and recent experience show that the Fed\u2019s view of inflation and interest rates is completely misguided. The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate is not a significant factor in causing or preventing inflation.\nTRUMP\u2019S HOUSING CHIEF RIPS POWELL FOR BLOWING MILLIONS ON FED FACELIFT DURING HOUSING CRISIS HE PERPETUATES\nFor example, during President Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in office, the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate was extremely low,\u00a0consistently less than 1%. Yet,\u00a0inflation was also extremely low, even during years in which the economy added a significant number of jobs.\nMost analysts believe that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to keep interest rates high, relative to the average rate over the past 15 years, is being driven by fear.\nNotably, during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates substantially \u2014 though not nearly as high as they are now \u2014 and inflation remained relatively the same as it had been under much of Obama\u2019s term.\nThese are not exceptions to the rule. A review of data over the past half-century shows there\u2019s no strong correlation between the Fed\u2019s interest rate and inflation.\nFEDERAL RESERVE LEAVES INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED\nThat doesn\u2019t mean interest rates are irrelevant, or that they should be at or near zero. Keeping interest rates too low over a long period can create significant unintended consequences, such as encouraging increases in public and private debt. But the idea that Powell and his pals at the Fed are staving off an inflation crisis by keeping rates high is delusional.\nAll that the Fed is achieving by refusing to cut rates \u2014 even by just half a percentage point \u2014 is making it costlier for everyone to finance debt. This has enormous economic implications, especially for businesses wanting to expand and families looking to buy or sell a home, car, or another high-priced item.\nThe Federal Reserve hasn't treated former President Joe Biden and President Trump's economies the same.(Getty Images)\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates high is, by design, keeping America\u2019s economy from booming.\nIf the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate isn\u2019t the most important factor when considering inflation, then what is? The answer is, it all depends on the circumstances.\nSEN RAND PAUL: THERE ARE $186 BILLION REASONS WHY WE MUST AUDIT THE FED\nInflation occurs when the prices of goods and services across the economy rise, making your money worth less than it was before. One common cause is when people are spending a lot and demand for things like food, housing, or cars increases faster than companies can supply them. When this happens, businesses often raise prices because they know customers are willing to pay more.\nAnother cause is when it becomes more expensive for businesses to produce goods. If wages go up, raw materials cost more, or energy becomes pricier, companies may pass those extra costs on to consumers by raising prices.\nInflation can also happen when there\u2019s a large increase in the amount of money circulating in the economy. If the government prints a lot of money or spends heavily without matching production, the value of money can fall. When each dollar buys less than before, prices rise to make up the difference.\nTRUMP IS CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE FED IS MANAGED MORE THAN ABOUT FIRING POWELL, SAYS DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF\nDuring the Biden presidency, all these things occurred. Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress spent obscene amounts of money, imposed policies that sent energy prices skyrocketing, increased regulatory burdens on businesses, and discouraged people from working by hooking millions on government programs.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAdditionally, COVID-19 lockdowns, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East raised uncertainty and, in some cases, severely impacted supply chains, raising prices on a long list of goods and services.\nBut now, the lockdowns are over, supply chains and markets have adjusted to the recent international turmoil, investment in America is on rise, and people are back to work.\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to keep rates high is, by design, keeping America\u2019s economy from booming.\nThere\u2019s simply no reason to believe that a modest interest rate cut would cause inflation to increase dramatically, if at all.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhy, then, are Powell and the other Fed governors keeping rates higher than needed?

He plans on doing that through House Bill 125, a state-level DOGE initiative named after him that recently passed the legislature.\n\"It helps to give our office and the state auditor's office more resources to take a look at efficiencies and ways to really drill down on determining a good return on investment of taxpayer dollars across North Carolina,\" Boliek said.\n\"I really support the effort,\" he said, in part. \"We've got the team in place, and we've got the ability to really get effective results.\"\nDOGE PREPARES TO LITERALLY DRAIN THE SWAMP BY BANISHING BIDEN'S 'OVERREACHING' WATER RULE\nNorth Carolina state auditor Dave Boliek said he is looking forward to \"keeping government accountable\" by cutting wasteful spending through a state form of DOGE.(Getty Images)\nThe bill includes a provision for the state auditor to establish a Division of Accountability, Value and Efficiency, otherwise known as the DAVE Act. The billpassed the legislaturelast week with bipartisan support \u2013 a 91-23 vote in the House and a 47-2 vote in the Senate.\nThe measure now sits at Gov. Josh Stein's desk, and while it is unclear if he will sign the measure into law, the ability to override a potential veto is there with a Republican majority in both chambers and enough Democrat support.\n\"It will become law. I'm very confident that it will,\" Boliek said.\nBoliek explained that his office will be taking a \"data-driven approach\" to determining the best \"return on investment in taxpayer dollars.\" He also said his office will look across the entire state government to identify where it can be more efficient rather than focusing on specific key areas.\n\"I think it'd be unfair to sort of pick out one specific area where we see cuts are necessary because we haven't taken that deep dive yet, but we are going to use modern computer programs, we're going to use AI and we're going to use a lot of data analysis to come up with solid common-sense recommendations,\" he said.\nTEXAS CREATES ITS OWN VERSION OF DOGE AS GOV.

There may be areas where the state is responsible for serving citizens, and we're not putting in enough resources. The legislature has been very clear about giving us that freedom to take a look at those areas as well, like where we are underfunding certain things,\" Boliek added.\nWhen asked about areas theTrump administrationfocused on with DOGE that Boliek could continue with at the state level, he said he wants to pursue initiatives in a data-driven way to ensure his office is backing up its recommendations for cuts or enhancements with \"solid data\" and \"not just a feeling.\"\n\"The approach should be to take a look at how taxpayer dollars are being spent and ask \u2018what is the return on investment?\u2019 If we're spending tax dollars on a specific program, the real question is what kind of return are taxpayers getting for that amount of money?

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nWe\u2019re living in a time when you can finance pizza. Where $100 jeans can be split into four easy payments. Where \"zero interest\" sounds like free money. But behind the buzzwords and flashy apps,\u00a0Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)\u00a0is turning into one of the most financially destructive forces in America.\nWhat started as a clever tech innovation to help people \"manage cash flow\" has become a full-blown debt trap \u2014 one that\u2019s quietly ruining the financial health of working families across the country. BNPL is marketed like a budgeting hack, but it\u2019s really the worst thing that\u2019s happened to consumers since paydayloans.\nLet\u2019s cut through the hype and look at the facts. According to a 2023 report by TransUnion, BNPL usage soared 43% in a single year. Roughly 40% of users have missed at least one payment, and those missed payments often come with hefty late fees or aggressive collections. A\u00a02023 CFPB report\u00a0indicates that amongconsumersin households charged an insufficient funds (NSF) fee in the past year, 85% were also charged an overdraft fee.\nHIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS DISCOVER THE BIG SECRET ABOUT CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION\nMeanwhile, Americans are already up to their eyeballs in other forms of debt.Credit card balanceshave now hit an all-time high of\u00a0$1.12 trillion, according to theFederal Reserve Bankof New York. Auto loan delinquencies are rising fast \u2014 over 7.6% of borrowers are 30 days past due, the highest level in over a decade. And since the federalstudent loan pauseended,\u00a0more than 40% of borrowers haven\u2019t resumed payments.\u00a0We\u2019ve built a nation that\u2019s not just living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 it\u2019s now borrowing paycheck to paycheck.\nBuy now, pay later introduces a whole new type of borrowing where consumers borrow in their day-to-day lives, not for big items.\nAnd BNPL is pouring gasoline on that fire.\nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s so dangerous: it doesn\u2019t\u00a0feel\u00a0like debt. When you swipe acredit card,you know you\u2019re borrowing. When you click \"pay later\" on a website, it feels like nothing happened. But something did happen \u2014 you took out a loan.\nMAGA COUNTRY VOTERS SOUND ALARM OVER \u2018RIDICULOUS\u2019 NATIONAL DEBT AMID DEBATE OVER TRUMP-BACKED BILL\nAnd instead of thinking about the total cost, consumers focus on the $25-a-week illusion. It\u2019s\u00a0predatory\u00a0because it masks the risk. It convinces people they can afford things they absolutely cannot.\nI\u2019m seeing it firsthand in conversations across the country: People don\u2019t even realize how many plans they\u2019ve signed up for. Klarna here. Afterpay there. Affirm on something else. According to industry data, the average BNPL user has\u00a0four to six active plans \u2014 but most couldn\u2019t tell you the total amount they owe.\nAnd it\u2019s not just big-ticket items like laptops or furniture anymore. People are now financing gas, groceries and\u00a0takeout. Think about that: We\u2019re borrowing money to buy things that are gone in a week.\u00a0 Even short-term loans to make it to our next paycheck.\nThis isn\u2019t just financially unsound \u2014 it\u2019s culturally dangerous. BNPL is normalizing the idea that you\u00a0deserve\u00a0to have something now and worry about paying for it later. It\u2019s instant gratification on steroids. It\u2019s teaching young people that budgeting means stacking multiple payment plans \u2014 not actually saving money.\nINVISIBLE TAX: GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CRUSHING YOUR FINANCES\nYou know what system worked better when I was growing up? Layaway.\u00a0That\u2019s right \u2014 good, old-fashioned, unglamorous layaway. You saw something you wanted. You made small payments. And\u00a0only after\u00a0you paid in full did you walk out the door with the item. No debt. No fees. No collections. Layaway required patience. It taught discipline. It was about saving\u00a0before you spent.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nBNPL flips that on its head. It removes friction. It encourages consumption without consequence. Retailers love it because it boosts sales. Tech companies love it because it boosts engagement. But the American consumer? They\u2019re the ones stuck holding the bag when all those \"easy payments\" come due at once. \u00a0It\u2019s the same trap as payday loans, just with better branding.\nAnd instead of thinking about the total cost, consumers focus on the $25-a-week illusion. It\u2019s\u00a0predatory\u00a0because it masks the risk. It convinces people they can afford things they absolutely cannot.\nEven regulators are waking up. TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureauhas flagged BNPL for deceptive practices, lack of transparency and the use of consumerdata for marketing.But they\u2019re behind the curve. This market has already ballooned to $80 billion\u00a0in annual transactions\u2014and it\u2019s only getting bigger.\nSo, what\u2019s the solution?\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWe need to go back to basics. We need to\u00a0teach people to save before they spend. It\u2019s called\u00a0delayed gratification and people in America just don\u2019t understand this concept anymore. We need to stop pretending that BNPL is some kind of harmless financial tool. It\u2019s the fast track to delinquency and bankruptcy for people who can least afford it.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, we need to bring back the layaway counter at your local department store. Because the lesson there was simple but powerful:\u00a0If you can\u2019t pay for it today, wait until you can.

The policy, which \"Mayor Rahm Emanuel rightly killed in 2014,\" is one where businesses are taxed based on how many employees they have.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nUnder the leadership of PresidentDonald Trump,we have a chance to make civil service great again.\nIn many ways, the Founding Fathers were the original civil servants. They were the start-up founders who inspired generations to work on behalf of the American dream long before there was an institutionalized civil service \u2013 later formalized by thePendleton Civil Service Act of 1883and bolstered by Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s leadership as commissioner of the U.S. Civil Service Commission (the modern predecessor of today\u2019s Office of Personnel Management, which I have the privilege to lead).\nAcross two and a half centuries since our nation\u2019s founding, public servants have heeded the clarion call of the noblest of missions: from forming our nation after the American Revolution to ultimately cementing our supremacy during the Cold War by literally shooting for the moon via the Apollo program. These bold entreaties inspired the nation's best and brightest to embrace public service.\nTRUMP DECLARES US WILL WIN GLOBAL AI RACE DURING EXECUTIVE ORDER SIGNING CEREMONY: 'WHATEVER IT TAKES'\nFor over 50 years since the Apollo landing, however, the public\u2019s interest incivil servicehas plummeted back down to earth. Many Founding Fathers such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were polymaths who chose to focus their genius on creating the best government the world had ever seen. But if Alexander Hamilton, our first Treasury secretary, were alive today, he likely would be working in Silicon Valley or Wall Street, instead of in the federal government.\nThe Trump administration wants to make civil service the best it can be. FILE: Travelers make their way through Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on May 24, 2024, in Arlington, Virginia.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nFirst, the mission \u2013 since the days of moonshots, the federal workforce has not been asked to \"dream big\" or innovate. Instead, they have been tasked with managing small problems, preserving the status quo and protecting against the downside at all costs.\nSecond, incentives \u2013 power and prestige derive from the size of an agency\u2019s headcount and budget. In all cases, more is better.\nCHINA IS EXPLOITING OUR GOVERNMENT'S TECH WEAKNESS. WE NEED A RAPID REBOOT\nThird, the lack of a high-performance culture \u2013 a focus on equity over merit and job stability over accountability.\nFourth, treating technology as a second-class citizen \u2013 instead, the answer to most problems has been more headcount.\nFifth, an arms-length relationship with the private sector that fails to create partnership, particularly when it comes to attracting talent in critical areas.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nFirst, Trump has no shortage of moonshots to transform America\u2019s economic future \u2013 winning in\u00a0artificial intelligence,\u00a0unleashing American energy, revolutionizing financial technology with\u00a0cryptocurrencies,\u00a0reindustrializing\u00a0the heartland,\u00a0making America healthy again, and the list goes on. Inspiring missions inspire great minds who want to be a part of something truly transformational.\nAS MUSK EXITS DOGE, A LOOK BACK AT PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO CUT WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE \u2013 AND HOW THEY FARED\nSecond, changing the incentives that ultimately drive civil service behavior. If we give employees permission to take \"measured\" risks, to think from first principles, to be willing to pilot new ideas with the understanding that we won\u2019t score a 100%, to make operational efficiency and stewardship of taxpayer dollars a first-class citizen, we can change behavior. Let\u2019s reward creativity, continuous improvement and doing more with less; power should no longer derive from organizational bloat, but rather from financially sound outcomes.\nThird, we can create a high-performance culture. We must disproportionately reward those who create the most value for the taxpayer and remove employees from the organization who aren\u2019t able to respond to performance improvement guidance. No more \"peanut buttering\" of annual evaluations and bonuses to achieve equity goals; we should instead demand excellence.\nBut if Alexander Hamilton, our first Treasury secretary, were alive today, he likely would be working in Silicon Valley or Wall Street, instead of in the federal government.\nFourth, make the adoption of technology a key tenet of success. The government should be a leading testing ground for new technologies, rather than the last bastion of mainframe computers. Eliminate the \"not invented here\" bias that pervades government adoption of technology; we don\u2019t need to build bespoke applications when third parties have superior solutions.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nLastly,embrace the private sectorto partner on talent. We can build out public-private exchanges, secondment opportunities, and higher education pathways to ensure that the government gets access to the best and brightest. Of course, many people may ultimately choose to spend the majority of their careers in the private sector, but they can still contribute to success in the public sector.\nPresident Trump is ushering in aGolden Age for Americaby reforming the government bureaucracy to work for the American people.\u00a0We will make the civil service great again.

These laws include certain caps on tariff amounts, they noted, as well as timeframes reviewable by Congress.\nJudge Evan Wallach rattled off a list of such statutes. Compared to these, he said, IEEPA \"doesn\u2019t include the word tariffs anywhere.\"\nTARIFF FIGHT ESCALATES AS TRUMP APPEALS SECOND COURT LOSS\nPresident Donald Trump, left, speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House April 2, 2025, in Washington, D.C., as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick listens.(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\nHe added that when the law was passed in 1977, tariffs were a relevant issue included in other statutes, suggesting that, had Congress intended for them to be there, they would have been.\nJustice Department Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate acknowledged the IEEPA law does not include the word \"tariffs.\" Still, he argued that the trade deficit between the U.S. and trading partners had \"reached a tipping point,\" which he said enabled the administration to use emergency powers to take action.\n\"It\u2019s affecting our military readiness,\" he told the court. \"It\u2019s affecting our domestic manufacturing capability.\"\nShumate was also asked if the administration believes that Trump's power under IEEPA is \"unbounded,\" and, if true, whether it believes the president\u2019s actions are reviewable by the courts.\nShumate said in response he believes the administration should answer to a congressional delegation.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi speaks alongside President Donald Trump on recent Supreme Court rulings in the briefing room at the White House June 27, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\nArguing for the plaintiffs, Neal Katyal told the court that Trump, in invoking IEEPA, is attempting a \"breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years.\"\n\"Our federal courts are powerless if the president can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, for as long as he wants, so long as he declares an emergency,\" he said.\nUsing the IEEPA law to enact the tariffs Trump outlined during his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" event would mark the first time in U.S. history that tariff powers would be enacted by a president in an instance not specifically delegated by Congress.\nAs the oral arguments came to a close, it was not immediately clear how judges on the panel would rule, though some suggested the possibility of partly upholding the lower court ruling that had blocked Trump\u2019s use of IEEPA.\nTRUMP TARIFF PLAN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS COURT BATTLES INTENSIFY\n\"But IEPPA has been rarely used, hasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s been over 50 years since it\u2019s been used?\" Judge Jimmie Reyna asked Shumate.\nOutside the courthouse, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who helped represent the 12 states suing over the plan, told Fox News Digital he expects the appeals court decision to come in weeks or months, not days, an acknowledgment that the Aug. 1 enforcement date will likely be well in the rearview when a ruling lands.\nStill, he said, \"We're optimistic based on the courtroom today that we will be successful (or) partially successful,\" he said.\n\"When the\u00a0federal government comes in and says that [the court] has absolutely no right to review what the president does under IEEPA, you actually heard laughter in the room,\" he said, describing it as a \"flop\" that may sit poorly with the judges.\nOn April 2, Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, along with higher, reciprocal tariffs targeting select nations, including China. He said the measures would address trade imbalances, reduce deficits with key trading partners and boost domestic manufacturing and production.\nHowever, whether emergency tariffs are the appropriate vehicle to accomplish this is an open question and one central to Thursday's oral arguments before the appeals court.\nPlaintiffs inV.O.S. Selections Inc. v. Trump argued Thursday that the looming tariffs have already introduced confusion and volatility into markets, threatening the bottom lines of small U.S. businesses and making it difficult for owners to operate under shifting guidance that seems to change on a whim.\nOthers argue the tariffs are more a negotiating tool designed to bring trading partners to the table to negotiate new deals.\nJUDGES V.

Talks for a longer-term deal are ongoing.\nSmall businesses in the U.S. have been hit with months of \"complete uncertainty,\" Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation of the Liberty Justice Center, one of the groups representing small businesses in court, said in an interview Wednesday.\n\"That's largely due to the fact that the president asserts the power to impose tariffs on any country he wants, for any reason \u2014 and at any rate he wants, at any time he wants,\" Schwab said.\n\"So, there's no certainty on what the rate is going to be from one week to the next, and that's very difficult to do business with, when things are constantly changing.\"\nJudges on a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of International Tradevoted unanimouslyto block Trump's tariffs from taking force earlier this year, ruling that, as commander in chief, Trump does not have \"unbounded authority\" to impose tariffs under the emergency law.\nThat ruling was later paused by the appeals court in Washington, D.C., which agreed to consider the administration's request for relief.\nAhead of Thursday's oral arguments, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed lawyers would continue to defend the president's trade agenda in court.\n\"This morning, [Justice Department] attorneys are going to court to defend President Trump\u2019s tariffs, which are transforming the global economy, protecting our national security and addressing the consequences of our exploding trade deficit,\" she said. \"We will continue to defend the president.\"\nThe U.S. Supreme Court June 28, 2023, in Washington, D.C.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nSome Trump supporters have argued the tariffs are merely a negotiating tactic to getforeign governmentsto the table, though the administration has repeatedly vowed to use \"all tools\" at its disposal to advance Trump's protectionist policies.\nThe administration argued in a court filing that the IEEPA is the law that Congress passed in 1977 to allow the president to respond to \"unusual and extraordinary threats\" and in cases where a national emergency has already been declared.\nHowever, the plaintiffs argue that Trump\u2019s use of IEEPA to address the trade deficit is unlawful, pointing out that, by the administration\u2019s own admission, the deficit has persisted for nearly 50 years, undermining the claim of an \"unusual and extraordinary\" emergency.\nTheCourt of Appealsfor the Federal Circuit will likely move on the case quickly, with a decision expected in August. No matter the outcome, both sides have vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court, if necessary.\nIn the interim, economists noted there could be real harm the longer the court process takes.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSchwab, the lawyer helping represent the plaintiffs in court Thursday, said small business owners could see \"potentially irreparable harm\" as a result of court inaction.

Yvette Clarke saying that her Brooklyn district could \"absorb a significant number of these (Haitian) migrants,\" because, she continued, \"I need more people in my district, just for redistricting purposes\u2026\" This was about the time that former President Joe Biden\u2019s open border policies led to ahumanitarian crisiswith 11,000 migrants crowding under a bridge connecting Texas with Mexico in the Lone Star town of Del Rio.\nIronically, Rep. Clarke\u2019s desire for noncitizens to bolster Democrats\u2019 political power echoes arguments made during the 1787 Constitutional Convention, when Southern delegates wanted slaves to count as a full person for purposes of representation in the U.S. House, while delegates from the North argued for slaves to not count at all. They compromised on three-fifths.\nIMMIGRANTS NEEDED FOR \u2018REDISTRICTING PURPOSES,' HOUSE DEM ADMITS IN VIRAL CLIP: \u2018QUIET PART OUT LOUD\u2019\nMeanwhile, former community organizer, former California Assembly member, former member of Congress, and current Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass views federal enforcement of immigration laws as an existential threat to L.A. She called on ICE to end their enforcement offederal immigration lawin Los Angeles.\nBass is correct in one aspect of her fears\u2014that President Donald J. Trump\u2019s enforcement of U.S. laws will cause a drop in L.A.\u2019s population. During the first Trump administration, California\u2019s population declined due to increased immigration enforcement and the state\u2019s draconian COVID-19 lockdown policies under Gov. Gavin Newsom. For more than 20 years, California\u2019s high taxes and high cost of living have pushed Californians to leave the Golden State, resulting in domestic net outmigration. But California grew by a bit because there were more foreigners\u2014legal and illegal\u2014moving in than Californians moving out.\nBass, and others, argue that illegal immigrants do the jobs that Americans won\u2019t do, but recent employment data says otherwise. After five years of foreign-born employment growth while the native-born lost ground, the data since Trump took office shows a reversal.\nThe annual increase in employment among native-born Americans shot up to over 1.7 million last month. Conversely, the number of foreign-born workers with jobs has risen less than 400,000 over that same period.\nThis is a stark contrast to the situation when Trump was inaugurated. In January of this year, annual job growth among foreign-born workers was almost 1.2 million higher than job growth among native-born Americans. Fast-forward to June and the situation completely reversed, with native-born Americans seeing annual employment gains of almost 1.4 million more jobs than foreign-born workers.\nThe better labor market for Americans, combined with low inflation, has also been driving up real wages, meaning wages adjusted for price changes. Under Biden, the average American\u2019s weekly paycheck did rise substantially, by almost 20 percent, but prices spiked even faster. During Biden\u2019s four years in office, real weekly paychecks bought about 4 percent less in purchasing power.\nIn less than half a year, Trump\u2019s economic and immigration policies have reversed that slide, and the average American\u2019s real weekly paycheck has risen about 1 percent. The progress is even better when looking at the real median weekly paycheck, which is higher now than at any point in the Biden administration.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nFor blue-collar workers who suffered so much from Bidenflation and were forced to go into debt to make ends meet, the real wage growth under Trump is a welcomed change, though it hasn\u2019t completely erased the damage of the prior four years, as evidenced by the fact that households are still in $1.2 trillion of credit card debt.\nYet there\u2019s more good news on the horizon, despite the doomsday predictions from today\u2019s Democrats, who assert crops won\u2019t be picked ifillegal aliensare deported.

That number is expected to increase this month \u2014we will know for sure in a few days. Hold on to those numbers for a bit while considering the context in which they appear.\nPresidentDonald Trumpran and won in November, 2024 on a straightforward platform: Close the southern border. Prioritize the deportation of illegal migrants that are criminals or national security threats. Expand and extend the tax cuts that he initially pushed through in 2017 with the help of GOP majorities in the House and the Senate.\u00a0Rollback the regulatory burden on American businesses. Rebuild the nation\u2019s defenses through much higher defense spending. Protect girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports. End the era of \"woke\" by crushing \"DEI\" and \"CRT.\"\nPresident Trump also repeatedly stated from the time he came down the escalator in 2015 that Iran would not be permitted to obtain nuclear weapons.\u00a0His support for Israel has been greater than any previous president.\nLIZ PEEK: TRUMP'S MAJOR TRADE WINS COULD BE ROCKET FUEL TO US ECONOMY\nTrump delivered on all of these promises already. In six months. It\u2019s a stunning and unprecedented record of achievements and of promises made and kept by a presidential candidate early in his term.\nPresident Trump also ran onupending the international tradingsystem through the imposition of tariffs on almost every country doing business with the U.S. Skeptics of this set of claims were everywhere.\nThe numbers:\nJune\u2019s tariff receipts in the U.S. set a monthly record of $27 billion.\nJuly\u2019s number is expected to increase.\n\"[W]e could expect that that could be well over $300 billion by the end of the year,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declared earlier in July. (By contrast, total tariff revenue for the U.S. was $77 billion in calendar year 2024.) Bessent added that he estimates tariff revenue to the Treasury to top \"2.8 trillion over 10 years,\" \"which we think is probably low.\"\nIn January, thefederal treasury collectedapproximately $8 billion in tariffs.\u00a0\u00a0That number had more than doubled by April to $16.3 billion. The president has since concluded new tariff and trade deals with the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam and \u2014this week\u2014 the European Union. Negotiations with China are ongoing and more deals with more counties are expected as Trump\u2019s team on tariff negotiations ranges across the world accomplishing much, much more than most people thought could be accomplished this quickly.\nA decade ago the U.S. collected $35 billion in tariffs annually. That\u2019s quite a contrast: $35 billion into the U.S. treasury from tariffs in 2015; $300 billion estimated in 2025.\nPresident Trump made no secret about hisintentions on trade. As with all the other campaign promises, he has delivered and indeed redone the vast global trading system. Thus far it has been all gain and very little pain as far as consumers and voters are concerned. Stock markets have soared in the same period with a big dip when the president announced the outlines of his ambitious trade agenda, a dip that was erased as new highs were recorded.\nNow the question is: Will the skeptics of Trump\u2019s trade policies at least consider that they were wrong?\nLike most commentators, trade and tariffs have rarely been a topic for me. I began work in government in President Reagan\u2019s administration and since then the GOP has been a \"free trade\" party. Almost every Reaganaut called themselves a devotee of \"the Chicago school\" of economics even if they were not economists. This meant, in a general way, low taxes and low-to-non-existent tariffs, and a belief in free trade around the globe via open oceans patrolled primarily by the United States Navy with help from its allies. This post-World War II international trading system was built on \"GATT.\"\n\"GATT\" stands for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It was a multilateral agreement established in 1947 to promote international trade by reducing or eliminatingtariffsand other trade barriers between participating countries. There were eight \"rounds\" of GATT negotiations between 1947 and 1994, and they culminated in the creation of the World Trade Organization which came into being on January 1, 1995. In the 30 years since then, the \"WTO\" has set the rules and resolved the disputes among international trading partners.\nAt home, the Constitution vested thepower over tariffsin the Congress, but much of that power has been delegated to the president and his officials via Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Sections 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, and International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977. Some critics of President Trump\u2019s big declarations and decisions on tariffs have questioned whether he has enough power under these delegations to so thoroughly transform the rules of international trade.\nSuits have been filed and it will be a question of first impression for the Supreme Court if it gets there. We don\u2019t know what tariffs will eventually come before the Court if it even agrees to take up the matter. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments today in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President\u00a0Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer. This is the lead case testing the president\u2019s powers under IEEPA.\nAll of the countries above that have concluded new agreements with Team Trump seem to accept President Trump\u2019s authority, but the case bears watching.\nIn the meantime, what are the free traders doing?\nMany are issuing dire warnings about the future impacts on consumer prices and overall economic growth. Those fears have not been realized yet. In fact, GDP in Q2 of this year \u2014the first full quarter of Trump\u2019s second term\u2014 grew an unexpectedly robust 3.0 percent, according to the advance estimate released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nWhich should mean that critics ought to at least suspend judgment for awhile and perhaps reconsider their absolute commitments to \"free trade,\" allowing for the possibility that while America willingly subsidized the world trading order for 80 years after World War II, it also possesses the power of the world\u2019s largest economy and market and can indeed set new rules.\nMy perspective has changed to one of cautious approval of what President Trump is trying while remaining open to urging reversal if it doesn\u2019t work. My evolving POV is that the U.S. has shouldered the cost of defending the freedom of the seas for eight decades and that this expensive burden will only grow in the years ahead. Tariff revenue can be seen as the trading nations of the world\u2019s contribution to the cost of the American military.\nTo be specific: The \"One, Big, Beautiful Bill\" included a much-needed surge of $158 billion in defense spending, much of which is going to the Navy and shipbuilding and repair capacity expansion. Bravo.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe $300 billion intariff revenueexpected this year will more than cover the increase in defense spending. Bravo again.\n\"Free trade\" depends on freedom of navigation of the world\u2019s oceans and ultimately on America\u2019s military. Perhaps the skeptics of the president\u2019s tariff program should begin to at least consider that the era of \"free riders\" on the backs of the United States Navy (and broader military) is over and after 80 years of subsidizing the international trading order via our defense budget, it\u2019s time for trading nations to pay a share of that cost.\nHugh Hewitt is a Fox News contributor, and host of \"The Hugh Hewitt Show,\" heard weekdays from 3 pm to 6 pm ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

{"title": "LIZ PEEK: Trump's major trade wins could be rocket fuel to US economy", "date": "2025-07-29", "body": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick unpacks the U.S. and E.U. trade agreement on 'Special Report.'\nHats off to PresidentDonald Trump, who is singlehandedly reordering global trade, in the face of enormous opposition. The president took office pledging to make trade fair again for Americans, and he is well on his way to achieving exactly that.\nWhile the initial roll-out of histariff programin April was clumsy, the subsequent negotiation of trade deals has been masterful. Much remains to be fully fleshed out for agreements concluded in weeks as opposed to the more customary years, but the essential ingredients are straightforward. The president and his team are working to lower the barriers to U.S. exports erected by countries around the world and, where our trading partners refuse to make concessions, charging them for access to our markets.\nHere\u2019s why he can force their hands: The United States is the world\u2019s biggest economy, at $29 trillion;Chinaand the EU come next, at roughly $19 trillion. The U.S. leads in sheer size and also in the magnitude of our consumer market, at about 70% of GDP, or $20 trillion. By comparison, the Chinese consumer accounts for only some 40% of that country\u2019s GDP, or less than $8 trillion. About 52% of the EU economy comes from consumer spending, or less than $10 trillion.\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES TRADE DEAL WITH EUROPEAN UNION\nEvery country on Earth wants to export to the U.S. Consequently, our country has clout, and the president is determined to use it. He is removing tariffs that other countries have imposed on American-made goods coming into their countries and also fighting non-tariff barriers, such as illegal government subsidies, currency manipulation and arcane regulations set up by Europe and Japan, for instance, to exclude U.S. agricultural products and other goods. Our farmers are the most productive in the world \u2013 they can out-compete anyone, which has inspired tough protectionist measures from some of our trading partners.\nHistorically, countries around the world have not dealt fairly with the U.S. Conservatives dislikeTrump\u2019s tariff programbecause they say it interferes with free trade, but the global exchange of goods and services is not free. When Europe charges U.S. carmakers a 10% duty on Chevys sent to Germany, and we only charge 2.5% on Volkswagens coming here, something is off.\nOver the weekend, President Trump negotiated the grandaddy of all trade deals with the EU, imposing 15% tariffs on Europe\u2019s imports and securing commitments that the EU will import sizeable amounts of energy. Success was not assured; the president himself, on the cusp of his talks withEuropean Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyen, put the chances of concluding a deal at about 50-50. For our relentlessly optimistic president, he was cautious in the extreme, for good reason.\nBACK FROM SCOTLAND, TRUMP ENTERS CRUCIAL TRADE WEEK AND EYES FED'S DECISION ON RATE CUTS\nActually, for several good reasons. First, the EU is a fractious group of 27 sovereign nations who, despite acting as a block, have very different economies and interests. Second, EU countries are for the most part run by condescending liberal elites who view Donald Trump as uncouth and annoying, as he persistently disrespects the globalism that bind them together. Third, they bitterly resent the United States, which is running rings around them on everything that matters, like technology and energy.\nDonald Trump shakes hands with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after agreeing on a trade deal between the two economies following their meeting, in Turnberry south west Scotland on July 27, 2025.\nPresident Trump\u2019s caution was also warranted because EU leaders like to score political points back home by standing up to him; it was quite possible that the bloc\u2019s leadership would torch a compromise in order to look strong. As it is, the deal was widely panned by European officials and economists, with the ever-obstreperous French leading the way. French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou furiously denounced the pact, describing it as \"submission.\"\nFrench Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said he did not want Paris \"to settle with what happened yesterday because that would be accepting that Europe is not an economic power.\"\nHere\u2019s a newsflash for French politicians nipping at von der Leyen\u2019s ankles; Europe isn\u2019t much of an economic power. The World Bank reports that from 2008 to 2023, EU GDP grew by 13.5% (from $16.37 trillion to $18.59 trillion) while U.S. GDP rose by 87% (from $14.77 to $27.72 trillion). In addition, EU GDP per capita as a percentage of U.S. GDP per capita fell from 76.5% in 2008 to 50% in 2023.\u00a0That\u2019s downright embarrassing.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nWhy is the EU such a laggard? First, because they have imposed stifling red tape on their domestic companies. Even the International Monetary Fund has chastised France, for instance, for their rigid work rules, which makes the hiring and firing of workers expensive.\nSecond, because the EU has prostrated itself on the altar of climate change. Its dedication to renewables has led to high power costs, with German companies, for example, paying nearly three times what the U.S. does for industrial electricity. With new technologies like AI requiring vast amounts of energy, the EU is uncompetitive.\nThird, the EU is hampered by its cumbersome architecture; getting more than two dozen nations to sign off on major policies is difficult, which has meant the continent has fallen behind on technological innovation. That means low productivity and GDP growth.\nPresident Donald Trump (R) shakes hands with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (L) following their meeting, in Turnberry, south west Scotland on July 27, 2025.(Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\nEU officials are certainly not unique in expressing frustration over President Trump\u2019s tariff battle. The conventional wisdom from economists and business leaders has been thattariffs will choke off tradeand make the world poorer. Roger Altman, the successful founder of investment bank Evercore, appeared on CNBC on Monday saying, \"Eventually, the tariffs will be passed on, dollar for dollar, to the consumer, and that will mean less consumption, less growth, less jobs and less profit.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMaybe, but it\u2019s also possible that companies will bring more production to the United States, to avoid tariffs, and that the revenuespouring into the Treasury, over $100 billion to date, will boost our fiscal outlook.

And I would expect that that would be the first thing the Department of Justice would look at is the paper trail and the circumstantial evidence as to where Adam Schiff was, in fact, living,\" he continued, remarking that there are \"no shrinking violets\" at the Trump DOJ.\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and President Donald Trump.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nSchiff first fell under scrutiny this year in May, when the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sent a letter to the Department of Justice sounding the alarm that, in \"multiple instances,\"Schiff allegedly\"falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments from 2003-2019 for a Potomac, Maryland-based property.\"\nAt the heart of the issue are two properties purchased by Schiff: a home purchased in 2003 in Potomac, Maryland, for $870,000 under a Fannie Mae-backed mortgage agreement for $610,000 at a rate of 5.625% over a term of 30 years, and a 2009 Burbank, Calif., condo. Schiff reaffirmed the Potomac property as his principal residence in mortgage refinancing paperwork in 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013, according to the FHFA letter to the DOJ.\nOver the same time frame, Schiff took a homeowner\u2019s tax exemption on the Burbank condo while also claiming that home as his primary residence for a $7,000 reduction off of the 1% property tax, FHFA Director William Pulte wrote in the letter to the DOJ, citing media reports.\nIn 2023, the letter continued, a spokesperson for Schiff asserted that \"Adam\u2019s primary residence is Burbank, California, and will remain so when he wins the Senate seat.\"\nFHFA is an independent federal agency that oversees Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System.\nTRUMP INVOKES RUSSIA COLLUSION HOAX WHILE CALLING FOR LONGTIME FOE SCHIFF TO FACE JAIL TIME\nIn 2020, Schiff refinanced his mortgage, listing his Maryland home as his secondary residence.\nTrump publiclyslammed Schiff over his mortgages in July on Truth Social, accusing him of fraud and putting the issue back on the public's radar following 2023 news reports on Schiff's homes in Maryland and California.\n\"I have always suspected Shifty Adam Schiff was a scam artist,\" Trump posted to Truth Social Tuesday. \"And now I learn that Fannie Mae\u2019s Financial Crimes Division have concluded that Adam Schiff has engaged in a sustained pattern of possible Mortgage Fraud.\"\nU.S. Sen. Adam Schiff was accused of mortgage fraud and referred to the DOJ.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\"Adam Schiff said that his primary residence was in MARYLAND to get a cheaper mortgage and rip off America, when he must LIVE in CALIFORNIA because he was a Congressman fromCALIFORNIA. I always knew Adam Schiff was a Crook. The FRAUD began with the refinance of his Maryland property on February 6, 2009, and continued through multiple transactions until the Maryland property was correctly designated as a second home on October 13, 2020.\"\nFOX NEWS POLITICS NEWSLETTER: SCHIFF FLAGGED FOR POTENTIAL MORTGAGE FRAUD BY TRUMP OFFICIAL\nSchiff has repeatedly denied and brushed off the accusations, including refusing to answer questions from Fox News Digital about his alleged mortgage fraud when confronted in the nation's capital on July 16.\n\"Since I led his first impeachment, Trump has repeatedly called for me to be arrested for treason. So in a way, I guess this is a bit of a letdown. And this baseless attempt at political retribution won\u2019t stop me from holding him accountable. Not by a long shot,\" he posted to X in July following Trump's initial Truth Social attack on Schiff's mortgages.\n\"This is just Donald Trump\u2019s latest attempt at political retaliation against his perceived enemies. So it is not a surprise, only how weak this false allegation turns out to be. And much as Trump may hope, this smear will not distract from his Epstein files problem,\" he added.\nSchiff's primary residence discrepancies first hit the public's radar in 2023, when Schiff launched an ultimately successful campaign to serve in the Senate after decades in the U.S. House. CNN published the first news article detailing that Schiff had claimed the Maryland home as a primary residence while also taking a homeowner\u2019s tax exemption on the Burbank condo.\nThe campaign said at the time that Schiff's two properties were listed as primary residences \"for loan purposes because they are both occupied throughout the year and to distinguish them from a vacation property.\"\nTrump and Schiff have long been political foes, which was underscored during Trump's first administration when Schiff served as the lead House manager during the first impeachment trial against Trump in 2020, and when Schiff repeatedly promoted claims that Trump's 2016 campaigncolluded with Russia.\nWATCH: ADAM SCHIFF SILENT AFTER TRUMP ACCUSED HIM OF MORTGAGE FRAUD\nDays after Trump first posted about Schiff's mortgages in Maryland and California, the president's Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, declassified documents that reportedly show \"overwhelming evidence\" that then-President Barack Obama and his national security team laid the groundwork for what would be the yearslong Trump\u2013Russia collusion probeafter Trump's election win against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016.\nSchiff was an incredibly vocal lawmaker amid the Russian collusion claims, most notably when the House censured him in 2023 over his promotion that Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia. Schiff served in the House representing California from 2001 to 2024, when he was sworn-in as a senator after his successful 2024 campaign to serve in the nation's upper chamber.\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard talks to reporters in the Brady Press Briefing Room regarding her release of declassified documents related to the Russia hoax.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nSchiff served as the ranking member of the House intelligence committee from 2015 to 2019, before becoming the committee's chair from 2019 to 2023. In that role, he was kept up to date on classified materials surrounding the Russian collusion claims.\nTrump also recently invoked Gabbard's alleged revelations while attacking Schiff over his mortgages in another Truth Social post.\nFEDERAL HOUSING OFFICIAL SUBMITTED SCHIFF CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO DOJ OVER MORTGAGE DOCUMENTS\nTrump went on to ominously warn during a White House event last week that Schiff has \"a lot of other things far worse than\" his mortgage inquiry.\n\"He defrauded banks and insurance companies and the federal government, but it's, very simple. It's mortgage loan fraud ... But he has a lot of other things far worse than that. So no Adam Schiff, they have him 100% on mortgage fraud,\" Trump said last Tuesday from the White House while hosting a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\nJacobson said that Democrats have boxed themselves out of attempting to claim that Trump is targeting a political foe over the mortgage criminal referral because the party had spent the last decade launching \"lawfare\" at Trump.\n\"One of the ironies here that I think everybody understands, is that Democrats launched a lawfare campaign against Donald Trump. And it didn't just start once he took office this year. It's been going on for a decade,\" he said.\n\"They have used every tool available to try to destroy him, including through criminal prosecutions, including through federal investigations. . . . \u00a0They've really tried to get him. And for them now to say, 'oh, just because we did that to you for 10 years doesn't give you the right to do it to us.' Legally, that's sound. I mean, you have to prove your case in court. But politically, I don't think that's going to fly. Democrats screaming that Donald Trump is weaponizing prosecutors against them is not going to really impress a lot of people.\"\nPresident Donald Trump arrives on the South Lawn of the White House from Camp David on Monday, June 9, 2025.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc.)\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nJacobson speculated that there will likely be more woes for Schiff in the coming days, but that potential legal cases hinge on prosecutors.\n\"We don't know where this is going ahead, of course, but it does appear that Adam Schiff is in the sights of Donald Trump. No surprise about that, because Donald Trump has been in the sights of Adam Schiff for a decade. So, I fully expect that there will be more here. The question is going to be really though, once it moves into the realm of prosecution, what are the prosecutors going to do?\"\nThe Department of Justice declined comment when approached about potentially investigating and taking up the Schiff case.

Consumers have shown continued resiliency, boosting retail sales up 0.6% for the month of June. The labor market remains solid.\nAnd while the stock market isn\u2019t the economy per se, key market indices, including the broader-based S&P 500, continue to hit all-time highs.\nNormally, this would be very good news for a president\u2019s economic agenda. But given America\u2019s current fiscal situation, it is hindering one of PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s main focal points \u2013 the hope that the Fed will substantially lower its target interest rates.\nPresident Donald Trump listens during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, July 16, 2025.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nThe American fiscal situation is a precarious one, which has brought about several debt downgrades from the rating agencies, the last being in May, while U.S. debt is supposed to be the \"safe haven\" investment for the global financial system.\nLEFT'S TARIFF DOOMSDAY PREDICTIONS FALL FLAT AS TRUMP'S AMERICA THRIVES\nThe U.S. debt/GDP ratio is about double what most entities believe is a manageable and sustainable ceiling. Our deficit as a percentage of GDP is at wartime or deep recession levels, without the U.S. being at war or in a recession.\nAnd with such a heavy and growing debt load, now at $37 trillion, the interest cost on that debt is around $1 trillion, which is more than we spend on defense. Having debt financing costs exceed defense spending is not a signal of a healthy country.\nPresident Trump and his administration are rightfully focused on the excessive current interest cost on our debt. And, with more than $9 trillion in debt that has or needs to be refinanced this year, plus another couple trillion from new deficit spending, the cost of debt financing matters.\nThe higher the interest rates on Treasury debt, the higher the cost of financing and refinancing. That leads to higher deficits, and all else being equal, even higher interest rates as more debt needs to be financed. Wash, rinse and repeat and debt costs and deficits will keep going higher.\nSo, it is understandable that the president wants lower interest rates \u2013 even back to 1% or lower as he has recently mentioned. However, there are several challenges with that.\nINVISIBLE TAX: GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CRUSHING YOUR FINANCES\nBack to where we started, strong economic data and all-time highs in the market do not signal that interest rates are holding back economic activity. This makes it harder for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to justify rate cuts given their own mandate, although not impossible as their actions are often headscratchers.\nIt\u2019s also somewhat of a moot point, because the Fed\u2019s target rates directly impact what\u2019s called the short-end of the yield curve (aka short-dated securities like 1-month T-Bills, as an example). For the U.S. to term out its debt (refinance short-dated securities for a longer amount of time, like 10 years), the relevant yield is that of the longer-dated securities.\nWhile sometimes the Fed\u2019s rate has an indirect impact on those longer-dated securities, in recent times, it has not. In fact, we saw after the Fed rate cuts in the fall of 2024 that yields on 10-year Treasurys increased instead of decreased.\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that further cuts would have the desired effects, and could have other consequences, likere-stoking inflation.\nFor longer dated securities, the market sets the pricing, and supply and demand is front and center.\nYOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THE SOLUTION TO THE DEBT CRISIS, BUT HERE'S HOW TO FIX AMERICA'S SPENDING PROBLEM\nIt used to be that global central banks consistently increased their buying of U.S. Treasurys, but over the past decade or so, they have actually been net sellers, as countries around the world have been hurt by the mismanagement of theU.S. dollaras the world\u2019s reserve currency and are looking for ways to decrease their dependence upon it.\nSo, today\u2019s Treasury buyers are those focused on price, and with recent debt downgrades and concerns about the U.S.\u2019s fiscal foundation, they are demanding more of a premium to hold U.S. debt for longer periods of time.\nWith the U.S. continuing to run large deficits, adding more supply to this price-sensitive demand, all else equal, only drives up the yields and U.S. debt financing costs.\nSo, fiscal policy \u2013 which is managed by Congress, not theFed\u2019s monetary policy\u2013 is what\u2019s most critical today.\nThe Trump administration is currently looking at other ways to bring the interest rates down, impacting the demand side for Treasury.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe recently signed GENIUS Act may provide one avenue. TreasurySecretary Scott Bessenthas said, \"Recent reporting projects that stablecoins could grow into a $3.7 trillion market by the end of the decade. That scenario becomes more likely with passage of the GENIUS Act. A thriving stablecoin ecosystem will drive demand from the private sector for U.S. Treasuries, which back stablecoins.\"\nThis, if it comes to fruition, may help lower rates, although again, it may only increase demand for shorter duration Treasury securities.\nThere are a slew of other tools and opportunities that are likely forthcoming that can create other avenues of demand for Treasurys and help lower yields.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe tools available to the administration may be effective and lower rates, maybe even to the extremely low levels desired by the president. But it will only be a temporary solution if our deficits and debt problems aren\u2019t addressed. Furthermore, it may come with the cost of more inflation, as accommodative policies don\u2019t happen in a vacuum and have economic consequences.\nPowell and the Fed may not be willing to give on interest rates \u2013 at least at the levels the president is seeking \u2013 ifeconomic dataremains strong. President Trump will have other options, but they are only bandages. We will not a have a permanent solution until a concerted effort is made to fix our debt and deficits.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CAROL ROTH\nCarol Roth is a former investment banker, entrepreneur and author of the new book\"You Will Own Nothing\"Broadside Books.

They're not a cause, they're an effect.\"\nMamdani, positioning himself as a champion of the working class and someone who would address the housing crisis withpolicies like a rent freeze, doesn\u2019t address the actual problem.\nMAMDANI SILENT AFTER BORDER PATROL OFFICER ALLEGEDLY SHOT BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT IN NYC\nFox News Digital spoke to Manhattan Institute scholar John Ketcham about Zohran Mamdani's housing policies(Getty/Fox News Digital)\n\"Assembly member Mamdani's proposal to freeze the rent would only apply to the 1 million units of rent-stabilized apartments,\" Ketcham said. \"Now, these are units that can only increase in rents by an amount that the rent guidelines board determines and those members of the rent guidelines board are appointed by the mayor. So he would essentially appoint these members and direct them to keep rents stable.\"\nKetcham continued, \"Now, rents are already not covering increased operational costs for the owners of these rent-stabilized buildings and so the quality of the rent-stabilized housing stock is deteriorating rapidly and will continue to do so if the capital is not there to cover maintenance and operational costs. Roofs leak and boilers break. These things have to be fixed and there has to be enough in the rent increases to allow for these increased costs. If there isn't, then we're going to see a situation where tenants are living in worse and worse conditions each year.\"\nKetcham told Fox News Digital that the situation raises the question, \"Is that the type of city that we want to create?\"\n\"Or do we want a city where we have an abundance of new housing, where young people can feel like they have an option from among many different buildings and neighborhoods, where they can find the place that best suits their preferences and needs?\" Ketcham said.\nMAMDANI CONFRONTED ON STREETS OF NYC ABOUT 'COMMUNIST' LABEL, REFUSES TO ANSWER\nZohran Mamdani speaks with reporters as he leaves the Dirksen Senate Office Building on July 16, 2025 in Washington, D.C.(Michael M.

According to Ketcham, those residents are already \"truly suffering from gross mismanagement.\"\n\"It takes our public housing Authority, NYSHA, 413 days to complete a repair on average,\" Ketcham said. \"It's so bad that our far-left public advocate, Jumaane Williams, has repeatedly called NYSHA the worst landlord in the city. So these are issues where we're looking at what kind of city is New York going to be? Is it going to a place that rewards aspiration and that tries to attract newcomers who want to live in conditions that are getting better every year?

What does work is allowing the private sector to build a lot of new housing, including market-rate housing across the city and Mr. Mamdani's proposals are not necessarily amenable to that kind of private investment.

Peak demand is higher. Extreme weather more uncertain. Sources are more distributed.\nWhile our systems are strong,\u00a0the\u00a0pressures we're putting on it are unlike anything earlier generations ever imagined.\nBut this challenge can be a historic moment for huge progress, not just incremental improvements. It\u2019s why we are adding $100 million in investments and 700 new jobs over\u00a0the\u00a0next two years and expanding capacity at our leading\u00a0grid\u00a0solutions factories in Pennsylvania.\nSILICON, STEEL AND MEGAWATTS: CAN AMERICA CREATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO WIN THE AI RACE?\nThe\u00a0new roles and addedmanufacturing volumewill help support building more high-voltage switchgear products, critical components for stable and reliable operation of\u00a0the\u00a0nation\u2019s electrical\u00a0grids.\nEnergy-intensive, next-gen industries like high-tech manufacturing and AI will locate where\u00a0they can access reliable, efficient\u00a0power.

{"title": "Retailers caught red-handed using Trump's tariffs as cover for price gouging", "date": "2025-07-16", "body": "Council of Economic Advisors Chair Steve Miran joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss why tariffs have not prompted consumer prices to rise as President Donald Trump continues to broker deals with U.S. trading partners.\nIn recent weeks, headlines have been filled with warnings from major retailers about impending price hikes due totariffs reinstatedby President Donald Trump. Big Box stores likeWalmartand Target have been quick to suggest that tariffs on imported goods, particularly from China, have left them with no choice but to raise prices for American families.\nLet\u2019s be clear, these decisions are more about raising profit margins and going against Trump\u2019s agenda to bring costs down for Americans than responding to any actualeconomic pressure.\nTariffs are a strategic tool. TheTrump administration has always been clearabout that. Tariffs are designed to level the playing field, incentivize domestic production, counter predatory trade practices \u2013 especially from the Chinese Communist Party \u2013 and put America First. Tariffs protect long-term American interests, especially in vital industries like technology and manufacturing.\nTARIFF CASE PITS CATO INSTITUTE AGAINST TRUMP OVER \u2018UNLIMITED\u2019 EXECUTIVE POWER UNDER EMERGENCY LAW\nYet, many corporations are using tariffs as a convenient scapegoat to raise prices across the board, even on products not impacted by new trade policies. A recentFederal Reservereport found that retailers have increased prices on non-tariffed items, falsely implying that across-the-board cost pressures are tariff-driven. This is not only wrong, it\u2019s exploitative.\nSome retailers are raising prices on products and refusing to eat the increase despite White House urging.(Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images)\nWe all know many of these large retailers are sitting on comfortable, even expanded, profit margins because of the price hikes from COVID-19 that never came down. But it\u2019s not enough for them. They want to fleece the American consumer and blame it on President Trump\u2019s America First agenda.\nFormer Walmart CEO Bill SimonacknowledgedWalmart's capability to eat the costs of these tariffs rather than throwing the burden to the consumer: \"[T]his quarter they grew their gross profit margin in the US business 25 basis points \u2026 All that product that has the tariffs on it, they reported last quarter actually went down in price. That sort of gives them room in my view to manage any tariff impact that they would have.\"\nWHITE HOUSE DENIES TARIFFS PROMPTING INFLATION AS TRUMP PUSHES FOR TRADE DEALS\nDespite Simon\u2019s admission, Walmart has already issuedpricehikesunder the guise of tariff costs.\nWhat we\u2019re witnessing is a pattern of deflection. Rather than own up to their pricing strategies, many businesses are choosing to shift the blame onto the Trump administration\u2019s economic policy. This tactic is not only dishonest, it\u2019s harmful to public discourse. It creates the false impression that Trump administration policies are causing this, when in reality, many of these pricing decisions are being driven by corporate boards more concerned with shareholder satisfaction than consumer welfare.\nLet\u2019s be honest: these companies are not victims of President Trump\u2019s trade policy. They are powerful corporations who get to thrive in a free-market economy that the U.S. provides for them. But they\u2019re exploiting it. If they wanted to protect their customers from modest cost increases, they could. Instead, they\u2019re choosing to use tariffs, often on a small subset of goods, as an excuse to raise prices on a much larger range of products.\nTRUMP THREATENS 35% TARIFF ON CANADIAN GOODS OVER DANGEROUS CROSS-BORDER FENTANYL DISPUTE\nThe other fact the retailers consistently ignore is their role in why we need the tariffs to begin with. Major retailers have profited from the shift to outsourcing to China in recent decades. They should now bear the burden of the environment they helped create, and Americans agree.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe Protecting America Initiative, a conservative organization I work with that focuses on combating the threat of the CCP, recently polled general election voters and found that a majority of Americans are concerned that our nation\u2019s largest retailers are using tariffs as an excuse to hike prices.\nYet, many corporations are using tariffs as a convenient scapegoat to raise prices across the board, even on products not impacted by new trade policies.\nFifty-two percent of Americans also agree with Trump when he says retailers should bear the burden of any cost increases associated with the tariffs. Our data also shows that consumers want both government officials at the federal and state levels to implement accountability measures to stop retailers from artificially hiking prices.\nBRAZIL HITS BACK AT TRUMP\u2019S 50% TARIFF AS HE DECRIES \u2018WITCH HUNT\u2019 ON BOLSONARO FOR ALLEGED COUP ATTEMPT\nThe Trump administration is working hard to get costs down for American consumers and undo the economic mess that the autopen in Biden\u2019s White House left us with. By turning tariffs into a political talking point, some corporations are playing directly into the hands of our enemies, like China, which doesn\u2019t mind if American companies use tariffs as a scapegoat because it distracts from their unfair trade practices and puts pressure on the U.S. to back down.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Trump administration has never hidden the rationale for its tariff strategy. It's about America FIRST, national strength and economic independence. This is not a radical position, it\u2019s \u2013 as President Trump says \u2013 common sense. And it\u2019s supported by millions of Americans who understand that supporting\"Made in America\" manufacturingis vital for the future of our country.\nRetailers should stop hiding behind tariffs and start being honest with consumers. If you're raising prices, say so. But don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re being forced to act by government policy when the numbers say otherwise.

Gavin Newsom should visit Florida's \"Alligator Alcatraz\" and \"learn something\" during his tour of the new migrant detention facility.\nCalifornia Democrat Governor Gavin Newsomtook a page out ofDonald Trump\u2019s playbooklate in June by approving an overhaul of his state\u2019s costly and unnecessary environmental regulations.\nNewsom\u2019s signature updated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a 1970s-era law that forces developers and homeowners to undergo an absurdly expensive and long environmental review before starting any building project.\u00a0Among other things, the update streamlines the review process and exempts huge swaths of the state\u2019s infrastructure construction from the ancient regulatory statutes.\nCritics and the homebuilding industry have long blamed this cumbersome policy for California\u2019s long-runninghousing shortage,sky-high real estate prices, and even the state\u2019sinfamous homelessness problem.As a free-market economist, I applaud Newsom for defanging some of his state\u2019s most burdensome measures\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but he should go much further to a) help his constituents and b) shore up his national moderate bona fides as he likely runs for president in 2028.\nENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS COMPLAIN CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS HAVE 'BACKED DOWN' ON CLIMATE CHANGE\nFor example, his signature left the \"CEQA abuse\" loophole untouched. This is a regulation which allows labor unions and NIMBY (Not in My Backyard) activists to file frivolous environmental lawsuits that delay projects and run up development costs. Environmentalists often pretend these suits are about protecting animals and trees, but they\u2019re primarily a means of harming companies these radicals don\u2019t like.\nGov. Gavin Newsom made a good start on housing rules, but environmental lawsuits still pose a big problem. FILE: Newsom speaks at a news conference in Oakland, Calif.(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)\nAnd the radicals aren\u2019t just holding up signs. They\u2019re in elected offices, abusing their power for the sake of their agendas instead of serving constituents. That\u2019s what a court\u00a0ruled\u00a0in 2022 after two local governments stopped \"much-needed housing\" for decades. The court also said that CEQA was intended for narrow use, and that its abuse was holding up progress within the state, especially related to easing the problem of lowhousingsupply.\nThose lawsuits impact more than the rich company owners. They prevent young families from achieving the American Dream by making first homes too expensive to own and maintain. That\u2019s another piece of low-hanging regulatory fruit for Newsom, because his CEQA reform focused on urban apartments and large infrastructure projects\u00a0\u2013\u00a0important to millions of Californians, but also ignoring more structural reforms to the issue of expensive housing.\nSUPREME COURT LIMITS JUDGES' AUTHORITY TO BLOCK INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OVER ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS\nSince one of the primary drivers of California\u2019s population decline is the high cost of living, allowing developers to build more single-family homes would encourage more people to rent or buy the type of home they want to flee to \u2013 or did end up fleeing to. Many formerCaliforniaresidents might even return from affordable states like Texas, Arizona and Tennessee.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nFinally, there\u2019s trash collection. This one doesn\u2019t earn the same flashy headlines as environmental policy, crime or homelessness, but California has quietly (and expensively) been struggling in this area, too.\nThe California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) currently employs a Byzantine system of greenhouse gas emissions standards and penalty schemes that\u00a0squeeze privately owned landfills\u00a0without reducing the amount of trash to process.\nWATCH: BLUE-STATE REPUBLICAN 'THANKFUL' FOR MOVE TO SCRAP GAS-CAR BAN AS NEWSOM VOWS COURT FIGHT TO SAVE IT\nNot only does this force California taxpayers to cover the higher cost of transporting their garbage to faraway landfills, but it\u2019s put some landfills out of business. Late last year, theChiquita Canyon Landfillannounced that it would no longer be accepting waste, eliminating a critical option for Angelenos\u2019 trash disposal.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNewsom can\u2019t solve the entire landfill problem by himself, as many counties employ their own ridiculous landfill and environmental regulations. But his bully pulpit and influence with local and county lawmakers could get those entities to fall into line and create affordable waste disposal services for all those new homes.\nPeople vote with their feet, and millions of people have voted against California in recent decades by moving to more affordable states.

However, all that vertical space only takes up a footprint of just 13 by 13 feet. It's designed for tight urban plots orbackyard spaces, and instead of spreading out like a traditional mobile tiny home, it rises straight up.\nDQ Tower(Moduleform)\nThe ground floor opens up into a spacious living and dining area. A comfy sofa pulls double duty as both seating and an optional spare sleeping space. A comfortable dining nook sits next to a kitchenette complete with an induction stove, sink, and refrigerator. The floor-to-ceiling glass windows give plenty of natural light and open up the space even further. The ground floor rounds out with a half bathroom with a convenient washing machine included.\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\nClimbing the staircase to the second floor, you will find the first cozy bedroom complete with a single bed and a built-in wardrobe. On the second floor is also a full bathroom with a standing shower. And yes, the ceilings are quite tall and spacious, avoiding the cramped loft designs of other tiny homes.\nThe third floor is the showstopper. As you ascend the steel and wood staircase, the master bedroom sits comfortably with a double bed, an even larger wardrobe, and a small desk for a working area. The tall windows up here continue to provide light and ventilation, making the most of the compact space while providing breathtaking views.\nDQ Tower(Moduleform)\nIn total, the DQ Tower offers nearly 420 square feet of living space. That is a reasonable accommodation for a couple or small family, or anyone who appreciates the efficiency of downsizing. Another option, and one that the manufacturers advertise, is the DQ Tower, which fits comfortably in the backyard, making for a cost-effective and low-impact guest house, perfect for rental sites like Airbnb.\u00a0 And with two bathrooms and two bedrooms, it's surprisingly livable for such a small footprint.\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\nThe major convenience and cost-cutting feature of these tiny tower homes is thatthey come prefabricated. They are built off-site in Germany, transported to the site, and settled into place with a small crane crew. As of now, it takes about eight months from order to delivery. The whole structure is constructed with a sturdy steel frame, well-insulated walls, and clad in chic aluminum panels.\nDQ Tower(Moduleform)\nThe starting price for these private towers is currently roughly $176,000. \u00a0 Now, that is nearly twice the per-square-foot cost of other tiny homes. However, the DQ Tower offers ultra-high-quality, designer-level micro-living with a sleek and accommodating design.\nThe DQ Tower is more than just a tiny home. It offers a bold vision for how people can live in smaller spaces without giving up comfort or style.

Predictably, liberal media outlets \u2013 led by CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post \u2013 continue to insist the OBBB will add trillions of dollars to our national debt.\nThe truth \u2013 backed by both historical experience and robust economic analysis \u2013 is the exact opposite. President Trump\u2019s OBBB will not onlyboost jobs and take-home payfor America\u2019s working-class families.\u00a0It will\u00a0slash deficits by trillions of dollars even as its targeted expenditures will strengthen our national defense and secure our borders.\u00a0As a bonus, OBBB will rapidly\u00a0accelerate the deportation of millions of illegal aliens now stealing jobs from American citizens and driving down wages.\nAt the center of the Fake News misinformation storm is the Congressional Budget Office.\u00a0For years, the CBO has been trapped in a stale left-wing Keynesian mindset and stubbornly committed to static scoring models that fail to grasp how real-world economies respond to bold, pro-growth policies. As someone who has witnessed President Trump craft his economic agenda from inside the West Wing, I can tell you firsthand: when you cut taxes, slash job-killing regulations, achieve energy dominance, defend America\u2019s manufacturing base with tariffs and fight for fair trade, the economy doesn\u2019t just inch forward \u2013 it takes off.\nPresident Donald Trump during a dinner with Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, in the Blue Room of the White House on Monday, July 7, 2025.

I was there when the CBO confidently projected a return to a sleepy Obama-Biden \"new normal\" 1.8\u20132.0% trend growth. But what actually\u00a0happened?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' WILL UNLEASH PARALLEL PROSPERITY\nIn 2018, real GDP roared ahead at\u00a02.9%. Business investment surged. Hundreds of billions in overseas profits came home. Small businesses and consumers finally felt like Washington had their backs \u2013 and they responded by spending, investing and hiring. All of this completely blindsided the bean counters at CBO, who missed the wave of innovation and confidence that Trump\u2019s policies ignited.\nComes now CBO 2.0 \u2013 once again stumbling into the Trump policy arena with its trademark combination of backward-looking modeling and partisan blind spots. Instead of learning from its spectacular misfire on theTrump 2017 tax bill, the CBO is now recycling the same flawed assumptions to smear the fiscal integrity of President Trump\u2019s One Big, Beautiful Bill \u2013 and the Fake News is eating it up.\nHere's how the tired old misinformation act of the CBO has unfolded: At the outset of scoring the OBBB, the CBO defaulted to its static methodology. As in 2017, it assumed a chronically underwhelming annual real GDP growth rate of just1.8%\u2013the same stale figure it has clung to for over a decade, regardless of the supply-side reforms at play. Unsurprisingly, the result of theCBO\u2019s debut analysisof OBBB was a headline-grabbing forecast of $3.9 trillion added to the national debt over the next 10 years.\nOf course, this initial forecast came under withering fire for two glaring omissions. First, as in 2017, it ignored the dynamic growth effects baked into the OBBB\u2019s permanent tax cuts, deregulatory measures, and investment incentives. Second, it refused to account for the revenue-generating power of Trump\u2019s tariff policy, which the White House projects will generate as much as $2.8 trillion over the same decade.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nUnder heavy fire, the CBO scrambled to release a\u00a0second \"dynamic\" estimate \u2013 but once again, they blew it. This time, they cooked the books by frontloading the bill\u2019s costs, artificially inflating the early debt load. That let them assume a spike in interest rates, which then conveniently wiped out the very growth their model was supposed to measure. It was a masterclass in bureaucratic sabotage disguised as fiscal analysis.\nTo wit: When you frontload spending \u2013 particularly on growth-oriented tax relief and business investment incentives \u2013 you should also frontload the growth surge those policies trigger. More investment, more jobs and more productivity from this dynamic growth surge translate into higher revenues and lower debt burdens, not higher. And with reduced borrowing needs, interest rates should fall \u2013 not rise \u2013 as the market prices in stronger fiscal sustainability.\nHad the CBO conducted an intellectually honest dynamic analysis AND accurately accounted for the Trump tariffs, it would have forecast a massivemultitrillion-dollar surplus, NOT an equally massive increase in the debt.

{"title": "Teachers union reveals true colors behind closed doors at annual convention", "date": "2025-07-10", "body": "National Education Association President Becky Pringle defended illegal immigrants during a protest against immigration raids that occurred throughout the city.\nThe National Education Association (NEA),the nation\u2019s largest teachers union, just held its annual convention in Portland, Oregon, and laid bare its transformation into a brazenly political organization. Far from prioritizing the education of America\u2019s children, the NEA\u2019s agenda was a parade of partisan resolutions, misspelled attacks on political opponents, and a clear alignment with the far-left wing of the Democratic Party.\nThe tone was set byAshlie Crosson, the NEA\u2019s 2025 Teacher of the Year,who declared on July 4th that her job is \"deeply political\" and always has been. \"Once I realized how deeply political our profession had always been, I knew I could no longer stay on the sidelines,\" Crosson said. The irony of this statement on Independence Day was not lost, as the NEA proved itself anything but independent. Instead, it revealed itself as a loyal foot soldier for progressive causes, far removed from the needs of students or the concerns ofparents.\nThe convention\u2019s resolutions \u2013 which were leaked to me by an NEA conference attendee \u2013 were a masterclass in political overreach. One business item called for the NEA to \"defend against Trump\u2019s embrace of fascism by using the term facism [sic] in NEA materials to correctly characterize Donald Trump\u2019s program and actions.\" Yes, the union that claims to represent educators couldn\u2019t even spell \"fascism\" correctly in its official resolution attacking the president. The irony is almost too rich to parody.\nNATIONAL 'TEACHER OF THE YEAR' RECIPIENT FEELS JOB IS 'DEEPLY POLITICAL'\nThe NEA didn\u2019t stop there. Another resolution labeled any move toeliminate the U.S. Department of Educationas an \"illegal, anti-democratic, and racist attempt to destroy public education and privatize it in the interests of the billionaires.\" Calling the abolition of a federal bureaucracy \"racist\" is absurd, especially when theDepartment of Education\u2019strack record has failed low-income minority students for decades. If anything, the department\u2019s one-size-fits-all approach has entrenched disparities, trapping kids in failing schools based on their ZIP codes.\nThe NEA openly supports leftist politics and its latest convention was just more proof. FILE: President Becky Pringle speaks at the Philadelphia delegation on July 4, 2024.(YouTube/screenshot)\nImmigration policy, another topic far afield from teaching math or reading, also took center stage. The NEA adopted a resolution to \"defend birthright citizenship and oppose the attempt to revert to pre-civil rights movement \u2013 Jim Crow \u2013 legal concepts of \u2018states rights\u2019 in order to deny citizenship to the children of immigrants.\" The union went further, supporting students\u2019 \"right to dissent and organize against Trump\u2019s policies\" and \"against ICE raids and deportations.\"\nThe NEA\u2019s resolutions also took aim at parental rights. In response to theSupreme Court\u2019s Mahmoud v. Taylor ruling,which allows parents to opt their children out of gender ideology instruction, the NEA adopted a business item signaling its intent to keep pushing such content in classrooms. This defiance of parental choice shows a union more interested in indoctrination than education. Similarly, the NEA passed a resolution supporting \"the mass democratic movement against Trump\u2019s authoritarianism and violations of human rights,\" further cementing its role as a political activist group rather than an advocate for teachers or students.\nDEMOCRATS SHOULD 'BREAK UP' WITH RANDI WEINGARTEN, EX-HARRIS CAMPAIGN AIDE ARGUES\nPerhaps most puzzling was the NEA\u2019s decision to \"not use, endorse, or publicize any materials from theAnti-Defamation League (ADL),\"an organization founded to combat antisemitism. Why single out a group dedicated to fighting hate? This move raises serious questions about the union\u2019s priorities and sends a troubling message at a time when antisemitism is on the rise.\nThe NEA\u2019s political bias is not new. Nearly all its political contributions go to Democrats every election cycle, making it less a union and more a money-laundering operation for the Democratic Party. With over $380 million in annual revenue, the NEA has plenty of resources to push its agenda. This one-sided partisanship is particularly galling given the NEA\u2019s unique status as the only union in the nation with a federal charter, granted over a century ago. This special privilege, bestowed by Congress, is no longer justified for an organization so blatantly partisan. Lawmakers should revoke this charter immediately.\nThe NEA\u2019s priorities are so misaligned that in 2019, it rejected a resolution to \"rededicate itself to the pursuit of increased student learning in every public school in America.\" Let that sink in: a teachers union explicitly refused to prioritize student learning. Instead, it has quadrupled down on its war on education, turning classrooms into activist training grounds.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe NEA\u2019s actions echo the words of Horace Mann, the father of public education, who said, \"We who are engaged in the sacred cause of education are entitled to look upon all parents as having given hostages to our cause.\" The NEA seems to agree, treating children as tools for its political projects rather than individuals deserving a quality education.\nTEACHERS UNION BOSSES SPLIT OVER SUPREME COURT RULING ON PARENTAL RIGHTS TO SHIELD KIDS FROM LGBTQ CONTENT\nThe consequences of this politicization are clear. Only about a quarter of American eighth graders are proficient in math, and reading scores are similarly dismal. Yet the NEA remains focused on partisan crusades rather than addressing these failures.\nThe union went further, supporting students\u2019 \"right to dissent and organize against Trump\u2019s policies\" and \"against ICE raids and deportations.\"\nThis radical agenda is free advertising for school choice and homeschooling. Parents are rightly alarmed by a union that sees their children as \"hostages\" to its cause. Since 2019, there has been amass exodus from union-controlled public schools,over a million families opting for charter schools, private schools or homeschooling. The NEA\u2019sPortlandconvention only accelerates this trend, as parents seek educational options that prioritize learning over politics.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nTeachers deserve a union that fights for their professional interests, not one that uses their dues to fund partisan agendas. Parents deserve schools that focus on reading, writing, and arithmetic, not activism. And students deserve an education that prepares them for life, not one that conscripts them into ideological battles.\nUntil the NEA returns to its core mission, it will continue to lose members, credibility and public trust. Lawmakers should start by voting to revoke its federal charter, and parents should keep voting with their feet.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM COREY DeANGELIS\nDeAngelis is a senior fellow at the American Culture Project and a senior advisor at Accuracy in Media.

What were Republicans going to say, never mind, we just tanked the president's main legislative priority because we didn't like this or that?\nThey didn't need Democratic votes, under so-called reconciliation. And Trump controls the GOP. So its members fell into line.\nNow the question is why, through this successful stretch, has Trump continued to draw such negative coverage?\nTRUMP SIGNS 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL' BILL IN SWEEPING VICTORY FOR SECOND TERM AGENDA, OVERCOMING DEMS AND GOP REBELS\nFor starters, many in the media just can\u2019t stand the guy. And this has largely been true since 2015. So anything that helps him must be wrong and must be denigrated.\nEven the successful strikeon Irandrew only scattered instances of grudging praise, when under any other president there would have been standing ovations.\nThe press immediately reframed this as a debate over whether the bunker-busting bombs had only set back Iran\u2019s nuclear program by a few months.\nThe press' scant praise over Trump's Iran strikes quickly devolved into debate over how far they really set back Tehran's nuclear program.(Planet Labs PBC via AP)\nIn fairness, that\u2019s what the preliminary, classified Intel report leaked to the press said. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with reporting that accurately, even though the assessment was made with low confidence.\nBut Trump wants reporters for CNN and the New York Times, which broke the story, fired over this, and with anFBI leak probeunder way, says he may force journalists to reveal their confidential sources.\nOnce the White House could no longer blame anonymous sources, there is nothing wrong with quoting a government report \u2013 even if if turns out to be wrong.\nThe cease-fire between Israel and Iran was fine, but that quickly morphed into chatter about why Trump couldn\u2019t pull off an end to the fighting between Israel and Hamas, a far more difficult task.\nAFTER SETBACK TO IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM, TRUMP EXPECTED TO LEVERAGE MILITARY SUPPORT IN NETANYAHU MEETING\nNot to mention his freezing of weapons shipments to Ukraine, when despite his \"very disappointing\" call withVladimir Putin, who promptly unleashed the biggest drone and missile attack against Kyiv since the illegal invasion of its sovereign neighbor.\nPerhaps the president is learning what has been obvious to the rest of us: Putin has no conceivable interest in peace.\nEveryone had to report the stock market surge, though not with the enthusiasm of the earlier plunge, and Trump yesterday announced that he\u2019d hit Japan and South Korea, two allies, with a 25 percent hike in tariffs. But they don\u2019t take effect till Aug. 1, so this could just be another negotiating tactic.\nThere was also next to zero coverage of Trump's $16 million settlement with Paramount.(Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nThere was almost no television coverage of Trump\u2019s $16 million settlement with Paramount, which is nothing more than the news business protecting its own. If this had been any other kind of company \u2013 with the backstory that someone like Shari Redstone needed administration approval to sell the company and pocket $2 billion \u2013 the press would have gone haywire.\nNow there\u2019s a new twist. Fox\u2019s Charlie Gasparino,writing for the New York Post, reported the Paramount settlement includes a side deal between Trump and for the buyer David Ellison, son of tech mogul Larry Ellison, for him to run $15 to $20 million in advertising supporting causes backed by the president.\nAnd Trump confirmed it.\n\"We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million, or maybe more than that in advertising,\" he told reporters.\nParamount denied any knowledge of the side deal.\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\nThe president has also been drawn into a war of words withElon Musk, calling him a \"train wreck\" who\u2019s gone \"off the rails\" in forming a third party and raising the Epstein files again. Musk says the lack of an Epstein client list is the \"final straw\" \u2013 he had once apologized for raising it \u2013 and there\u2019s no difference between the Republican and Democratic parties.\nBut there was one moment, in my view, that was a misstep by Trump.\nThe president had no need to negotiate with Democrats, who strongly opposed a tax cut tilted toward the wealthy while making deep cuts to Medicaid.\n\"Every Democrat in Congress voted against the \u2018Big, Beautiful Bill\u2026They wouldn\u2019t vote only because they hate Trump, but I hate them, too, you know?

Unfortunately,\u00a0environmental\u00a0zealots don\u2019t seem to understand this inherent problem with their agenda. Or worse, they simply don\u2019t care.\nActivists participate in a protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline on March 10, 2017, in Washington, D.C.

Spain is a pertinent example.\nIn April, the\u00a0country bragged\u00a0that for the first time, it was running\u00a0on\u00a0100% renewable energy. Later that month, a grid failure created a nationwide blackout that risked lives and\u00a0cost the country nearly a half-billion dollars.\nGenerating electricity solely through renewables makes electric grids more prone to collapse, and requires incredibly expensive upgrades to energy infrastructure that leads to higher electricity prices for consumers.\nTHE PREDICTABLE OUTCOME OF CALIFORNIA\u2019S GREEN ENERGY POLICIES HAS ARRIVED AND IT'S A DISASTER\nThe\u00a0International Energy Agency found\u00a0that for every 10% increase in the portion of electricity generated by renewables, costs go up by more than 4 cents per kilowatt hour. As a result, countries like Germany pay more than 2.5 times the average electricity rate than the United States, and over four times higher than China.\nWhen countries likeChina or Russiacan generate electricity more cheaply than their democratic rivals, they gain an important economic advantage. China\u2019s coal consumption\u00a0reached record highs\u00a0last year, and its buildout of new coal power plants reached the\u00a0highest level of construction\u00a0in the last 10 years. Russia is the\u00a0world\u2019s second-largest exporter of natural gas\u00a0and holds natural gas reserves that rival the U.S.\nWhen it comes to the environment, these countries are not extracting or using fossil fuels with the same care as American companies. In fact, the\u00a0largest carbon emitter\u00a0in the world by a long shot is China. In 2020, China\u2019s emissions\u00a0exceeded those of all other developed nations\u00a0combined. As China andRussiacontinue to develop their fossil fuel resources, it will be essential that the United States do the same.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nGroups\u00a0like Greenpeace may continue their efforts to derail American fossil fuel projects, but policymakers should recognize that this agenda would have little impact\u00a0on\u00a0the environment and a lasting and damaging impact\u00a0on\u00a0both U.S.\u00a0national\u00a0security\u00a0and economic competitiveness.\nTo protect the environment and preserve our democratic values, the United States must pursue an energy policy rooted in realism, not ideology.

You're going to save more money, you're going to keep more of your hard-earned money, and that's not going away.

President Trump won in a landslide victory by offering powerful solutions to each of these problems. He is the American people's declaration of independence from business as usual in Washington.\nThe president seeks to serve \"the forgotten men and women of America.\" And theOne Big, Beautiful Bill, which he signs into law today, is central to that mission. This historic legislation will make life more affordable for all Americans by unleashing parallel prosperity\u2014the idea that Main Street and Wall Street can grow together.\nNEW PROJECTION SIGNALS GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, WORKERS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'\nThe One Big, Beautiful Bill represents the priorities of the new Republican Party, which includes millions of working-class Americans who once called themselves Democrats. This bill builds on the blue-collar renaissance started by President Trump.\nSince President Trump took office in January, blue-collar wages have increased 1.7%. This represents the largest increase in working-class wages to start a presidency in more than 50 years. For comparison, working-class wages decreased during the same period under every single president since Richard Nixon with only one exception\u2014President Trump in his first term.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes President Trump's 'One Big, Beautiful Bill' will unleash an economic boom.(Getty Images/Photo illustration)\nKey to sparking the president\u2019s second blue-collar boom has been his efforts to end illegal immigration. The open-border policy of previous administrations accelerated our nation\u2019s affordability crisis. The influx of millions of illegal aliens put an unsustainable strain on healthcare, housing, education and welfare. It also supported a black market in labor that artificially suppressed working-class wages for decades. But that ends with the One Big Beautiful Bill.\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill is more than just a tax bill. It works to ensure that illegal immigrants are not taking advantage of the safety net created for Americans. The bill also funds the completion of the border wall and provides resources to hire thousands of additional federal agents to protect our country against future illegal immigration. The goal is to redirect the estimated $249 billion inannualwagespaid to illegal workers to lawful workers and American citizens. Ending the black market of undocumented labor by funding enforcement of our existing immigration laws will result in a massive pay raise for the working class.\nUS President Donald Trump arrives to speak on his policy to end tax on tips in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 25, 2025. After visits to disaster sites in North Carolina and California, the Vegas stop is more of a feel-good victory lap, as he lays out his plans to exclude tips from federal taxes -- an enormously popular move in a city built on the hospitality industry.(MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)\nWe have seen American workers benefit from the president\u2019s economic approach before. Under President Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, the net worth of the bottom 50% of households increased faster than the net worth of the top 10% of households. That will happen again under the One Big Beautiful Bill.\nThe billprevents a $4.5 trillion tax hikeon the American people. This will allow the average worker to keep an additional $4,000 to $7,200 in annual real wages and allow the average family of four to keep an additional $7,600 to $10,900 in take-home pay. Add to this the president\u2019s ambitious deregulation agenda, whichcouldsave the average family of four an additional $10,000. For millions of Americans, these savings are the difference between being able to make a mortgage payment, buy a car, or send a child to college.\nThe president is delivering on his promise to seniors as well. The bill provides an additional $6,000 deduction for seniors,which will meanthat 88% of seniors receiving Social Security income will pay no tax on their Social Security benefits.\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill also codifies no tax on tips and no tax on overtime pay\u2014both policies designed to provide financial relief to America\u2019s working class. These tax breaks will ensure Main Street workers keep more of their hard-earned income. And they will bolster productivity by rewarding Americans who work extra hours. All Americans can learn how President Trump\u2019s tax cuts will impact their lives for the better witha new White House calculator.\nThese productivity-enhancing measures dovetail with the second booster in the blue-collar boom: providing 100% expensing for new factories and existing factories that expand operations, plus car loan interest deductibility to support Made-in-America.\nEconomic security is national security. This became especially clear during COVID, which exposed glaring vulnerabilities in our critical supply chains. By providing 100% expensing for factories\u2014in addition to rebalancing trade to encourage greater domestic production\u2014President Trump is fortifying our supply chains and reawakening the might of America\u2019s industrial base.\nTo help fuel this effort, the president is unleashing American energy by removing onerous regulations, increasing oil and gas lease sales, eliminating the perverse subsidies of the Green New Scam, and refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. These measures will make life more affordable for American families by bringing down the costs of gas and electricity across the country.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThrough the One Big Beautiful Bill, President Trump is taking a bottom-up approach to restoring the economy. To that end, the bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent to give businesses of all sizes the certainty they need to grow, hire, and plan for the long term. It also provides targeted relief for small businesses by more than doubling the cap on overall small business expensing. These tax provisions will put billions of dollars back in the hands of America\u2019s small business owners, which they can then use to expand their workforce and reinvigorate Main Street.\nThe intent of all these policies\u2014be it tax cuts for the working class, full expensing for manufacturers, or new deductions for small businesses\u2014is the same: to improve the lives of Americans on every rung of the economic ladder. With visionary leadership, President Trump is laying the foundation for the Golden Age he promised through tax deals, trade deals, peace deals, and deregulation.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill will Make America Affordable Again.

These wins are not abstract. They are personal, tangible, and powerful.\nLet\u2019s start with taxes. For the last several years, millions of families have benefited from lower individual tax rates that helped stretch paychecks further and keep small businesses afloat. But those cuts were set to expire. Had Congress failed to act, families across the country would have faced a surprise tax hike in the middle of an already uncertain economy.

For too long, Uncle Sam took a bite out of every extra effort. With this new law, overtime pay and tips will no longer be taxed. That money stays in workers\u2019 pockets, where it belongs.\nOur main street members understand thatrewarding hard workis not just good policy, it is common sense. This provision alone gives frontline Republicans a powerful contrast against the bureaucratic mindset that says Washington always knows best. Voters know who had their back, and who tried to block this relief.\nThen there\u2019s thechild tax credit. Expanding it was a priority for our members because families are the backbone of every community. Under this bill, more parents qualify, and the benefit reaches further into the middle class. Whether it's used for groceries, childcare, or saving for the future, this credit will make a difference in homes across America. It is direct, it is simple, and it shows that main street Republicans are putting families first.\nMake no mistake, our members took tough votes to get this done.

Not talking points. Real, reform that helps the people they represent.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThat is the power of this moment.

No way it\u2019s that much.\"\nI had just taught my high school seniors in U.S. government class about budgets and national debts and asked, \"How much money do you think we owe? How much is ournational debt?\"\nTheir ridiculous responses, ranging from millions to billions to $1 trillion, are funny but also sad. Finally, I can't listen anymore and, feeling like the evil queen giving Snow White the poisoned apple, tell them: \"$37 trillion dollars.\"\nINVISIBLE TAX: GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CRUSHING YOUR FINANCES\nThere\u2019s a stunned silence.\nI then walk around the room with my hand out and start shaking students' hands, each time saying, \"Thank you.\" They look at me, confused.

But it was not until this moment that they finally understood what it really meant \u2013 and what it will mean for them. Many of them are worried they\u2019ll incurstudent loan debt \u2013they were unaware of the other debt they\u2019re inheriting.\nI putusdebtclock.orgup, along with a photo of my granddaughter playing in our back yard, and ask, \"How much does she owe?\"\nIt takes them a minute, but they find the \"Debt per citizen\" section \u2013 $108,010. She is 3 years old.\nOf more immediate interest for them is \"Debt per taxpayer,\" since some have already begun paying taxes, and most others will soon. That's $323,051.\nYOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THE SOLUTION TO THE DEBT CRISIS, BUT HERE'S HOW TO FIX AMERICA'S SPENDING PROBLEM\nI say, \"Look at that debt clock \u2013 what is the worst number on there? Not the highest, theworst.\"\nAfter a couple minutes, I direct their attention to the section, \"Interest on the debt.\" It\u2019s a little over a trillion dollars a year.\nTheir ridiculous responses, ranging from millions to billions to $1 trillion, are funny but also sad. Finally, I can't listen anymore and, feeling like the evil queen giving Snow White the poisoned apple, tell them: \"$37 trillion dollars.\"\n\"What does that money buy?\" one of them asks. I take a piece of scrap paper off my desk, crumple it, hold it up, and say: \"To the taxpayer, it's worth exactly as much as this crumpled paper. That money doesn't build a single hospital or school or bridge. It doesn't build a single bomber or manufacture a single bullet.\"\nI show them that in July of 2020 debt service was only $386 billion a year and the national debt was $26 trillion. I ask why would debt service be 2.6 times as high now when the national debt is \"only\" 1.4 times as high. The answer is that interest rates have gone up, greatly increasing the interest we pay on the debt.\nCLASS DISMISSED: COLLEGES EXPECTED TO CLOSE AS ENROLLMENT NUMBERS TANK\nThe students try to come up with solutions. \"Why not just pay it by printing more money?\"\nI explain hyperinflation and pass around a couple 100 million Deutsche Mark bills from Germany in 1923. I tell the story of a German woman filling an old wheelbarrow with Deutsche Marks, going to the store, leaving it outside for a moment while she selected some bread and milk, then coming back to find the old wheelbarrow gone--and the worthless bills dumped out in the street.\nWe watch the 2009 Onion satirical video \"U.S. Government Stages Fake Coup To Wipe Out National Debt\" in which a newscaster informs viewers:\n\"The White House today enacted an emergency plan to eliminate all the United States\u2019 financial obligations to foreign nations by faking a violent coup of the American government \u2026the fake coup began at 10 a.m. today, when fake rebel leader Octavius Del Monte stormed Congress, pretended to kill several congressmen \u2026 then said \u2018Hear my words China, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates.

Josh Hawley, who is bafflingly pushing an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15/hour with additional increases indexed to inflation.\nIf wages could be raised by mandate without negative consequences, why would we stop there? Why not make the minimum wage $100/hour, $100,000/hour or even a cool $1 million/hour?\nZohran Mamdani, mayoral candidate for New York City, speaks at a rally held by the Working Families Party at Foley Square in New York City, May 10, 2025.(Reuters/Bing Guan)\nBecause in real life, that\u2019s not the way things work.\nTRUMP\u2019S \u2018ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL\u2019 COULD CEMENT ECONOMIC LEGACY FOR DECADES\nThe minimum wage has always been an evil policy, rooted in racism. It was passed as legislation precisely to exclude unskilled workers, particularly immigrants, minorities and women, from the workforce. It has the same effect today.\nBut the financially illiterate don\u2019t seem to understandbasic economics.\nThe minimum wage is not an average wage, median wage, maximum wage or even an expected wage. It is quite literally a floor (although, as economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, the real minimum wage is zero). As reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (\"BLS\") via FRED, only 1% of workers report being paid at or below the federal minimum wage, and that data is \"based solely on the hourly wage they report (which does not include overtime pay, tips or commissions).\"\nLEFT, LEFTER AND LEFTIST: DEMOCRATS COULD BE DEFINED BY RADICAL, BIG CITY MAYORS\nSen. Josh Hawley asks questions during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Jan. 15, 2025.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\nThe minimum wage is heavily slanted toward teens and workersentering the workforcewith few skills. As the BLS noted, \"Minimum wage workers tend to be young. Although workers under age 25 represented one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they accounted for 43% of those paid the federal minimum wage or less.\"\nWhile minimum wage directly impacts a small number of individuals, its effects ripple throughout the economy at large. If teens and unskilled workers have a guaranteed wage floor, those with skills and experience will want to be compensated even more.\nThat increases bothwages and taxes paidfor a business throughout their labor force, as well as that of all their suppliers, adding substantially to operating costs and reducing what may already be slim operating margins. The businesses will either have to make less money or pass on costs to consumers \u2013 or both.\nThis makes products and services more expensive and, in many cases, will put businesses out of business across the economy as every company now competes in a market where nonskilled workers have a high fixed cost set by government.\nNEW YORK'S SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE IS JUST BEGINNING BUT THERE'S STILL A WAY OUT\nSometimes, businesses will also reduce product sizes or service offerings \u2013 shrinkflation, as we saw under the last administration \u2013 but one way or another, that increase in labor cost flows through the economy and impacts what you are able to get for your dollars.\nIt\u2019s notable that small business owners, who often work well in excess of 40 hours of week and risk their own capital, don\u2019t get a guaranteed wage, but politicians are happy to make entrepreneurial effortsmore risky and costly.\nThe minimum wage, particularly the federal proposals, don\u2019t take into account different economic costs by region or geographic area, either.\nJust because bad policy exists doesn\u2019t mean that we should keep doubling down on it. Pay should be negotiated between parties based on value and demand for skills and services.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAn economy cannot function without being able to get people into the workforce and trained. We need to keep jobs where people can enter the workforce, learn skills and, if desired, move on in their career paths.\nAt a time whenAI is threatening jobs, and technology is replacing workers, enacting legislation that incentivizes fewer jobs and makes it more costly and difficult to run a business is patently insane.\nWages will naturally shift with the market for labor, as we have seen in recent years.

Laura Gillen, D-N.Y., reacts to Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani winning New York City\u2019s mayoral primary race.\nSocialist Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, is facing criticism over a campaign policy document that explicitly calls for shifting the city\u2019s tax burden onto \"richer and whiter neighborhoods.\"\nMamdani caused a political earthquake in this week\u2019s primary, trouncing former New York Gov.Andrew Cuomoin a stunning upset, all but securing his place on the November ballot. Housing affordability has been a central pillar of his campaign.\nApolicy documenttitled \"Stop the Squeeze on NYC Homeowners\" from Mamdani\u2019s mayoral campaign website argues that the city\u2019s current property tax system disproportionately benefits wealthy, White homeowners, particularly in Manhattan and affluent areas of Brooklyn, by allowing them to pay far less in taxes due to outdated assessment caps.\nZohran Mamdani speaking and a leafy neighborhood.(Theodore Parisienne for New York Daily News ;Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nCITY-RUN GROCERY STORES, DEFUNDING POLICE, SAFE INJECTION SITES: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT NYC'S NEXT POTENTIAL MAYOR\nIn contrast, Black, Latino and immigrant homeowners in neighborhoods like Brownsville and Jamaica in the outer borough of Queens are overburdened and at higher risk of foreclosure.\nHis solution?\n\"Shift the tax burden from overtaxed homeowners in the outer boroughs to more expensive homes in richer and whiter neighborhoods,\" the proposal reads. \"The property tax system is unbalanced because assessment levels are artificially capped, so homeowners in expensive neighborhoods pay less than their fair share.\"\nThe proposal would reduce the taxable portion of assessed property values citywide, and offset that by raising actual tax rates in wealthier areas. The result: lower tax bills for lower-income neighborhoods and higher ones for affluent areas \u2014 which the campaign describes as \"richer and whiter.\"\nThe racial component of the policy position has come in for criticism online, with broadcaster Mark Levinsharing a New York Poststory about the proposal and writing \"Oh, and Mamdani is racist, too.\"\nPolitical commentator Eric Daugherty also brandished it as explicitly \"racist\" on X, while the New York Post editorial board also slammed the proposal as \"pure racism.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Mamdani\u2019s campaign for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\nThe campaign document also highlights racial disparities in deed theft and \"tangled titles,\" which are situations where someone lives in a home they believe they own \u2014 often through inheritance \u2014 but their name is not on the deed, creating legal uncertainty about ownership.\nThe document states that predominantly Black neighborhoods face these challenges at much higher rates than White neighborhoods.\nTo address this, Mamdani is proposing a $10 million \"Tangled Title Fund\" to help city residents hire lawyers and clear legal titles so they can secure full homeownership rights and benefits.\nREPUBLICANS USE MAMDANI BOMBSHELL VICTORY OVER CUOMO AS AMMUNITION TO BLAST DEMOCRATS AS EXTREMISTS\nMamdani is a member of theDemocratic Socialists of America, whose preamble discusses a way to \"end white supremacy and racial oppression because its destruction is in the interest of all workers, including white workers.\"\nOverall, the housing document frames the city\u2019s housing inequities as structurally racist and economically unjust.\nThe document also claims that the city\u2019s tax lien sale system is exploitative and racist. When a homeowner falls behind on property taxes under the system, the city sells that debt to a private trust of Wall Street-backed investors, usually at a discount. instead of collecting the debt directly.\n\"The tax lien sale has been particularly harmful to Black, brown, and working-class homeowners, leading many homeowners to lose their home to foreclosure, or forcing them to sell below market value in order to pay off their accumulating debts,\" the document reads. \"The city is six times more likely to sell a tax lien in a Black neighborhood than a white neighborhood. This policy is extracting wealth from Black, brown, and working-class communities and stripping New Yorkers of their homes.\"\nZohran Mamdani, New York City mayoral candidate, speaks during an election night event in New York on June 25, 2025.(Christian Monterrosa/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMamdani said he will end the system on his first day in office and create a new tax collection system that provides \"additional opportunities\" for homeowners to enter into payment plans, pay down their debt and stay in their homes.\nThe Queens assemblyman wants to build 200,000 new publicly-subsidized affordable homes and immediately freeze rents for the city\u2019s 2.4 million stabilized tenants.

Inflation is at a four-year low. Wage growth is strong, with more than 620,000 new jobs added since January. Business investment is accelerating and optimism is returning. Underpinning that momentum is PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s pro-growth policies \u2013 and the small businesses his agenda is built to strengthen.\nWith the\"One Big, Beautiful Bill Act of 2025,\"Republicans are working to solidify Trump\u2019s agenda with the most sweeping tax and entitlement overhaul ever \u2013 to ensure the Main Street comeback isn\u2019t temporary, but lasting.\nSince February, I\u2019ve traveled across the country meeting with small business owners in nearly every sector \u2013 from family farms and factory floors to the Main Street cornerstones of restaurants and retailers. Their message is clear: they don\u2019t want bailouts, bigger tax bills or bureaucracy. They want a tax code that enables them to plan for the long term, puts more money in their pockets, and rewards \u2013 not punishes \u2013 work, entrepreneurship and growth. This bill delivers on all three.\nTHE \u2018ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL\u2019 URGENTLY NEEDS A MAKEOVER TO USHER IN TRUMP\u2019S GOLDEN AGE\nThanks toTrump\u2019s commitment to ending wasteful spending,data shows that inflation is no longer the top concern for small businesses. Today, the threat of rising taxes has taken the top spot. Unless Congress acts soon, the 2017 Trumptax cutswill expire, raising the top tax rate on small business pass-through income to 43.4%. That would hit more than two-thirds of small business owners, most of whom file taxes as individuals.\nTrump's tax relief should help businesses on Main Street, USA.

This provision alone is projected to create 1 million new jobs on Main Street and generate $750 billion in economic activity over the next decade.\nThe bill also keeps cash in the wallets of blue-collar Americans. With no taxes on tips or overtime, it raises take-home pay for our workers without increasing costs for their employers. It repeals the IRS\u2019s $600 reporting rule, which created compliance headaches for millions of gig economy workers and small sellers. It increases the Child Tax Credit and standard deduction for working families. And it protects family farms from the death tax \u2013 preserving generational assets rather than taxing them twice.\nTRUMP PUSHES 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS SOLUTION TO FOUR YEARS OF BIDEN FAILURES: 'LARGEST TAX CUT, EVER'\nTo address the post-pandemic labor shortage, the bill incentivizes work, with work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents receivingMedicaid benefits,bringing nearly 4.8 million Americans back into the workforce and removing 1.4 million illegal aliens who do not qualify for Medicaid. At a time when small businesses are still struggling to hire, this is a necessary step to align government incentives with opportunity to pursue the American Dream.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe legislation also reinforces a key goal of Trump\u2019s economic vision:Made in America.Companies that manufacture here will benefit from targeted tax incentives, including interest deduction for American-made vehicles. They can take advantage of full expensing for investments in capital and equipment, R&D and factory construction. These provisions don\u2019t just encourage domestic production \u2013 they renew our industrial base and create good-paying jobs for American workers.\nFinally, the bill tackles one of the most overlooked obstacles to small business success:regulatory overreachand costs. Under the Biden administration, Washington added an estimated $5.8 trillion in new regulations. The \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" reins in those costs, clears out bureaucratic red tape, and restores a business climate where job creators can focus on growing \u2013 not just staying afloat.\nIT'S TIME FOR CONGRESS TO DELIVER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' TO HIS DESK\nSupport for the bill spans party lines \u2013 just not in Washington. A majority ofsmall business owners,including many left-leaning entrepreneurs, back the legislation\u2019s core provisions. That\u2019s because these ideas aren\u2019t ideological \u2013 they\u2019re practical.

During the previous four years, that number was higher than the current rating only once, when it hit 32% in June 2024. For reference, at the end of the first Trump administration, 33% gave economic conditions positive marks (December 2020), but that had been as high as 55% in January 2020 (just before the pandemic).\nCurrently, 62% say their family is getting ahead (14%) or holding steady financially (48%), up 5 points since January. The 36% who say they are falling behind is the lowest in four years.\nFOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM\nStill,economicsentiment is mostly gloomy: 84% are extremely or very concerned about inflation, 68% score conditions as only fair or poor, and 55% feel pessimistic about the economy.\nDemocrats, Independents, women, and voters without a college degree are among those most likely to say the economy is in bad shape, while Republicans, men, and college graduates are among those most likely to rate it better.\nFOX NEWS POLL: DEMOCRATS' FAVORABILITY HITS NEW LOW, STILL FAVORED OVER GOP IN 2026 MIDTERMS\n\"During theBidenyears, Republicans and independents were overwhelmingly negative about the economy, while Democrats were slightly less so,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps run the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"Now with Trump as president, Democrats think the sky is falling, while Republicans see rays of sunlight.\"\nBy a 21-point margin, voters oppose the federal budget legislation passed by the House of Representatives that the president calls the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" (38% favor vs. 59% oppose). About half think the bill would hurt their family (49%), while one quarter think it would help (23%), and another quarter don\u2019t think it would make a difference (26%).\nSixty percent feel they have a good understanding of what is in the OBBB, and while those voters are more likely to favor the legislation than those who are unfamiliar with it, more still think it will hurt rather than help their family (45% vs. 34%).\nViews of the legislation are highly partisan, withRepublicansfavoring it (73%), and Democrats (89%) and Independents (73%) opposed. Fewer than half of Republicans think it will help their family (46%).\nOverall, 57% think tariffs hurt the economy, the highest ever recorded in Fox News surveys -- and double the number who think tariffs help.\nWhile a majority (53%) approve of Trump\u2019s handling of border security (46% disapprove), the president otherwise receives negative marks on the issues: immigration (46% approve, 53% disapprove), and foreign policy (42-57%). His worst ratings are on the economy (40-58%) and inflation (34-64%), where he\u2019s underwater by a whopping 30 points.\nThe president\u2019s overall job approval stands at 46%, while 54% disapprove. That\u2019s up a couple ticks from 44-55% in April. His highest approval, 49%, came in March 2025 and April 2020. Men under age 45 (55% approve) and White men without a college degree (54% approve) are among those giving the president his best marks. Seven in 10 Republicans consider themselves part of the MAGA movement, and fully 98% of them approve.\nAbout 90% ofDemocratsdisapprove of the job Trump is doing generally and on specific issues, with the exception of border security, where fewer disapprove (80%). Most Republicans are with Trump, but approval drops to 68% on inflation and 75% on the economy, generally. Disapproval among Independents ranges from roughly half on border security to three-quarters on inflation.\nWhen voters are asked how they feel about Trump as a person, his ratings are underwater by 10 points: 45% have a favorable opinion and 55% an unfavorable view. For comparison, that\u2019s about on par with JD Vance (44- 53%), Joe Biden (43-56%), and Marco Rubio (42-46%), and ahead of Elon Musk (41-58%), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (40-45%), Gavin Newsom (39-45%), and Pete Hegseth (32-45%), while his ratings trail those of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (48-50%) and Kamala Harris (49-51%). Harris\u2019s higher favorability comes from more Democrats (87%) and Independents (38%) viewing her positively compared to favorable views of Trump among Republicans (85%) and Independents (34%).\nNone of those tested \u2013 not the president, not the vice president and not the former president nor the former vice president -- garnered positive marks from at least 50% of voters, although Harris comes closest.\nAs mentioned above, most are concerned about inflation (84%), including 78% of Republicans.\nBy a single point, the future of the U.S. narrowly tops inflation as voters\u2019 top concern, with 85% saying they\u2019re worried about the direction of the country. That includes 8 in 10 Republicans, and 9 in 10 Democrats and Independents.\nEight in 10 voters are concerned about government spending and Iran getting a nuclear weapon, while around 7 in 10 are worried about antisemitism, illegal immigration, and the use of the U.S. military domestically, and roughly 6 in 10 about protests in U.S. cities.\nMore Democrats (87%) and Independents (71%) express concern about the deployment of federal troops in cities in response to anti-ICE protests than Republicans (42%). On the other hand, more Republicans (84%) are worried about illegal immigration than Independents (68%) and Democrats (49%).\nThere are zero issues that all three groups, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, agree on as priorities. The top three concerns for Democrats are the future of the U.S., inflation, and U.S. troops being deployed, while for Republicans, it\u2019s illegal immigration, Iran getting nukes, and government spending.\u00a0 Among Independents, it\u2019s the future of the country, inflation, and government spending.\nCLICK HERE FORCROSSTABSANDTOPLINE\nConducted June 13-16, 2025, under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,003 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file.

Flake graphite, a major component in lithium-ion battery anodes, is currently 100% imported, but Alaska could provide domestic supply.\nThe state is also an oil and gas titan, yet most of the natural gas produced is not brought to market because of lack of pipeline infrastructure.\nDuring President Trump\u2019s first term, the oil and gas industry in Alaska supported47,300 total jobs, provided $4.6 billion in labor income to Alaska and contributed $19.4 billion to Alaska\u2019s total gross domestic product, which was more than 35% of the state\u2019s total GDP.\nBy contrast, the previous administration all but ended oil and gas drilling on the North Slope and canceled the seven remaining leases for drilling on the coastal plains, sacrificing economic growth, energy security, affordable reliable power generation and prosperity for all Alaskans.\nAMERICA'S ENERGY CRISIS IS HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT AND IT'S WORSE THAN YOU KNOW\nPresident Trump\u2019s vision for us to unleash oil, gas, coal and even critical minerals in Alaska could generate billions of dollars in revenue and thousands of high-paying jobs.\nProducing this bounty would set us on a path to fulfill President Trump\u2019s vision forU.S. energy dominance.\nWe can\u2019t afford not to produce Alaskan energy.\nI was fortunate to visit with the Chenega Regional Development Group, LLC and native Alaskans of the Chenega tribe on this trip.

It also risks undermining the constitutional role of state legislatures to protect the interests and rights of American children and working families amid AI\u2019s far-reaching social and economic disruptions.\nIn the absence of Congressional action, states have been the first line of defense againstBig Tech.\u00a0Texas,\u00a0Florida,\u00a0Utah, and other states have led the way to protect children online, safeguard data privacy, and rein in platform censorship.\nSection 43201 puts many of those laws\u2014even those not directly related to AI\u2014at risk.\nThe provision defines \"automated decision systems\" broadly, potentially capturing\u00a0core functions\u00a0of social media platforms, such as TikTok\u2019s For You feed or Instagram\u2019s recommendation engine.\nAt least\u00a012 states\u00a0have enacted laws\u00a0requiring parental consent or age verification\u00a0for minors accessing these platforms. However, because these laws specifically apply to social media platforms, they could easily be construed as regulating \"automated decision systems\"\u2014 and thus be swept up in the moratorium.\nFurther, Section 43201 might also block provisions of\u00a0existing\u00a0state\u00a0privacy\u00a0laws that restrict the use of algorithms\u2014including AI\u2014to predict consumer behavior, preferences, or characteristics.\nEven setting aside concerns with the moratorium\u2019s expansive scope, it suffers from a more fundamental flaw.\nThe moratorium threatens to short-circuit American federalism by undermining state laws that ensure AI lives up to the promise\u00a0outlined\u00a0by Vice PresidentJ.D. Vance.\nSpeaking at the Paris AI Summit, he warned against viewing \"AI as a purely disruptive technology that will inevitably automate away our labor force.\"\nInstead,Vance called for\"policies that ensure that AI\u2026 make[s] our workers more productive\" and rewards them with \"higher wages, better benefits, and safer and more prosperous communities.\"\nThat vision is nearly impossible without state-level action. Legislators, governors, and attorneys general from Nashville to Salt Lake City are already advancing creative, democratically accountable solutions.\nTennessee\u2019s novel\u00a0ELVIS Act\u00a0protects music artists from nonconsensual AI-generated voice and likeness cloning. Utah\u2019s\u00a0AI consumer protection law\u00a0requires that generative AI model deployers notify consumers when they are interacting with an AI.\nOther\u00a0states, including\u00a0Arkansas\u00a0and\u00a0Montana, are building legal frameworks for digital property rights with respect to AI models, algorithms, data, and model outputs.\nAll of this is now at risk.\nAs laboratories of democracy, states are essential to navigating the inevitable and innumerable trade-offs entailed by the diffusion ofemerging technologies. Federalism enables continuous experimentation and competition between states\u2014exposing the best and worst approaches to regulation in highly dynamic environments.\nThat\u2019s critical when confronting AI\u2019s vast and constantly evolving sphere of impact on children and employment\u2014to say nothing of the technology\u2019s wider socio-economic effects.\nSixty leading advocacy and research organizations have\u00a0warned\u00a0thatAI chatbotspose a significant threat to kids.

And I\u2019ve seen how learning construction technology can do more than build a career, it can restore confidence, dignity and purpose.\nThis is personal for me. I lead a university, yes, but I also lead with the conviction that education should serve the whole person: spiritually, practically and vocationally. That\u2019s why I believe the future of higher ed must includethe trades, not as a fallback, but as a foundation.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nChristian tradition understands this well. Jesus worked with wood and nails before preaching in synagogues. Paul made tents to support his ministry. Scripture doesn\u2019t draw a line between spiritual work and skilled labor.

One that stops looking down on trades and starts investing in them, not just with funding, but with respect. That means parents affirming their child\u2019s calling, even if it leads to a job site instead of a boardroom. It means pastors reminding their congregations that all honest work is sacred. And it means more universities embracing flexible, high-quality training that equips students for lives of both character and competence.\nThe goal isn\u2019t to pit trade schools againsttraditional universities.

I paid a premium for those tickets \u2013 and I\u2019m OK with that. It was my choice \u2013 not something I can deduct from my taxes or expect to be federally subsidized.\nThat\u2019s the way it should be.\nThe same goes for my guilty pleasure: \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\" I don\u2019t mind watching the antics of one of America\u2019s most famous (and wealthiest) families, but I\u2019d never ask taxpayers to help fund their children\u2019sprivate school tuition.\nInstead of helping students in underfunded schools, measures like the ECCA divert public dollars to families who already have access to private education.(iStock)\nAnd yet, some in Congress think that\u2019s precisely what we should do.\nTRUMP'S DECISION TO GUT THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT IS NOT ONLY ILLEGAL, IT'S WRONG\nA proposal quietly tucked into the House GOP\u2019s reconciliation package, part of what\u2019s being marketed as PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s \"Big, Beautiful Bill,\" would give wealthy individuals and corporations a 100% federal tax credit for donations to private school scholarship funds.\nThis proposal \u2013 the Educational Choice for Children Act (ECCA) \u2013 effectively allows wealthy donors to turn tuition into a tax write-off.\nThat\u2019s right. This plan, currently before the U.S. Senate, would allow billionaires to \"donate\" to their kids\u2019 private schools \u2013 and then receive every cent back in tax relief, at the expense of American taxpayers.\nThis is not a small-dollar program. The measure could siphon more than $10 billion away from federal revenues, funds that could otherwise strengthen our nation\u2019s public schools.\nNow, I don\u2019t think Blue Ivy Carter or North West needs our help getting into elite institutions. However, the backers of this bill, such as House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, have argued that it\u2019s primarily about helping working-class students escape \"low-performing\" schools.\nA FAILING NATION'S REPORT CARD PROVES NEED FOR SWEEPING CHANGE\n\"It will encourage more individuals and businesses to invest in our children\u2019s futures,\" Stefanik said, \"by establishing a 75%federal tax creditfor qualified charitable contributions made to nonprofit schools with proven success.\"\nThat sounds good \u2013 until you look at the evidence.\nIn practice, measures like ECCA have the opposite effect. Instead of helping students in underfunded schools, they divert public dollars to families who already have access to private education.\nWe\u2019ve seen it happen in more than 20 states, where private schools receive more than $1 billion each year through similar tax credits, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. A 2023 report in St. Louis Today revealed that most students receiving vouchers in Missouri were already attending private schools, while only 35% came from public schools.\nIn other words, this isn\u2019t about opportunity. It\u2019s about entitlement.\nWHY I DEDICATED MY BOOK ON SCHOOL CHOICE TO RANDI WEINGARTEN\nEvery year, public schools educate nearly 50 million students \u2013 more than 90% of the nation\u2019s children. These taxpayer-funded institutions have produced extraordinary alumni, including the CEOs of Apple, Walmart and the majority of Fortune 500 companies.\nPublic schools are where kids learn how to live and work in a diverse democracy. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are essential.\nEducators know thisbetter than anyone. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey of more than 2,300 public school teachers found that most feel underpaid, under-supported and under-resourced.\nRespondents also reported a deep commitment to their students and their profession. More than half of these educators said they wished the public understood the difficulty of their job. Teachers across the U.S. are clear: students don\u2019t need more \"choice\" \u2013 they need more investment.\nAs one Kentucky educator told the Louisville Courier Journal earlier this year, \"If lawmakers actually stepped into our classrooms, they\u2019d see what we\u2019re doing with so little. Give us more counselors, working air conditioning, and reading specialists \u2013 don\u2019t hand tax breaks to people who already have advantages.\"\nMY VISION FOR ELIMINATING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nThese educators are on the front lines. They\u2019re not asking for handouts. They\u2019re asking for fairness \u2013 and for policies that reflect the real needs of public school communities.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the original pitch behindvoucher programs\u2013 dating back to the early 2000s \u2013 was to help low-income families in struggling urban districts. But decades of research have shown that voucher students don\u2019t perform significantly better in reading or math than their public school peers.\nMeanwhile, the programs have drained resources from the very schools most in need of help. That\u2019s not reform. That\u2019s abandonment.\nThe concept of \"school choice\" has become a catch-all for undermining public education without explicitly stating so. But make no mistake: this is a wealth transfer in disguise, and ECCA is its latest vehicle.\nAs a son of immigrants and a proud product of public schools, I know firsthand what public education can offer. I\u2019ve seen how classrooms can unlock potential and teachers can change lives.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nI\u2019ve also seen what happens when we neglect those systems and call it innovation. This isn\u2019t just bad policy. It\u2019s a betrayal of the American promise.\nLet\u2019s be clear: families have every right to choose private or religious schools for their children. But they shouldn\u2019t expect the rest of us to foot the bill.Tax dollarsshould be allocated where the need is greatest \u2013 schools that serve all students, regardless of their ZIP code, income or background.\nAt a time when the country feels increasingly divided, our public schools are one of the few places where kids from every walk of life still come together. That\u2019s something worth protecting, not defunding.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOr, to borrow a phrase from Queen Bey herself, what\u2019s happening with this bill is more than just a bad idea.

But he needs Congress to do its part by ensuring that the\"One Big, Beautiful Bill\"isn\u2019t neutered by shortsighted compromise.\nRecently, Trump gave Senate Republicans the green light to make changes to the House version of his signature legislative initiative, openly acknowledging that there is room to significantly improve on its current form.\nI\u2019ve been working publicly and privately to advocate for this bill since before Trump\u2019s reelection, collaborating with some of the greatest business leaders and economists in the country to ensure that we make the absolute most of this rare opportunity to set this country up for long-term economic prosperity.\nTRUMP PUSHES 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS SOLUTION TO FOUR YEARS OF BIDEN FAILURES: 'LARGEST TAX CUT, EVER'\nWe\u2019ve identified several provisions that add significantly to the bill\u2019s \"score\" from the Congressional Budget Office (a measure of how much the legislation is projected to affect the federal budget) without offering commensurate economic benefits. Addressing these provisions would free up space to expand the bill\u2019s most impactful pro-growth elements \u2014 most significantly by creating the budget room to make theTrump tax cutspermanent.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans celebrated passing Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(Getty Images)\nOne element of theHouse billthat needs to be eliminated is a provision offering full expensing for new structures. While it might sound like a good, pro-growth idea to allow companies to deduct the entire cost of a new building the year it\u2019s placed into service, in practice no public company would ever take advantage of it \u2014 because taking the deduction would slash their reported earnings, harming their stock value and investor confidence.\nEven private businesses face structural hurdles, including the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT), income mismatches and the reality that bonus depreciation already provides ample incentive. Buildings are long-term investments. A one-year tax write-off simply isn\u2019t the deciding factor.\nGOP SENATORS EXPRESS 'CONCERNS,' 'SKEPTICISM' OVER TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL AFTER MUSK RANT\nAccording to the CBO, however, this provision alone adds $148 billion to the projected cost of the \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\" That\u2019s a huge chunk of change that crowds out other worthwhile provisions that companies would actually use to increase productivity and output.\nBlue state Republicans successfully fought for the inclusion of a much more generous cap onstate and local tax (SALT) deductions,which the House bill raises from $10,000 to $40,000. The increased cap means that about 90% of filers will be able to deduct the full value of their state and local taxes from their federal income tax, adding an estimated $320 billion to the cost of the legislation.\nOnce again, however, the projections fail to account for the actual, real-world implications of the provision. Because of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), very few filers would even be able to claim the full deduction at the $40,000 cap used in the House bill. In other words, blue state Republicans are sabotaging this legislation for the sake of political theater \u2014 they don\u2019t expect voters to understand the nuances of tax law, and when they run for re-election next year, they want to be able to tell their constituents that they went to bat for them.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nIn fact, raising the SALT cap could ultimately hurt many blue state taxpayers, because Democrat elected officials in those states would use the increased cap to justify raising taxes even higher while telling voters that Uncle Sam will be offsetting a significant portion of the cost.\nTRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' FACES RESISTANCE FROM REPUBLICAN SENATORS OVER DEBT FEARS\nWe\u2019re fortunate that theTrump tax cutsare coming up for renewal at a time when Republicans control the White House and both Houses of Congress. But who will be in charge the next time the tax cuts are due to expire? We should not be forcing American families to live with the anxiety of wondering whether their taxes will automatically shoot up if the political winds aren\u2019t blowing the right way in the future. Likewise, we can\u2019t expect businesses to make the long-term investments oureconomyneeds if they can\u2019t reliably project tax rates even just a few years into the future.\nCertainty and stability are essential to sound economic policy. With the savings from eliminating full and immediate expensing of structures and lowering the SALT cap back to $10,000,Congressshould be able to make the individual and corporate tax reductions permanent, creating the conditions for long-term growth.\nThe White House launched a new website tabulating how much the big beautiful bill is anticipated to save Americans.(White House\u00a0)\nThe fixes outlined above could also create room in the budget forfull and immediate expensing of R&Dinvestments. Unlike expensing of new structures, companies would eagerly take advantage of tax write-offs on their research and development costs. This was included in the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, but is currently in the process of being automatically phased out.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCompetitors such as Great Britain and China are already offering permanent, full and immediate expensing of domestic R&D investments. If America intends to keep up in the race to develop and perfect world-changing new technology like artificial intelligence, we can\u2019t afford to be out-competed by the incentives offered by other countries.\nThanks to President Trump\u2019s visionary leadership, America is on the precipice of a new Golden Age \u2014 if only Congress can get tax policy right.

{"title": "Invisible tax: Government debt is crushing your finances", "date": "2025-05-30", "body": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on senators pushing for changes to the House-passed spending bill as it moves to the Senate for debate.\nMortgage rates\u00a0rose again this week, with the average 30-year fixed rate climbing past 6.8%. That\u2019s not just a post-pandemic hangover; it\u2019s a warning sign. Behind the scenes,rising government debtis putting steady upward pressure on borrowing costs.\nIf your mortgage, car loan, or credit card payments are more expensive than they were a few years ago, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 and despite what you may have heard, it\u2019s not just because of inflation or Federal Reserve policy. The surge in federal borrowing is helping inflate interest rates across the board.\nIfgovernment debthad stayed at 2015 levels, the typical family could be paying $222 less per month on their mortgage. Go back to 2005 debt levels and the number jumps to $536. That\u2019s real money disappearing from household budgets not because of the jump in home prices, but because Washington can\u2019t stop borrowing.\nDAVID MARCUS: WHY NOBODY WANTS TO CUT THE NATIONAL DEBT DESPITE EVERYONE SAYING THEY SHOULD\nFor years, economists puzzled over why interest rates kept falling. Aging populations, slower productivity, and foreign demand for American debt were all cited as reasons. One result was that Uncle Sam took advantage and racked uplarger deficits and debt. After all, refinancing was affordable at low rates. Another was that Americans got used to lower monthly mortgage payments, auto loans, and other interest rate-related expenses.\nNow, we\u2019re grappling with interest rates that have surged and stayed stubbornly high. The change followed a torrent ofunfunded federal spendingin 2020 and especially 2021 which exploded the deficit, shook investor confidence in America\u2019s long-term fiscal stability, and caused bond markets to react to policymakers\u2019 fiscal bravado.\nMy\u00a0new research\u00a0for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, along with a growing body of economic literature, shows the debt itself is pushing up long-term interest rates \u2014 and by more than some experts are willing to admit. While broader economic changes and policy decisions also play roles, this particular problem is too big to ignore.\nOver time, as trillions of dollars in debt compound, the Treasury shells out hundreds of billions more in interest payments. It\u2019s not just a problem for Washington\u2019s balance sheet. It\u2019s a problem for yours.\nEconomists have a term for what\u2019s happening: \"crowding out.\" When the government borrows more, it competes with private borrowers for capital. And when two consumers want the same thing, the price usually goes up \u2014 in this case, the price of borrowing (interest rates).\nAll kinds of important things become more expensive: mortgage payments, car loans, student loans, credit card debt. These are not abstract concerns. They determine whether plenty of families can afford to buy a home, send someone to college or buy a new car or truck. They determine whether someone can start or expand a business and provide more people with jobs.\nTake housing. Mortgage rates are now hovering near their highest levels in over 20 years. That\u2019s not because lumber or labor costs spiked, but because of the effects of\u00a0federal borrowing.\nStudent loan interest rates are tied to Treasury yields, which means college graduates are now repaying debt at the highest rates in almost two decades. Auto loan rates are rising too, pricing out lower-income consumers.\nFor Americans with credit card debt (almost half of U.S. households carry a balance) the average interest rate is now around 20%, driven in part by the same upward pressure caused by growing federal debt.\nThesedebt-driven rate increasesare an invisible tax on all of us. Families feel the squeeze every month. Businesses delay investments. Budding entrepreneurs face higher hurdles.\nWhy aren\u2019t more economists talking about the problem? It\u2019s complicated.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO), for example, significantly underestimates the effect. Its\u00a0latest projections\u00a0assume long-term interest rates will stabilize at lower levels even as government debt as a share of the economy grows. But if debt pushes rates up more than the CBO predicts \u2014 as most empirical studies now show \u2014 then its rosy forecasts won\u2019t reflect how much the federal government will pay just in interest.\nBeyond our own households, there are consequences for the whole economy and government. Higher interest costs mean less money for education, infrastructure, or tax relief. They increase the risk of a debt spiral in which interest payments themselves become the fastest-growing part of the budget.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMost people understand that the federal government\u2019s borrowing binge can\u2019t go on forever, and that it will burden future generations of taxpayers. But if you\u2019re between the ages of 19 and 99, the tax is probably already hitting you in some way each and every month.

{"title": "MORNING GLORY: Trump emerges as 'closer-in-chief' to push 'one big, beautiful' tax bill through Congress", "date": "2025-05-29", "body": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on U.S. Senate efforts to pass President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' on 'Special Report.'\nWhen then-President-electDonald Trumpdeclared to me on January 5 of this year that \"My preference is one big, as I say,one big, beautiful bill,\"he started a snowball rolling down Congressional Hill that has gathered momentum and should be on his desk, perhaps by July 4, and certainly not later than Labor Day weekend. Trump willed H.R. 1 into being the way he willed his return to the Oval Office: By speaking clearly and repeatedly about what had to be done. Turns out the commander-in-chief is also the \"closer-in-chief.\"\nOf course, the House and Senate GOP knew they could not have allowed Trump\u2019s 2017 triumph of his first tax bill to expire at the end of this year and thus shatter an economy recovering its bearings and its potential for great growth after the disastrous years of inflation unleashed by former President Joe Biden\u2019s reckless looting of the federal treasury.\nBut neither did it seem likely they could make the Trump tax code permanent as well as add more cuts to taxable income for folks who depend on tips, for seniors and for homeowners in states with burdensome tax rates.\nSCOOP: HOUSE GOP MEMO HIGHLIGHTS REPUBLICAN WINS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'\nBut the president worked so closely with House SpeakerMike Johnson,Majority Leader\u00a0Steve Scalise\u00a0and Majority Whip Tom Emmer that he not only got the \"one, big, beautiful bill\" through the House, he got what he promised on the campaign trail last year. Now he seems likely to help Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thuneand Senate GOP Whip John Barrasso and Conference Chair Senator Tom Cotton pilot H.R. 1 through the narrows of that body.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans celebrated passing Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(Getty Images)\nBut the challenge will come when the Senate \"leaves its fingerprints\" on the bill, as West Virginia Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito put it to\"the fellas\"on the \"Ruthless\" podcast this week. Senators have ideas too. They are equal participants with the House members and the Senate GOP can also only lose three of their 53 votes and still carry the \"one, big, beautiful bill\" forward.\nThere are two things which can be done to make the bill better and also create some space for money for rural hospitals which, as Capito stressed, is of great concern to many in the GOP conference.\nMIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET \u2018BIG, 'BEAUTIFUL\u2019 WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE\nThe first big change is to add a process by which entitlement reform could commence, and the second is an\"IRA/401k conversion window\"where a flat tax would be applied to seniors who wish to convert their IRA/401k assets into Roth IRAs, a window which if opened for this tax year, would yield trillions in revenue next year and thus prevent the \"one, big beautiful bill\" from increasing the debt, while also being wildly popular with the demographic most likely to vote in the 2026 mid-terms.\nFirst, fiscal hawks worried about the rising debt could be lured into supporting the final version of the bill by the promise of a shot at entitlement reform \u2014 not cuts \u2014 in this Congress. To accomplish this requires the senators remember both the \"Greenspan Commission\" and the \"BRACs.\"\nThe Greenspan Commission, officially the National Commission on Social Security Reform, was a bipartisan commission appointed by President Ronald Reagan and the leaders of the two houses in 1981 to address a short-term financing crisis facing Social Security.\nLed by Alan Greenspan, its report produced the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which included both benefit-reduction and revenue-raising measures to address the projected funding shortfall. Social Security was in much worse shape then than now. Now, Social Security, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, need reforms, not benefit cuts.\nINSIDE TRUMP'S URGENT MEETING WITH HOUSE GOP TO PASS THE 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'\nThe \"BRAC\" was the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, established by law, which proposed closures or realignments of military facilities across the U.S and the world to improve efficiency and reduce costs. A BRAC Commission has been used five times \u2014 with rounds initiated in 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995 and 2005 \u2013 and each produced lists of military bases and facilities to be combined or closed.\nIts members compiled the lists and the result was presented to Congress with the choice: do nothing and the BRAC recommendations became law or pass a resolution rejecting them all. It was and remains a brilliant idea that can be applied to entitlement reforms produced by a new Greenspan Commission.\nIdaho Sen. Mike Crapo told Hugh Hewitt that a flat tax on IRA/401(k) conversions could raise at least $1 trillion.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe new commission, like the original, would be made up of presidential and congressional appointees. It would be tasked with proposing entitlement reforms that would \u2014 very gradually\u2014 make entitlements fiscally stable. (An example: Raise the retirement age a month every year for the next 40 years, which would raise the retirement age to 69 by 2065. That is a \"reform\" not a cut, one so gradual as to be unnoticed by Social Security recipients who are already working longer without a prompt from the federal government. Similar reforms for Medicare and Medicaid can be put into place that allow for gentle transitions of the sort that responsible reforms embrace.)\nTRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' PASSES KEY HOUSE HURDLE AFTER GOP REBEL MUTINY\nI\u2019ve written about the second big add-onbefore: the flat tax on IRA/401(k) conversions.\nIdaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told me last month this reform is very much on the table. It would raise at least a trillion dollars in one-time revenue and perhaps twice that amount or more. There is opposition from the retirement planning community that operates IRAs and other retirement vehicles, but those offered a 10% or 15% or even a 20% tax on conversion from standard retirement accounts to Roth accounts would applaud long and hard and remember this change come November 2026.\nLed by Alan Greenspan, its report produced the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which included both benefit-reduction and revenue-raising measures to address the projected funding shortfall.\nThe impact of the amendment to the tax code would fly through theSenateparliamentarian\u2019s review under the \"Byrd rule\" and more than balance out the fiscal impact of increasing the SALT deduction. Here\u2019s to sanity among the bill\u2019s drafters in the Senate: Sometimes the obvious thing to do is also the right thing to do.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWith just these two additions to the bill, both fiscal hawks and the politically minded would find the \"one, big, beautiful bill\" a magnet that could not be resisted.\nAll the Senate has to do is polish up H.R. 1 and the Congress can go home for a well-earned summer vacation.\nHugh Hewitt is a Fox News contributor, and host of \"The Hugh Hewitt Show\" heard weekday afternoons 3 PM to 6 PM ET on the Salem Radio Network, and simulcast on Salem News Channel.

Now even more tariffs threaten an economy already staggering from the uncertainty set off by Trump\u2019s erratic policies, attacks on the rule of law, and threatening statements.\nAdding more injury to injury, Trump and his MAGA allies just forced the \"Big Beautiful Bill Act\" through the House of Representatives -- by one vote. Their divisive, financially unhealthy approach boils down to trillions in tax cuts for the ultra-rich, devastating cuts in basic health care and food services, and crippling new debt for us, our kids, and grandkids. Worse yet, right after the bill passed, Trump proudly announced more job-killing, cost-raising tariffs on allies and iPhones.\nWhen he ran for president in 2024, Trump promised us inflation would end \"immediately\" and that we\u2019d feel prices falling on \"Day One.\" To millions of 2024 swing voters -- a decisive voting bloc in the election -- that was the whole point of choosing him. But now prices are higher, economic growth is declining and life is harder than it was when Trump took the oath of office in January.\nELON MUSK 'DISAPPOINTED' BY TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL, SAYS IT UNDERMINES WHAT DOGE IS DOING\nSince Inauguration Day, consumer sentiment has plunged to historic lows. Moody\u2019s downgraded America\u2019s credit rating for the first time in over 100 years.\u00a0 Ford and Walmart are raising prices because of the tariffs.\nNow, instead of making our economy take off like a \"rocket ship,\" as he also promised, Trump is killing it with a sweetheart tax deal for his Mar-A-Lago friends. A president who promised to stand up to the establishment is effectively laundering taxpayers\u2019 money to line the silk pockets of his own preferred elites -- to the detriment of middle-class families and American business.\nNow, the American economy, which was unequivocally outperforming every other country on earth when Donald Trump tookover, is falling behind in ways it hasn\u2019t in decades.\nNO MILLIONAIRE TAX HIKE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'\nSpecial tax giveaways, like a write-off for buying private jets, are paid for with the biggest Medicaid cuts in history, higher health insurance premiums, and gutting food programs for distressed working families. They\u2019re putting the rest of the price tag on the nation\u2019s credit card, adding trillions to the debt and raising the cost of a house, car, or student loan.\nIn communities all over the country, the tariff taxes are crushing supply chains and freezing hiring decisions. Port traffic is sporadic, and retailers warn of empty shelves in the stores.\nInNorth Carolina, Trump\u2019s tariffs arepenalizingthe manufacturers he claims to be supporting, killing jobs and reducing U.S. exports.\u00a0 Just when a Greenville-based manufacturer was on the verge of plant renovations that would add 25 new jobs, the equipment they needed to expand was hit with a new tariff.

SNAP, the nation\u2019s food relief program, would be starved.

The reduction in American tariffs allows China to resume sales to the U.S.\u2014America accounts for more than a third of global consumer spending\u2014but the reduction in Chinese tariffs does little to permit American goods to enter China. The main obstacles to American exports to China are China\u2019s non-tariff barriers, and the announced pause does nothing to end non-tariff barriers put in place before April 2, \"Liberation Day,\" as Trump called it.\nBILLIONAIRE RAY DALIO RAISES ALARM OVER CHINA, SAYS TRUMP RENEGOTIATING TRADE DEALS 'HAS TO HAPPEN'\nMoreover, the reduction inU.S. tariffsis akin to unilateral disarmament. U.S. tariffs are generally remedies for China\u2019s theft of U.S. intellectual property and its increasingly predatory trade practices. During the pause, China is continuing these unacceptable practices without facing the penalty of America\u2019s elevated tariffs.\n\"China came out on top,\" Alan Tonelson, an American trade expert who blogs at RealityChek told me. \"No question, we got the short end of the stick.\"\nTrump\u2019s \"tariff war,\" as the Chinese regime calls it, could not have come at a worse time for the Communist Party.\nThe country\u2019s economy was already in distress.

The Communist Party, almost everyone then assumed, would see it in its interest in maintaining an international system that was responsible for China\u2019s rise.\n\"By now, it\u2019s clear that our hopeful assumptions about China\u2019s trajectory were fundamentally wrong,\" Charles Burton of the Sinopsis think tank told me this week. \"As China grew stronger, the Communist Party became even more hostile, belligerent, and dangerous.\"\nThis month,Xi Jinpingdemonstrated that cooperation with his hostile, belligerent, and dangerous regime is not possible.

And what we have seen thus far is still too big and doesn\u2019t address the critical issues at hand. Frankly, the new bill needs a \"fat shot\" (the humorous moniker President Donald Trump used for weight-loss drugs like Ozempic). And without it, we are just going to push our country nearer to a fiscal cliff.\nAmerica is facing a looming debt crisis. Will Congress have the will to fix it?\nThe problem with our finances is not one of tax collection, it is a spending problem.

Still, that is not enough for the government, which then spends that $5 trillionplusanother $2 trillion \u2013 around 6-7% of GDP \u2013 which then needs to be financed.\nAfter decades of being irresponsible, we are dangerously close to thatfiscal cliff.I worry about the prospects of a debt spiral. That is where the interest on our debt drives up the deficit (as it has). As the government needs to finance that deficit, the supply of Treasury debt increases. That then drives up Treasury yields, which increases our interest costs. That increases the deficits, which again have the same impact and that vicious cycle continues.\nSEAN HANNITY: THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION IS A 'TOTAL, UNMITIGATED DISASTER'\nAnd that\u2019s with debt servicing costs, running at $1.2 trillion at the end of 2024, plus entitlements already exceeding the tax revenue collected, before considering any other spending.\nYet, while everyone knows our debt position is a problem, there doesn\u2019t seem to be the political will to fix it.\nIn a recent X post, Stephen Moore, who has advised Trump on economic issues,posted, \"You\u2019ll need a microscope to see the GOP\u2019s spending cuts! The CBO projects a staggering $89.3 trillion in federal spending over the next decade. The House plan proposes a mere $1.2 trillion reduction, leading to a total of $88.1 trillion\u2014a tiny 1.5% cut! Meanwhile, the Senate suggests an almost laughable $4 billion reduction against $521 billion in increases.

But overdoing the treatment can kill the patient instead, without removing the carcinogens in the economy. Fortunately, the administration\u2019s negotiators have called a truce, and we can reevaluate the treatment\u2019s effectiveness.\nThe last five weeks have seentremendous market turmoil, and not just domestically. The chaos that ensued after April 2 extended around the globe and has forced many nations to the negotiating table with the US\u2014and that includes countries that engage in unfair trade practices. In that sense, the tariffs have been successful.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s play here is to use tariffs as a tool of statecraft to force other nations into reducing their trade barriers through bilateral negotiations. To that end, the preliminary agreement with the United Kingdom shows some promise.\nAmerica must also seriously evaluate what turned the Industrial Belt into the Rust Belt. This hollowing out of the nation\u2019s industrial base was not caused primarily by international trade. Instead, the primary carcinogens were terrible regulatory and tax policies.\nPresident Trump has also used the threat of tariffs very effectively to help secure America\u2019s southern border and stem the flow of fentanyl, which had become the number-one killer of young people.\nINFLATION TICKED SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN APRIL AS TARIFF IMPACT LOOMS\nButthe drama around tariffshas had side effects, like chemotherapy killing off healthy cells in the body. This collateral damage could be found in survey data from the regional Federal Reserve Banks and purchasing manager indexes, all of which pointed to sharp declines in business optimism and planned capital expenditures.\nIn short, the on-again-off-again nature of these tariffs has made it extraordinarily difficult for businesses and consumers to plan. There has also been substantial turbulence in Treasury markets, gold prices, and equities.\nThat is not a broad condemnation of tariffs, just as the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation are not a denunciation of cancer treatments. But it does illustrate why heavy-duty therapies like radiation must be used in a targeted manner. The inaccurate \"reciprocal\" tariff rates released on April 2 caused significant\u2014and unnecessary\u2014damage domestically.\nDuring the current pause in this tariff fight, theTrump administrationwould do well to reevaluate its tariff strategy, ensuring, for example, that its reciprocal tariff rates are in fact truly reciprocal.\nTRUMP REPEATEDLY WALKED BACK TARIFFS IN FIRST 100 DAYS AS WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES LATEST DUTY TAX RELIEF\nAmerica must also seriously evaluate what turned the Industrial Belt into the Rust Belt.

Likewise, we can\u2019t blame China for our burdensome, overly complicated tax code with high marginal rates. We did that to ourselves.\nThis is perhaps best illustrated by answering a geography question: where is the Rust Belt? It\u2019s inChicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, Youngstown, Pittsburgh, etc. In other words, it\u2019s those areas of the country where liberals have imposed particularly high taxes, overregulation of industry, and forced unionization.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nConversely, where is manufacturing seeing a rebirth in America? It\u2019s coming back in places like Texas, Tennessee, and the Carolinas\u2014states with low (or no) income taxes, less regulation, and right-to-work laws.\nFailed domestic public policy is the primary carcinogen wrecking America\u2019s industrial base, and tariffs can\u2019t fix that. At best, fixing international trade problems will give a temporary boost to domestic manufacturing, but the cancer will keep growing.\nPresident Trump\u2019s tariff diplomacy is working to create a level playing field and open foreign consumer markets to domestic producers, but America needs to look within toreshore manufacturingand rebuild the industrial base.\nJust throwing tariffs at the problem is like undergoing chemotherapy and radiation without any lifestyle changes.

It acts independently, meaning it does not require approval from the president or Congress when enacting policies.\nSt. Onge explained to Fox News Digital that \"debt is a rich man's game\" and that billionaires have benefited financially since the pandemic as the Fed worked to \"manipulate interest rates\" down below market value, which subsidized loans.\n\"During COVID, you could get a mortgage for, you know, three, three and a half percent, when inflation was running higher than that,\" he explained. \"You were literally being paid to borrow money, which is not a free market outcome.\u2026 So it makes loans cheap and the rich overwhelmingly borrow money.\"\nELON MUSK WARNS FEDERAL RESERVE MAY FACE DOGE AUDIT\nThe average debt for the top 5% of Americans sits at about $600,000, he said, while the average debt for the vast majority of Americans is roughly $74,000.\n\"That's about a nine times difference,\" he said of the data. \"So if you make loans too cheap, you are giving nine times more money to rich people.\u2026 If you make loans cheap, you're functionally giving $9 to rich people for every $1 to give everybody else.\"\nAssets are even more skewed, he explained, with the top 5% of Americans holding $7.8 million in assets compared to the average American's $62,000 \u2013 notching 130 times the difference between the two demographics, he said.\n\"The value of a stock or even a house are based on the future stream of income, and those are all discounted by the interest rate,\" he said. \"And so pretty close to mechanically, if you cut interest rates in half \u2013 long-term interest rates \u2013 you are doubling the value of stocks.\"\nThe nation's wealthiest residents saw their billions grow even larger in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic due to policies from the Federal Reserve that have deepened the chasm of income inequality, economic experts report.(Jason Reed/File Photo/Reuters)\nSt. Onge pointed to theAmerican economyin the 1970s and the early 2000s, outlining that growth \"took a big step down\" in the 2000s while asset values, such as housing prices and the stock market, skyrocketed.\n\"The reason is because, since the 1970s, the Fed has very aggressively held rates low, and so this has caused all those assets to go up. So stocks have gone up, housing has gone up. And again, those are rich men's games. Overwhelmingly, people who own stocks are rich. Housing is even more skewed.\"\n\"So if you've got a nine times difference on loans between the bottom 50% and the top 5%, and then you've got 130 times on assets, then the Fed manipulating rates down \u2013 they're not doing it to make rich people rich, hopefully \u2013 but that's sort of the consequence of doing that,\" he said. \"Holding long-term interest rates low is to shower money on rich people and to shower it in proportion to which they're rich, right? So the most extreme version of that is going to be billionaires.\"\nFEDERAL RESERVE HOLDS KEY INTEREST RATE STEADY AMID ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY\nEconomist Steve Hanke discussed how the Federal Reserve has fanned the flame of income inequality through its policies at a conference earlier in 2025 at the Mises Institute, an economics-focused think tank based out of Alabama.\n\"In 2020, billionaires' share of GDP was 14.1%. Now, it's 21.1%. The Fed increased the money supply, asset prices went up, & guess who owns the assets? Billionaires. By ignoring the money supply, the Fed is an ENGINE OF INCOME INEQUALITY,\" he posted to X inApril of his findings.\nThe Federal Reserve acts independently, meaning it does not require approval from President Donald Trump or Congress when enacting policies.(Alex Brandon/The Associated Press)\n\"Take the Federal Reserve\u2019s excessive money printing during the pandemic,\"Hanke said in an interviewpublished by the think tank in April. \"The transmission mechanism of monetary policy roughly dictates that changes in the money supply are followed by changes in asset prices in 1\u20139 months\u2019 time, changes in real economic activity in 6\u201318 months\u2019 time, and finally changes in the price level in 12\u201324 months\u2019 time.\"\n\"Thanks to the Fed\u2019s helicopter money drops beginning with COVID, the annual growth rate of the US broad money supply peaked at 18.1% per year in May 2021,\" he added. \"Lo and behold, the transmission mechanism followed \u2013 the S&P 500 reached a local maximum in December 2021 (6 months later), and inflation peaked at 9.1% per year in July 2022 (14 months later).\"\nUS JOB GROWTH COOLED IN APRIL AMID ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY\n\"During COVID, you could get a mortgage for, you know, three, three and a half percent, when inflation was running higher than that,\" economist Peter St. Onge noted.(Chris Delmas/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe result, he said, was skyrocketing wealth inequality to the tune of billionaires increasing their share of the GDP by 7.6 percentage points in just four years.\nSt. Onge said the Fed's policies have been political in nature, while remarking he would welcome \"naive\" Democrats who bang the proverbial campaign drum of income inequality to jump onto the \"end the Fed bandwagon.\"\n\"They have a naive argument where they look at rich people and they say, \u2018Hey, this is so terrible. We live in this dog-eat-dog jungle of an economy,'\" St. Onge said of Democrats who campaign on income inequality. \"And that is inaccurate,\" he added, citing Federal Reserve policies that have amplified income inequality.\nOn the opposite side of the political coin, Vice PresidentJD Vancehas railed against the Biden administration and \"Wall Street barons\" for policies he said have hurt the working class. During his acceptance speech after officially becoming the vice presidential nominee in July, Vance said an affordability crisis is strangling the working class, while touting that theTrump administrationwould end economic \"catering to Wall Street.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Wall Street barons crashed the economy and American builders went out of business,\" Vance said from Milwaukee in summer 2024. \"As tradesmen scrambled for jobs, houses stopped being built. The lack of good jobs, of course, led to stagnant wages. And then the Democrats flooded this country with millions of illegal aliens. So citizens had to compete \u2013 with people who shouldn't even be here \u2013 for precious housing. Joe Biden's inflation crisis, my friends, is really an affordability crisis.\"\nThe Federal Reserve Board declined comment when approached by Fox Digital regarding St. Onge's and Hanke's remarks.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/billionaires-boomed-biden-era-fed-became-engine-income-inequality-powered-pandemic-policies"}

Mike Dunleavy reacts to President Trump's call for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund and ways it could potentially benefit the American people.\nAmerica\u2019s economic future hinges onenergy security, supply chain resilience, and strategic investment in infrastructure. As global markets shift and federal policymakers seek solutions to boost U.S. competitiveness, Alaska has implemented policies that enhance economic resilience, attract investment, and solidify our role as a key driver of national growth.\nUnder theBiden administration, burdensome regulations and restrictive permitting processes hindered growth, deterring investment and delaying key infrastructure projects. However, with the Trump administration once again acting as a force multiplier for economic expansion, Alaska is making tremendous strides to unlock its full potential.\nAlaska\u2019s competitive advantagesare rooted in a framework designed to ensure responsible resource development while prioritizing economic growth. Our vast reserves of oil, gas, timber, and minerals provide reliable access to critical resources essential to manufacturing, defense, and technology industries.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP'S ALASKA PIPELINE COULD FUEL AMERICA'S ENERGY NEEDS AND HIS LEGACY\nSince theTrump administrationtook office, Alaska has made significant progress in streamlining permitting processes, reducing bureaucratic obstacles that have historically stifled investment. The Alaska LNG project, a cornerstone of our long-term energy strategy, is now advancing with critical federal approvals, allowing us to bring American natural gas to global markets including Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan, which recently signed a letter of intent to purchase LNG.\nTrade and economic expansion reinforce Alaska\u2019s role as a national asset. From 2013 to 2022, Alaska\u2019s imports surged by 164 percent, increasing from $1.4 billion to $3.7 billion, while exports rose by 24 percent, from $4.5 billion to $5.6 billion. The result is a $1.9 billion trade surplus, underscoring the state\u2019s growing importance in global commerce. Additionally, Alaska\u2019s economy has grown more than 40 percent since 2000, with GDP rising from $38.5 billion to $54.1 billion in 2023.\nInfrastructure investment further enhances Alaska\u2019s ability to compete in the global economy, as we work to modernize ports, airports, and broadband networks. Thefederal government\u2019srenewed focus on reshoring supply chains underscores the importance of states like Alaska that have the capacity and natural resources to support domestic production. In response, our administration has actively worked to secure federal funding for infrastructure projects that will improve transportation networks and connectivity, ensuring that businesses investing in Alaska have the logistical support they need to thrive.\nAlaska is uniquely positioned to meet growing national demands for space access and missile defense, thanks in large part to the Alaska Aerospace Corporation (AAC). Operating the Pacific Spaceport Complex on Kodiak Island, one of only four vertical orbital launch sites in the U.S., AAC offers unmatched capabilities for hypersonic system testing and secure space launch in a low-congestion environment. With its vast geography, strategic location, and proven expertise, Alaska is primed to expand its role in strengthening America's space and defense infrastructure.\nAlaska is also emerging as a prime location for data center development, offering a unique opportunity for domestic and international companies seeking secure, energy-efficient locations for digital infrastructure. With a cool climate that reduces cooling costs, abundant renewable and conventional energy sources, and proximity to both U.S. and international markets, Alaska is an ideal location for data centers that require reliability, security, and sustainability.\nWorkforce development initiatives are expanding to ensure that Alaskans have access to high-paying jobs in emerging industries, from energy to advanced manufacturing. By partnering with industry leaders and educational institutions, we are creating pathways for skills training and certification programs that align with the needs of modern industries. This commitment to workforce readiness is critical in ensuring that Alaska\u2019s economy remains competitive and that opportunities created through resource development directly benefit our residents.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nUnlike restrictive mandates that stifle innovation, our approach, The Alaska Standard balances resource development with conservation, ensuring long-term sustainability while maximizing economic opportunity. This model reinforces that responsible development and environmental stewardship can coexist, benefiting both present and future generations. Our constitutionally protected Permanent Fund Dividend is a direct example of how Alaska ensures that the benefits of resource development flow directly to its people rather than enriching foreign adversaries.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAlaska is taking decisive action to enhance economic vitality and competitiveness. Whether through energy, mining, technology, aerospace or infrastructure, we are creating an environment where investment is not only welcomed but encouraged. The progress being made today is a testament to what is possible when state and federal policies align to support innovation, growth, and opportunity.\nWith a renewed commitment to these principles, Alaska is helping to shape the next chapter of America\u2019s economic success. We encourage those looking to make long-term, strategic investments to recognize that Alaska is not just a resource-rich state, it is a blueprint for how American innovation and economic growth can be responsibly achieved in the 21st century.\nRepublican Mike Dunleavy is governor of Alaska.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/americas-last-frontier-our-most-strategic-investment"}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nAt the dawn of what was billed as a new American \"Golden Age,\" PresidentDonald Trumpstood before the nation and proclaimed, \"The American Dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.\"\nThat was January 20, 2025. Now, just a few months into this new chapter, it's worth asking: What does a thriving American Dream actually require? It\u2019s not built on speeches or slogans, but on the everyday systems that support working families \u2014 schools, hospitals, firehouses and other vital services that keep our communities strong and our local economies growing.\nTake a walk through any thriving town or city in America. You will find not just businesses booming and cranes dotting the skyline. You'll find hospitals staffed by highly skilled nurses, public schools filled with ambitious children, public health departments tracking outbreaks before they spread and fire departments ready to respond within minutes.\nTRUMP ADMIN REINSTATES 9/11 SURVIVORS PROGRAM STAFF FOLLOWING HHS REORGANIZATION PLAN\nYou'll also find community colleges and public universities acting as launch pads for young adults entering the workforce. These are not just services. They are the living, breathing organs of a healthy, functioning economy.\nFire departments and other first responders are the backbone of a functioning society.\nThis isn\u2019t just theory. It\u2019s personal. My mother, a retired NICU nurse, spent decades caring for the smallest lives at Jackson Memorial Hospital inMiami. She was a proud member of SEIU Local 1991. Like many Jamaican-American women in healthcare, she wasn\u2019t just a registered nurse \u2014 she was a community builder, a public servant and the backbone of our neighborhood.Her union carddidn\u2019t just signify fair pay; it represented dignity, stability and a stake in America\u2019s future.\nPolicymakers across the political spectrum often talk about revitalizing American industry and rebuilding the middle class. Many Americans \u2014 especially those in the political middle, who feel disconnected from the extremes of both parties \u2014 are simply looking for practical solutions. They\u2019re not chasing culture wars or partisan fights; they want what works:good jobs, strong schools, and safe, stable communities.\nBut manufacturing doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. You can\u2019t build a factory in a town where the hospital has closed, the school is underfunded, the firehouse is short-staffed, and the technical college has shuttered because of federal budget cuts. Just ask any titan of industry.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 449,000 job openings in the manufacturing sector as of March 2025. These are real jobs that require real people with real skills. Yet, we lack the workforce to fill them. Why? Because we\u2019ve spent the past decade underfunding the very institutions that grow, train and sustain that workforce.\nOne bipartisan bright spot iscareer and technical education (CTE).As a recent New York Times opinion piece by AFT President Randi Weingarten highlighted, CTE is having a moment. Bringing together leaders like Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and business leaders like Satya Nadella, theCEO of Microsoft, CTE could catalyze the kind of revitalization many Americans are calling for.\nTo make that a reality, it must expand with the support of our most significant national resource: the federal government. A robust, federally supported career and technical education system could help resolve nursing shortages, address crises in emergency services and build a new generation of skilled tradespeople. But education doesn\u2019t just begin at age 18.\nPublic schools are the first rung on the ladder. Yet, under the latest federal budget proposal, funding forpublic K-12 schoolsis set to take a massive hit. One billion dollars for student mental health services? Gone. Programs aimed at closing achievement gaps and supporting students with disabilities? Slashed.\nThis isn\u2019t belt-tightening. This is misaligned priority-setting.\nEducation remains an essential part of a successful economy. And career and technical education has bipartisan support.(iStock)\nOur schools are already overwhelmed. Teachers are leaving the profession in droves. School nurses, counselors and support staff are being cut or forced to cover multiple roles. In some districts, students show up to class hungry, traumatized and with nowhere to turn. And the federal government\u2019s answer is to cut more?\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nWe can\u2019t build a 21st Century workforce without 21st Century schools. We can\u2019t have a strong manufacturing base without strong community colleges. We can\u2019t train the next generation of emergency responders if we\u2019re defunding the very programs that would prepare them. A factory job may require technical skill, but the journey to that skill begins in a kindergarten classroom.\nWhen some lawmakers talk about \"freedom,\" they often forget that freedom is meaningless without infrastructure. What good is the freedom to choose your doctor if there are no doctors in your town? What does school choice mean if your local public school is being bled dry by underinvestment and neglect?\nAmerica\u2019s prosperity has always rested on a simple formula: invest in people, invest in places, and the profits will follow. The towns that are thriving today are those that never stopped believing in that equation. They fought to keep their schools open, their hospitals staffed, their libraries funded and their civic fabric intact.\nBut manufacturing doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. You can\u2019t build a factory in a town where the hospital has closed, the school is underfunded, the firehouse is short-staffed, and the technical college has shuttered because of federal budget cuts. Just ask any titan of industry.\nIf we truly want to restore American greatness, we must recognize that it isn\u2019t built solely on tax breaks andtariffs. It\u2019s built in the maternity wards, classrooms, firehouses and community colleges that serve as the foundation of working-class life.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCutting for the sake of cutting isn\u2019t policy. It\u2019s performance art. And forworking familieslike the one I grew up in, it\u2019s not just shortsighted \u2014 it\u2019s dangerous.\nTo restore the American Dream, we need more than rhetoric. We need reinvestment. In schools. In hospitals. In people. In hope.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nOne ofPresident Donald Trump's most significant achievementsduring his first 100 days in office was his\u00a0executive order\u00a0requiring \"radical\" healthcare price transparency. The order doubles down on his first-term\u00a0hospital\u00a0and\u00a0health insurance\u00a0price transparency rules requiring the publication of actual prices of care and coverage, including discounted cash and negotiated insurance rates.\nThis informationprotects patients from overchargesand empowers them to reduce inflated costs through choice and competition. The executive order requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Department of the Treasury to issue rules strengthening, standardizing and enforcing systemwide price transparency by the end of this month.\nTrump's healthcare price transparency effort will revolutionize healthcareand the entire economy.It's a pro-worker, pro-growth, free-market policy to boost worker paychecks and business earnings.\n5.5 MILLION PATIENTS' INFORMATION EXPOSED BY MAJOR HEALTHCARE DATA BREACH\nWhen employers and unions can access actual prices throughout the healthcare system, they can spot wide price variations for the same care, expose middle players driving up costs and design affordable health plans. They can share their savings with workers in the form of lower premiums and higher wages.\nPresident Donald Trump''s healthcare Executive Order is aimed at a billing transparency. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\nUnder the status quo, healthcare is fundamentally un-American. It is the only economic sector where consumers cannot see real prices before they buy.\nNo functioning market can exist under these conditions. As a result, prices for the same care can range by 10 times, even at the same hospital.\nFor instance, C-sections varyfrom $6,000 to $60,000and MRIs from\u00a0$450 to $6,500. That isn't a marketplace \u2014 it's Russian Roulette that allows Big Health to profiteer off patients' misery.\nFor decades, health insurers have hidden prices and claims information, facilitating spread pricing that robs workers and employers. Employer-sponsored family health plans now cost $25,600 annually\u00a0and increase by\u00a0double-digits\u00a0each year. Research\u00a0shows\u00a0that about the same amount of compensation gains for average workers since 2000 has gone to premiums as paychecks, a major cause of wage stagnation.\nUnfortunately, hospitals and health insurers haven't complied with Trump's first-term rules. According to a recent study by\u00a0PatientRightsAdvocate.org,\u00a0only 21.1%\u00a0of hospitals nationwide are fully complying with the hospital rule.\nThe Biden administration didn't meaningfully enforce the rule, issuing\u00a0only 25 financial penalties\u00a0on the thousands of hospitals that didn't comply. Biden also\u00a0rolled back\u00a0the rule, allowing the posting of unaccountable estimates in lieu of actual prices needed to shop. And health insurers have buried their data disclosures in massive files full of\u00a0meaningless \"ghost codes\"\u00a0that crash computers and are nearly impossible to parse.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nTrump's new order increases enforcement to boost compliance, requires actual prices \u2014 not estimates\u00a0\u2014\u00a0so patients can shop with financial certainty, expands transparency requirements throughout the healthcare system, and standardizes data disclosures, so consumers can make meaningful price comparisons. It gives people prices before they receive care.\nTrump's order will also enact overdue requirements for health insurers to provide Advanced Explanations of Benefits (AEOBs), required by the bipartisan\u00a0No Surprises Act\u00a0that passed at the end of 2020. AEOBs let patients know exactly what they'll owe \u2014 including their out-of-pocket patient responsibility \u2014 giving them financial peace of mind.\nUnder the status quo, healthcare is fundamentally un-American. It is the only economic sector where consumers cannot see real prices before they buy.\nThey also empower employers and unions to audit their health plans and verify claims payments match provider bills and posted prices. Employers and unions can then eliminate spread pricing that\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as the New York Times\u00a0reported last year\u00a0\u2014 often requires their health plans to pay far more to middle players than providers.\nDrawing on a JAMA study concluding that 25% of U.S. healthcare spending ($4.9 trillion in 2023) is waste, overcharges, and fraud, economists estimate systemwide price transparency can generate approximately $1 trillion of savings. Putting $1 trillion a year in overbilling back into\u00a0the productive economy, including worker paychecks and business investment, will result in an enormous annual economic stimulus.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHealthcare price transparency is the most important microeconomic reform in American history. It creates a functional, competitive marketplace that restores choice, accountability and trust. When prices are clear, markets work. When markets work, costs fall. And when costs fall, wages rise.\nPresident Trump's executive order \u2014\u00a0and the ensuing federal rules issued later in May \u2014will finally make healthcare price transparency a reality.

(Credit: Bishop Robert Barron)\nAmerican author, speaker and theologian Bishop Robert Barron was at the Vatican this week to witness the election of a new pope, and he shared his thoughts with Fox News Digital about Cardinal Robert Prevost's \"intriguing\" new papal name.\nPapal names are often very symbolic with regard to how a Pope will serve as the leader of the Catholic Church. Typically, Pope's select the names of predecessors they admire or want to emulate. Prevost ultimately went withLeo XIVin honor of Pope Leo XIII, who served from 1878 to 1903.\n\"He could have been Francis II, and we would have said, \u2018Oh, there he is clearly in the line of Francis.\u2019 He could have been John Paul III, then we would have thought, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s very much in that more conservative line.' He could have been John XXIV, and we say \u2018Oh, now he\u2019s a real revolutionary liberal, et cetera,'\" Barron said. \"The fact that he went back, well over 100 years, to this very interesting and pivotal figure \u2026 our new pope was saying, I too, want a critical engagement with the modern world, not simply a \u2018no,\u2019 but also not simply a \u2018yes,\u2019 not simply an acquiescence to it.\"\nCARDINAL DOLAN DESCRIBES POPE XIV AS \u2018CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,\u2019 WILL BUILD BRIDGES WITH TRUMP\nFrom left to right: Pope John XXIII, Pope John Paul II, Pope Francis I, Pope Leo XIV(Getty Images/Fox News)\nBarron pointed out that Leo XIII was a pivotal figure due to the timing of his reign, which came during a moment whenthe Churchwas contending with the tremendous political and philosophical upheavals of the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the French and American Revolutions, and the introduction of philosophies such as Marxism.\n\"The church's first reaction [to these changes] was very negative. It was a great \u2018no\u2019 to modernity. By the end of the 19th century, I think, with a certain distance and a certain critical intelligence, the church was willing to enter into a more, call it, creative engagement with modernity. And I think Pope Leo the 13th represents precisely that,\" Barron said.\nThe bishop pointed to the Rerum Novarum to further his point, an encyclical letter issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891.\nBEARS STAR CALEB WILLIAMS ISSUES TWO-WORDED REACTION TO POPE LEO XIV'S ELECTION\n\"In that document, [Leo XIII] is a fierce opponent of Marxism, a fierce opponent of socialism and communism, a great defender of private property and of the market economy,\" Barron said. \"So you say, 'Okay, there's that great \u2018no\u2019 to the left-wing economic revolutions.' At the same time, in that same letter, [Leo XIII] comes out strongly in favor of the right toform unions.He comes out very strongly in favor of what we call the universal destination of goods.\"\nNewly elected Pope Leo XIV (Right) took his papal name from the late-19th century Pope Leo XIII (Left).(Getty Images/Fox News)\n\"In fact, Pope Leo says in that letter, once the requirements of necessity and propriety have been met in your life, the rest of what you own belongs to the poor,\" Barron continued. \"That's not a just a standard, boring, mainstream point of view. That's a pretty revolutionary statement. But notice the lovely balance in that letter between \u2018yes\u2019 to private property, the great \u2018no\u2019 to socialism and Marxism, but the great \u2018yes\u2019 to the universal destination of goods. Leo sets the tone thereby for the rest ofCatholic social teachingthat followed him.\"\nIn conclusion, Barron said he thinks Prevost's selection of Leo XIV makes the new pope \"a very interesting player\" in terms of the debate between the Right and the Left in politics.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"[Leo XIV] doesn't fit \u2013 and I've said this 1,000 times \u2013 he and other great representatives of Catholic social teaching don't fit into our categories of left and right,\" Barron said. \"They don't fit into Democrat-Republican, they're in a space beyond those distinctions.

And for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower thanthat of the GOP,which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable.\nThe figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys.\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING\nThe Fox News poll is far from an outlier.\nThe Democratic Party's favorable ratings were well in negative territory in a Pew Research national survey - 38% favorable, 60% unfavorable - conducted in early April and at 36% favorable, 60% unfavorable in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field a couple of weeks earlier.\nAnd national polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University and March by CNN and by NBC News also indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows.\nBut there's more.\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., right, is joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for a press conference in Statuary Hall at the Capitol on Feb. 12, 2025.

And Republicans made gains among Black andHispanic votersas well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base.\nSince Trump's return to power, an increasingly angry and energized base of Democrats is pushing for party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration.\n\"What we've seen over the last few months is some Democrats taking it upon themselves to tackle what has been a larger brand problem over the past decade and a half,\" a Democrat strategist and communicator who's a veteran of presidential campaigns told Fox News.\nThe anger not only at Trump and Republicans but also at fellow Democrats appears to be a factor in the party's polling woes, with the drop in positivity toward the Democrats in the Fox News poll partially being a self-inflicted wound. Party favorability among self-identified Democrats plunged 10 points from last summer (87%) to last month (77%) in the survey.\nAt the same time, the Republican Party saw a slight improvement among their party faithful: 83% of self-identified Republicans had a favorable view in 2024 vs. 85% in April.\nFox News polling shows the Democratic Party performing poorly in approval even among self-identified Democrats.(Fox News)\nBut there's a silver lining for the Democrats.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The higher favorable rating for the Republican Party is entirely due to Democrats feeling less favorable toward their party than Republicans do toward theirs,\" said Democrat pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. \"This in and of itself is unlikely to translate into midterm success for the GOP as Democrats say they will almost universally vote for their party and independents favor the Democrats as well.\"\nThe Fox News poll indicates that if the 2026 midterm elections were held today, 49% of voters would back a generic Democrat in their congressional district, with 42% supporting the generic Republican candidate.\nFox News' Victoria Balara contributed to this report.\nPaul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

{"title": "DEI is dead. Here's what should come next", "date": "2025-05-07", "body": "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller vowed that President Donald Trump's administration will bring an end to DEI \"strangulation.\"\nWhen President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s later-Vice President Hubert Humphrey championed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he exclaimed, \"I will eat my hat if this leads to racial quotas.\" Following the meteoric rise of DEI over the past few years,Humphrey would need a new hat.\nNow, the DEI fad is rightly fading. The Supreme Court overturned affirmative action.Corporations jettisoned DEIupon realizing it improved neither workplace culture nor the bottom line. President Donald Trump eliminated DEI in government and is rooting out remaining discriminatory DEI practices in the private sector.\nBut what\u2019s truly remarkable isn\u2019t DEI\u2019s demise, butthe extraordinary uniformity of its adoption \u2014uniformity that, once dismantled, will allow for a plurality of policies for hiring, promoting and retaining the right workforce, tailored to each companies\u2019 individual goals.\nTRUMP'S CRACKDOWN ON HARVARD, 'WOKE' COLLEGES WILL TAKE MORE THAN 100 DAYS TO LEAVE LASTING REFORM: PROFESSOR\nMake no mistake, the DEI orthodoxy demanded faithful allegiance to a narrow set of rules. When 2,500 CEOs signed the identical \"CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion\" pledge, they committed their companies to identical practices like holding unconscious bias trainings and making \"progress\" on demographic metrics \u2014 regardless of how these policies might affect their specific businesses.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are dead. The big issue is what comes next.(Adobe Stock)\nLGBTQ+ organizations like the Human Rights Campaign established scoring systems that effectively required companies to offer employees identical transgender medical benefits packages to earn a coveted \"100% rating\" \u2014 practices that in any other context might raise antitrust concerns.\nThis conformity defied business logic. No company would adopt identical marketing strategies or pricing models as their competitors \u2014 yet somehow, they embraced identical approaches to what\u2019s arguably their most crucial asset: their employees.\nChief Talent Officers and HR departments responsible for implementing, and now dismantling, DEI efforts should be leaders in what follows \u2014 a flourishing of new ideas and methods to identify and retain the best and brightest employees based on their skills and cultural fit.\nThis ability to innovate should be welcome. The DEI movement stifled innovation in human resource departments. Every company says they want to attract great employees and build a winning culture. Corporate executives know engaged employees are the difference between top and bottom quartile performing companies.\nYet 73% of publicly traded U.S. companies adopted increasingly rigid DEI commitments. Companies as diverse as SalesForce, Target, Coca-Cola and Bank of America implemented hiring quotas, exclusive race-based access programs, and/or implicit bias training under the DEI banner.\nNo other department saw the mass adoption of the same ideology. There are thousands of methods for sales teams to increase revenue. ABC \u2014\u00a0Always Be Closing. SPIN Selling\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Situation, Problem, Implication and Need-payoff. PLG - Product Led Growth, etc.\nMarketing departments also have endless ways to reach new customers. Three C\u2019s \u2013 Company, Customer, Competitor. Four P\u2019s \u2013 Product, Price, Place, Promotion. Five M\u2019s \u2013 Mission, Money, Message, Media and Measurement.\nFinanciers are always dreaming up new and exotic ways to value companies (remember WeWork\u2019s \"Community Adjusted EBITDA\" metric?); in their eyes, GAAP is not a standard to be met, but a challenge to be overcome. Yet HR departments across the nation got stuck with the same-old DEI.\nSalesforce.com embraced hiring quotas only to drop them later. FILE: Marc Benioff, chief executive officer of Salesforce.com Inc., speaks during a keynote at the 2023 Dreamforce conference in San Francisco, California, on Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023.(Marlena Sloss/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nNow market observers are asking what comes next. But the question isn't \"what single approach replaces DEI?\" but rather \"why should there be a singular approach?\"\nThere\u2019s good reason to be skeptical of replacing one universal mandate with another. Consider what happens when central planning ends in any sector: innovation flourishes. When the government broke up AT&T\u2019s monopoly in the 1980s, telecommunications transformed from a stagnant utility to the dynamic foundation of the digital economy. When the government deregulated the airlines in the 1970s, air travel became within reach of middle-class Americans.\nThe end of DEI's monopoly on talent strategy promises a similar renaissance, so long as companies are willing to experiment to find the right approach to meet their unique needs.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nForward-thinking companies are already taking the plunge. Some tech companies are adopting MEI \u2013 Merit, Excellence, Intelligence. Maybe police and fire departments want to adopt BRAVE \u2013 Bold, Reliable, Accountable, Vigilant, Empathetic. Healthcare workers could adopt CARE \u2013 Compassionate, Adaptable, Respectful, Empowered. Construction companies could recruit for STEEL \u2013 Skilled, Trustworthy, Efficient, Enduring, Leaders. There are endless opportunities for companies to clearly articulate who is a good fit for their organization.\nThis isn\u2019t abandoning workplace diversity \u2014 it\u2019s enabling its most meaningful form. Research has consistently shown that cognitive diversity \u2014 that is, differences in how people think, rather than how they look \u2014 increases innovation, creativity and problem-solving. Companies that cultivate this deeper form of diversity will be positioned to outperform.\nThere will also be greater diversity in hiring approaches more broadly. Some companies may focus on recruiting overlooked talent from Appalachia or first-generation college students. Others might emphasize retention and internal development. Some may adopt high-churn models that rapidly test talent on the job. A few might maintain their grip on their race- and gender-focused DEI policies \u2014 albeit with increased legal risk. Companies will experiment, and the free market will decide who wins.\nThe DEI movement stifled innovation in human resource departments. Every company says they want to attract great employees and build a winning culture.\nThis approach mirrors America's greatest economic success stories. When soldiers returned from World War II, President Harry Truman didn't send them all to dig ditches. They became entrepreneurs, factory workers, artists and inventors \u2014 and unleashed the greatest economic boom in American history. Similarly, as companies are freed from DEI's rigid orthodoxy, they can develop individual approaches to building workforces that they believe will maximize their chances for future success.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCompanies will of course have to apply metrics to their chosen strategies to evaluate performance, but individuals should be recruited and promoted based on whatever race- and gender-neutral criteria their company has set. This will lead to better employee fit, lower turnover and improved corporate performance. It will also make good on the Civil Rights Act\u2019s promise to eliminate discrimination, while rendering race and gender quotas a relic of the past.\nEven Hubert Humphrey would take off his hat to that.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANSON FRERICKS\nAnson Frericks is the co-founder of Strive Asset Management and the author of,\"Last Call for Bud Light.\"", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dei-dead-heres-what-should-come-next"}

{"title": "Trump\u2019s latest move proves his manufacturing Golden Age is just fools\u2019 gold", "date": "2025-05-06", "body": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the Trump administration\u2019s tariff negotiations with China and more on \u2018Special Report.\u2019\nPresident Donald Trump continues to promisethat his tariff regime will usher in a new Golden Age for American workers with an explosion of high-paying manufacturing jobs across the Rust Belt and America.\u00a0 These tariffs will certainly drive up the costs of imports, hurting American consumers. As demand for foreign goods declines, the unfairly maligned trade deficit targeted by the president may indeed narrow. But more expensive imports also guarantee the supposed manufacturing renaissance will turn out to be fools\u2019 gold for American workers and will not boost exports.\nContrary to popular belief,American exporters have enjoyeda manufacturing renaissance. Since 1994, American exports have nearly\u00a0tripled, even after you adjust for inflation.\nAmericangoods exported exceeded $2 trillionlast year. America\u2019s aerospace industry now exports nearly $100 billion a year. The American automotive sector exports more than\u00a0$160 billion annually, nearly doubling in inflation-adjusted terms since 1994. American soybean farmers supply livestock around the globe with feed. Each of these export-intensive sectors stands to lose jobs due to these tariffs.\nUS TRADE REPRESENTATIVE SAYS IT\u2019S A MATTER OF \u2018WEEKS\u2019 BEFORE NEW TRADE DEAL ANNOUNCEMENTS\nFirst, don\u2019t expect an overall gain in American manufacturing jobs. Certainly, individual companies may benefit. A tariff on steel might save a few jobs at a specific steel mill. But the cost for every American manufacturer using this higher-priced domestic steel will also increase.\nPresident Donald Trump holds a tariff chart comparing the U.S. and other nations.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\nAmerican manufacturing relies on a complex global supply chain utilizing imported parts. Automakers, construction firms and appliance makers all must pass this cost along \u2014 sometimes cutting wages or even jobs to stay afloat.\nNumerous American companies have already begun laying off American workers in response to the tariffs, including at\u00a0five Stellantis plants. Currently,\u00a0up to 30% of North American auto production\u00a0may be temporarily halted due to the tariff uncertainty. These headlines will become routine if the trade war continues.\nAmerican manufacturers, who export their American-made goods to the rest of the world, will fall behind as their input costs increase. This danger compounds as other nations retaliate against us by imposing their own barriers.\u00a0As American exporters find their market shares shrinking and costs rising, American companies will see their profits plunge and American jobs vanish.\nSecond, the limited tariff-created manufacturing jobs will not be better paid jobs. Good-paying jobs are contingent on productivity.\u00a0Higher tariffs lower labor productivity\u00a0as less efficient businesses are protected from competition.\nThanks largely to the innovation and efficiencies from free trade, our jobs market has diversified away from a concentration of jobs in a lower-paying, physically demanding industry. The burgeoning sectors have supplied tens of millions of Americans with opportunities in safer professions.\nProductivity\u00a0overall of workers doubled in just\u00a0the past 40 years. It\u2019s not just investors or managers who benefit as resources yield more output. Workers share in this abundance of affordable, available and diverse goods.\nOur so-called \"trade deficit\" has largely enabled this boom in newer, more productive jobs. The surplus dollars overseas generated by us importing more than we export flow back to the United States often in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) in businesses here \u2014 exploding more than 500% compared to thirty years ago to\u00a0more than $330 billion last year. If the president succeeds at eliminating this trade deficit, workers employed in these new jobs will suffer as foreign direct dries up.\nEconomic distortion caused by tariffs will shift jobs and resources to industries in which we lack a\u00a0comparative\u00a0economic advantage. As government policies deploy resources to less efficient businesses, more individuals will be forced to take these less desirable jobs.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer poses with Tandy Jeckel, owner of TandyWear, at her flagship store in Commack, Long Island, NY, on Thursday, April 24, 2025. Jeckel is a Trump voter who is unhappy with the raising of tariffs.(Rashid Umar Abbasi for Fox News Digital)\nThe overall decline in business output translates not only to less profit; it yields less take-home pay and consumption for middle-class families. Workers will be harmed by this shift to lower-paying jobs.\nContrast this world of fewer, lower-paying jobs with a competitive environment which ensures that over time, each employee can produce more without working more. Business owners, employees and consumers all benefit. Higher prices on imported goods will not magically make American manufacturers more efficient or innovative. Quite the inverse!\nBy shielding them from competition, these businesses will grow complacent \u2014 with less incentive to improve, cut costs, and deliver better products at lower prices. As productivity declines, the standard of living for workers will also decline.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe ingredients for a flourishing manufacturing sector are lower regulations, lower taxes and more freedom to trade with others. In fact, many jobs returned to the USA after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) because America became more competitive with the rest of the world.\nEmbracing even part of this recipe has created a \"Golden Age\" for the past 40 years. Millions of people who would have previously worked in lower-paying factory jobs, now work in higher-paying, advanced services.\nIn fact, we now export far more of these services than we import. For this reason, the typical American family enjoys an annual income $26,000 greater\u00a0than just one generation ago. A record percentage of young adults are participating in our stronger economy.\nTariffs are a roadblock to prosperity, not a highway.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe overall decline in business output translates not only to less profit; it yields less take-home pay and consumption for middle-class families. Workers will be harmed by this shift to lower-paying jobs.\nWe\u2019ve been here before: Look at the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930. It was meant to protect American industry, but it prolonged the Great Depression by choking global trade. The layoffs, price hikes, financial carnage and cratering approval ratings caused by this historic tax increase may cajole the president into soon relenting.\nIf not,\u00a0the promised manufacturing jobs will come at the expense of jobs elsewhere and be far fewer in number than promised. We will produce less, consume less and earn less. The Golden Age will deliver nothing but fools\u2019 gold: Politically caused scarcity in an age of abundance.\nJoel Griffith is a senior fellow at Advancing American Freedom.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARC SHORT\nMarc Short is the former director of Legislative Affairs for President Donald Trump.

{"title": "This is how Donald Trump can terminate tariff turmoil", "date": "2025-05-04", "body": "Economist Steve Moore discusses President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policy and the April jobs report on \u2018Fox Report.\u2019\nThis past April has been one of the most volatile months in stock market history, thanks to the Trump administration\u2019s botched rollout of its so-called reciprocal tariff rates. However, this tariff threat has at least succeeded in bringing other nations to the negotiating table \u2013 and now, the best way to restore calm is by letting Trump do what he does best: negotiate.\nThat\u2019s a difficult pill to swallow for businesses likeAmazon, which is addicted to artificially cheap imports from nations like China. Instead of pressuring Chinese vendors to cut costs or force the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the negotiating table, Amazon has been flirting with pressuring the Trump administration to drop the whole tariff fight altogether.\nRecently, for example, officials in the company were debating whether to display a so-called \"tariff cost\" along with the price of items for sale. Amazon called this transparency \u2013 but nothing could be further from the truth.\nAMAZON DENIES TARIFF PRICING PLAN THAT WHITE HOUSE CALLED 'HOSTILE AND POLITICAL'\nFor one thing, where was this \"transparency\" when former presidentJoe Biden\u2019sfour-decade-high inflation caused consumer prices to explode?\nAnecdotally, some products that I used to buy on the site doubled in price during Biden\u2019s tenure. Yet Amazon never dared tell consumers what portion of these price increases was caused by Biden\u2019s overspending.\nSimilarly, when Biden exploded regulatory compliance costs (which also directly impacted consumer prices), Amazon never told consumers how much of their bill at checkout was from overregulation. Folks never saw an \"inflation cost\" or \"regulation cost\" while Biden was president.\nTREASURY SECRETARY BESSENT SIGNALS US ADVANTAGE IN TARIFF BATTLE AS CHINA'S ECONOMY CRUMBLES\nNot only that, but where would Amazon even get the data needed to display the effect of tariffs on the cost of individual items?\nThis information certainly can\u2019t come from Chinese vendors. Anyone attached to the CCP is consistently pressured to lie and publish falsified data.\nIronically, it\u2019s more important that we make these trade deals with China\u2019s key trading partners than with our own. By peeling nations like India, Japan, and Australia out of China\u2019s sphere of influence, Trump can isolate the CCP and force them to their knees.\nInstead, finding information about (for example) the amount China exports requires finding how much every other nation is importing fromChinaand adding those figures. Only then can one gain a better sense of whether the \"official\" CCP data is accurate.\nUnfortunately, even such a painstaking method is imperfect because the CCP can pressure other totalitarian states to either falsify or neglect to publish relevant data. China itself simply stopped publishing unemployment data when the figures got too ugly for the CCP\u2019s liking.\nBUFFETT CRITICIZES TRUMP'S TARIFFS ROLLOUT, SAYS US SHOULDN\u2019T USE 'TRADE AS A WEAPON'\nAmazon has since backed away from the idea of displaying estimated \"tariff costs\" on its site. But even the discussion of such an idea speaks to how spooked markets are about potential tariffs.\nIf PresidentDonald Trumpis not able to make any deals before the end of the 90-day pause, the ensuing tariffs will amount to a massive tax increase on American consumers and foreign producers alike, grinding economic growth to a halt.\nBut Trump failing to negotiate isn\u2019t at all a foregone conclusion. In fact, we\u2019ve recently seen extremely positive developments with key trading partners like India and Japan.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS: COMPANIES THAT WILL INVEST $1B OR MORE IN THE US\nIn other words, there\u2019s plenty of economic runway left (as Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentput it recently), and Trump can still safely land this plane.\nWhat exactly does that look like? In short, it means signing bilateral trade deals with key trading partners to both guarantee American consumers can still access a wide variety of affordable products from abroad and ensure that American exporters can finally access to foreign consumer markets.\nIronically, it\u2019s more important that we make these trade deals with China\u2019s key trading partners than with our own. By peeling nations like India, Japan, and Australia out of China\u2019s sphere of influence, Trump can isolate the CCP and force them to their knees. Despite what China\u2019s government reports may say, the country\u2019s economy is already vulnerable and hurting \u2013 it cannot afford a drawn-out trade war.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nTrump and Bessent still have economic runway to get this done and alleviate all the tariff turmoil in the coming weeks and months.\nIf they succeed in doing so \u2013 at the same time as they seek to shepherd a massive tax cut through Congress and deregulate at breakneck speed \u2013 America will be headed to the promised Golden Age, meaning more American jobs and a lower cost of living.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIf the Trump administration pulls this off, will Amazon show consumers how much their prices have decreased thanks to Trump\u2019s success?\nLet\u2019s not hold our breath.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM E.J.ANTONI\nE.J.

{"title": "REP. MIKE KELLY, SEN. TIM SCOTT AND SECRETARY SCOTT TURNER: Save the Opportunity Zones before it\u2019s too late", "date": "2025-04-30", "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nIn 2017, Congress passed one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in the last quarter-century. When President Donald Trump signed theTax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA),the law spurred economic growth the United States hadn\u2019t seen in a generation. Wages increased, and unemployment decreased. Americans were able to cash their paychecks and go home to their families with more money in their pockets.\nNow, eight years later, major TCJA provisions are up for renewal. Among them:Opportunity Zones,a successful, bipartisan piece of legislation that is transforming underserved communities in real time.\u00a0 Opportunity Zones have made an incredible impact across our nation.\nThe Opportunity Zone (OZ) initiative allows investors from all over the United States toinvest their capital gains earningsin economically distressed communities where new investments can be eligible for preferential capital gains tax treatment. Instead of sitting idle in a brokerage or bank account, this money is put to work in communities that have not seen significant private investment for some time.\nGOP PUSH TO MAKE TRUMP\u2019S 2017 TAX CUTS PERMANENT, SAY GOING BACK WOULD BE A \u2018DRAMATIC\u2019 CHANGE FOR MANY\nThis pro-growth tax policy offers crucial incentives that do not cost American taxpayers a single cent. In 2017, this kind of policy may have seemed unbelievable to some within the Beltway. Despite the skepticism, OZs are actively transforming communities and creating economic opportunities for families in the poorest zip codes.\nPresident Donald Trump's Tax Cuts & Jobs Act spurred economic growth.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nErie, Pennsylvania may best exemplify the economic benefits and the tangible changes Opportunity Zones can create in a relatively short period of time. In 2018, the city\u2019s downtown ZIP code, 16501, was named the poorest in Pennsylvania and among the poorest nationwide. \u00a0However, through the potential of OZs, the stigma of Pennsylvania\u2019s poorest ZIP code served as a springboard for investment in the area.\nShortly after TCJA was signed into law, a group of local residents recognized how Opportunity Zones could revitalize the city. Major employers, local universities and other organizations partnered to provide initial financial backing to form the Erie Downtown Development Corporation (EDDC).\nTo date, EDDC has leveraged more than $115 million in private investment into downtown Erie, which has built 108 new fully occupied residences, revitalized and created more than 100,000 square feet of new commercial space, and established space for 25 new businesses. Overall, $400 million of long-term capital investment is at work, breathing new life into Downtown Erie.\nThese investments have a proven track record of revitalizing small businesses and residential areas while fostering innovation in technology and manufacturing \u2014 an industry where South Carolina excels. Projects like the South Carolina Technology & Aviation Center (SCTAC) have generated over $6.1 billion in investments and created more than 18,000 new jobs in the local community. This further underscores the significance of Opportunity Zones, which have been and will continue to be impactful.\nAdditionally, Opportunity Zones have played a significant role in assisting the revitalization of previously overlooked communities, transforming them into economic powerhouses. In Oconee County, South Carolina, investors transformed a textile mill built in 1875 along Lake Hartwell into 197 new residential apartments. The project also incorporated retail and recreational amenities, including the restoration of the historic dam and the creation of public green spaces and trails.\nNationally, Opportunity Zones have generated$89 billionin private investment across more than 5,600 designated communities, and this investment spurred the creation of over 500,000 jobs in the first two years alone. According to a report released in March by the Economic Innovation Group (EIG), a bipartisan public policy organization based in Washington, D.C. The legislation also has a far-reaching impact \u2014 approximately one in 10 Americans live in an Opportunity Zone. That number could soon grow.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe EIG report also indicates that OZs \"caused an increase of 313,000 new residential addresses (not counting units currently under construction) in designated communities from Q3 2019 to Q3 2024 \u2013 roughly doubling the total amount of new housing added to these communities over that period.\"\nMoreover, the Council of Economic Advisors found that the Opportunity Zone designation alone caused a 3.4% increase in home values in these areas, which translated to an estimated tens of billions of dollars in new wealth for the Opportunity Zone residents who own their homes.\nIn 2018, the city\u2019s downtown ZIP code, 16501, was named the poorest in Pennsylvania and among the poorest nationwide. \u00a0However, through the potential of OZs, the stigma of Pennsylvania\u2019s poorest ZIP code served as a springboard for investment in the area.\nBy empowering the private sector and cutting red tape, Opportunity Zones enable projects to move more efficiently and at a lower cost while simultaneously addressing one of the most pressing needs in low-income communities \u2013 quality affordable housing.\nFrom the very start of the 2017 tax law, we knew the Opportunity Zones initiative would be a gamechanger. It was made for shovel-ready projects in neighborhoods that needed the help the most. As we look ahead to 2025, the future is bright in places like Erie and Oconee County. The EDDC is preparing to break ground on another $22 million project, which includes 37,000 square-feet for commercial office and retail space.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHowever, if Congress fails to extend TCJA and Opportunity Zones provisions expire, we could see projects years in the making completely upended overnight, along with the largest tax hike in modern history.\nIt\u2019s critical that Congress extend, expand and make the 2017 tax cuts permanent so working families, small businesses, and communities nationwide can continue to receive the benefits of this legislation \u2013 and tax cuts at large \u2013 for years to come.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

Even so, some prices have already risen in anticipation of higher costs under the new tariff regime.\nUncertainty has also played a role.Trump's tariff announcementin April prompted a number of large container ships to abruptly halt their shipments to the U.S. earlier this month and turn back to their original ports. This means that more consumers will see a price hike for everyday products, likely at certain big-box retailer stores like Walmart or Target, as early as next month.\nThese price hikes are \"not showing up tomorrow, but will show up over the next few months, as scarcities develop and American retailers have to find other sources \u2013 that might take a while,\" David H.

My 401(k) sure as hell isn\u2019t.\nOn January 20, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris left Donald Trump an economy that was outmatching every competitor. In October, The Economist magazine\u00a0called\u00a0America\u2019s economy \"the envy of the world,\" praising us for leaving \"other rich countries in the dust.\"\nBut America is nowon trackto have the lowest economic growth and the highest inflation of any leading nation.\nIn January, Trump guaranteed, \"we will turnthe economyaround very quickly,\" \"the United States is going to take off like a rocket ship,\" and \"inflation\" would fall. He also claimed he\u2019d stand up to a wealthy establishment that was taking advantage of middle-class families.\nTRUMP STEAMS AHEAD ON THESE CAMPAIGN PROMISES AS HE REACHES 100 DAYS IN OFFICE\nThe only promise he kept from those pre-inauguration pledges was to \"turn the economy around very quickly\" -- in the worst way. Trump\u2019s \"rocket ship\" exploded at takeoff. And the only Americans spared from his debris are crony capitalists who are effectively paying himbribes for exemptionsfrom an agenda that is devastating consumers and businesses.\nIt\u2019s been 100 straight days of breaking his word.\nAt the Republican National Convention, Trump said, \"I make this pledge to the great people of America. I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately\" and \"drive down prices.\"\nDemocrats have an opportunity to prove to the American people that we are listening to them; that\u00a0their\u00a0top priority -- the economic success of their families -- is also\u00a0our\u00a0top priority.\nBut we\u2019re all paying higher prices because of the biggest middle-class tax hike in modern history --Trump\u2019s tariffs. By definition, a tariff is a regressive tax that disproportionately hurts the non-wealthy. And Trump admits the revenue the government makes from his tariffs will be redistributed to fellow billionaires through the tax plan congressional Republicans are rushing to pass.\nSEN. ANGUS KING: A 'DECLARATION OF CONSCIENCE' ON DONALD TRUMP'S 100TH DAY\nTrump\u2019s tariff taxes are also killing the manufacturing jobs he claimed they would protect - atMack Truck factoriesin Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, atauto plants in Michigan and Indiana, and elsewhere. It\u2019s no surprise that amajorityof American manufacturing workers oppose Trump\u2019s tariffs. At the same time, Trump is knifing the policies that actuallyhadbeen revitalizing American manufacturing, like Biden\u2019s bipartisan China competitiveness law and the Inflation Reduction Act.\nTrump\u2019s broken promises and self-inflicted economic losses don\u2019t end there. He and congressional Republicans are plotting Medicaid and Affordable Care Act cuts. Trump let the richest man in the world cutSocial Security benefits. Trump\u2019s also slashing the investments that are the lifeblood of our technological and medical innovation edges. All of this is to make room for the tax cuts for the rich that his tariff taxes finance.\nAnd even though the rule of law, American courts, and the independence of the Federal Reserve are critical to keeping the United States as the top economy in the world, Trump is eroding all of those pillars. He\u2019s even raging against judges and other leaders he himself nominated, includingSupreme Courtjustices, law enforcement officials, andFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\nTaken together, Trump is weakening our economy so profoundly that he\u2019s setting-off the deadliest exodus of investment away from America since the 1940s. The dollar\u2019s status as the world\u2019s reserve currency -- an anchor of our economic strength thatChinaor Russia would literally kill for -- is in crisis and slipping away.\nBut while most of the country is suffering from this nosedive, Trump and his family are benefitting. They are exploiting their elite private clubs and businesses to sell safety from his economic train wreck -- like immunity from his tariff taxes.\nThis weekend, as polls from\u00a0NBC News,\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0ABC News, the\u00a0Associated Press, and more all backed upFox\u2019s own pollingabout the unpopularity of Trump\u2019s economic record, news broke that his son, Donald Trump Jr. is starting an exclusive new D.C. club literally called \"Executive Branch.\"\nPolitico\u00a0reports\u00a0that this club for the \"ultra-rich\" will \"cater to the business and tech moguls who are looking to nurture their relationships with the Trump administration.\" Membership costs $500,000. Days before, Trump himself announced that the top owners of his $TRUMP meme coin would be rewarded with a private dinner at his own D.C. club --generating an estimated $100 millionfor himself.\nThe Trump Crime Family is practically charging businesses for \"protection\" from itself.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nPresident Trump is double-crossing our nation, rapidly draining the American Dream that every other generation sacrificed to make possible. Which means Democrats have an opportunity to prove to the American people that we are listening to them; thattheirtop priority -- the economic success of their families -- is alsoourtop priority.\nWe\u2019ll do that by opposing Trump\u2019s price-raising middle-class tax hike that funds welfare for the rich. And by fighting to make the American Dream affordable -- lowering costs likehealth care, child care, and elder care by having billionaires and rich special interests pay their fair share in taxes.\nWe\u2019ll get Americans together with a shared national mission tomake our economy strongerthan ever by empowering our middle class and ensuring the industries of the future are falling over themselves to invest and build in America -- not running away, like Trump has them doing.\nThat\u2019s the shake-up we need and deserve.\nDemocrats will also recognize that the way we communicate -- and especially, the way you make people feel -- is just as important as what we have to say.\nThat means going everywhere, both online and geographically, across the country. It means being open about who we are on a personal level and proudly owning that the values we\u2019re advocating for are in line with the best traditions of American culture.\nSomeDemocrats-- not most, but some -- have mistakenly spent more time tearing America down than lifting it up, and alienating huge swaths of our country with divisive, counter-cultural elitism -- demeaning people of faith or even male voters as a whole. But that is not who we are.\nThere is nothing more American than pushing for aneconomyand society that provides opportunity and respect for everyone who works hard and plays by the rules. Just like there\u2019s nothing more American than ensuring that elected leaders are subject to the rule of law and held accountable when they violate our rights.\nAfter getting elected based on false promises, Trump is leeching wealth from the middle class.

These practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity,\" the executive order, \"Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,\" reads.\nTrump also signed an executive order in February that prohibits schools and colleges that receive federal funds and are subject to Title IX from allowing men ontowomen's sports teamsand into women's locker rooms, and another in January expanding school choice.\nPresident Donald Trump, left, shakes hands with former President Joe Biden at Trump's inauguration in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Jan. 20, 2025 in Washington, D.C.(Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images)\nAnother top campaign issue was theeconomy and job creationamid spiraling inflation under the Biden administration.\nSTEVE MOORE: IF TRUMP MAKES THESE DEALS IT WILL BE \u2018VERY POSITIVE\u2019 FOR THE ECONOMY\n\"The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency.\u00a0We will drill, baby, drill,\" Trump said during his inaugural address.\nHe added that \"America will be a manufacturing nation once again,\" and that the administration \"will bring prices down\" with the aid of unleashing American energy, such as oil and coal.\nInflation has eased since 2024, with the March annual inflation rate falling to 2.4% from 2.8% in February, according to theU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics(BLS). The annual inflation rate in March 2024 stood at 3.5%.\nThe U.S. job market added 151,000 jobs in February, and 228,000 jobs in March, while the unemployment rate sits at 4.2% as of last month, according to BLS data. The unemployment rate sat at 3.9% in March 2024 under the Biden administration.\n\"The prices are going down, not going up. One of the big things is, energy is going down. I see that we had a couple of states where gasoline was at $1.98 a gallon.

It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources,\" he added.\nOn April 2, Trump announced his administration's reciprocal, customized tariff plan to be imposed on dozens of nations as part of his highly-anticipated Liberation Day event. The plan aims to bring parity to the country's chronic trade deficit.\nTRUMP SAYS CHINA'S XI CALLED HIM AMID ONGOING CONFUSION OVER TRADE TALKS\nOn April 9, when the tariff plan took effect, Trump abruptly changed course and put the reciprocal tariff plan on ice for 90 days. China, however, was not spared from the pause and was instead hit with a 125% after the Asian nation retaliated against the U.S. with its own tariffs.\nA tariff negotiation blitz is now underway as nations across the world look to book meetings with the White House to iron out more favorable terms. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent lauded South Korea specifically last week for its negotiations, saying talks have progressed quickly and that the two countries could reach a trade agreement as early as this week.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, left, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, right, are key economic advisors to President Donald Trump's trade negotiations.(Getty Images)\n\"We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today,\" Bessent said from the White House on Thursday. \"We may be moving faster than I thought, and we will be talking technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week.\"\n\"So South Koreans came early. They came with their A game, and we will see if they follow through on that,\" Bessent continued.\nConcerns have mounted that the tariffs will cause American consumers to spend more at the checkout lines.

You know, in the old days, about 1870 to 1913, the tariffs were the only form of money. And that's when our nation was relatively the richest.

Altogether, Trump has signed over 140 executive orders during his first 100 days in office during his second term. That is an increase from the 33 he signed during the first 100 days of his first term, and up from the previous record of 99 that former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed during that same timeframe.\nThe Trump administration\u2019smass deportation effort is in full force, and border czar Tom Homan told reporters Monday that border crossings were down by 96% under the Trump administration.\nWHITE HOUSE TOUTS 100-DAY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN AFTER BIDEN \u2018UNSECURED THE BORDER ON PURPOSE\u2019\nPress secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks alongside \"border czar\" Tom Homan during the daily briefing at the White House on April 28, 2025.(Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images)\nAdditionally, the White House said earlier in April it has deported more than 100,000 illegal immigrants in 2025. The administration\u2019s handling of these deportations has attracted scrutiny in certain high-profile cases, including one involving El Salvador native Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the Trump administration claimed in court filings was deported by mistake.\nHowever, the Trump administration has since said Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang and has released protective order documents from his wife.\nFollowing through on another campaign promise, the Trump administration unveiled sweeping tariffs against a host of countries on April 2, after historically lambasting other countries' trade practices and accusing them of engaging in unfair trade practices against the U.S.\n\"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,\" Trump said April 2 at the White House.\nThe administration later walked back its initial proposal, and announced April 9 it would immediately hike tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% but scale back reciprocal tariffs on other countries for 90 days to a baseline of 10%. In response, China proceeded to boost its tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%.\nAdditionally, Trump signed an executive order on March 20 to overhaul the Education Department \u2014 following through on a campaign promise he made to eliminate the federal government\u2019s influence over education and \"stop the abuse of your taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America\u2019s youth.\"\nTRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER SURGE: THE UNPRECEDENTED USE OF PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive order to reduce the size and scope of the Education Department alongside school children signing their own versions, during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on March 20, 2025.(Getty)\nA White House fact sheet on the executive order said the directive aims to \"turn over education to families instead of bureaucracies\" and instructs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\"\nStill, Trump revealed that functions of the department overseeing Pell Grants, student loans and others that provide services for those with special needs would continue at other agencies.\nLikewise, Trump has long called for an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and promised to end the conflict between the two within 24 hours during his time on the campaign trail.\nTRUMP REPORTS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ENCOUNTERS AT HISTORIC LOWS DURING FIRST FULL MONTH IN OFFICE\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sparred during Zelenskyy's visit to the White House in February, but have since picked up peace discussions to end the conflict with Russia.(Getty)\nStill, he has continued to advance negotiations during his first 100 days in office \u2014 including hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the White House in February.

The liberal media, which has underestimated and misrepresented this president for the past decade, would have us believe that his second term so far has been a disaster. Many of us who voted for Trump disagree.\nPollsters tell us that Trump\u2019s approval ratings are in free fall. Critics (and the president) suggest some polls don\u2019t pass the smell test. GOP pollster John McLaughlin reports that in the new NY Times/Siena poll, which showed Trump with a meager 42% approving of how the president is handling his job, only 37% of the survey group voted for Trump in 2024.\nThe recent ABC/Washington Post poll showed Trump at 39% approval \u2013 \"The Lowest in 80 Years\" blared a headline \u2013 but included, according to McLaughlin, only 34% Trump voters. As McLaughlin asked pointedly on Truth Social, \"Didn\u2019t we win popular vote with 50%?\"\nSEC. BESSENT SAYS TRADE DEALS ARE 'MOVING VERY QUICKLY': PARTNERS BROUGHT 'THEIR A GAME'\nA firm called Quantus Insights, that claims to have achieved better accuracy than most polling outfits in 2024, shows in a recent survey that Trump still commands 91% backing from Republicans and that his overall approval is still about 48%, higher than most other surveys.\nCoal miner Jeff Crowe winks at President Donald Trump after he signed Crowe's speech during an event on energy production in the East Room of the White House, April 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\nStill, Trump\u2019s support has undeniably softened, and no wonder. Economists tell us that prices are set to soar, the U.S. is likely to tumble into recession, a \"supply shock is coming\" and thatthe dollar is under attack.\nNever mind that inflation has eased over the past two months and actually turned negative in March. \u00a0Never mind that the jobs market remains solid and that Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently told Bret Baier on Fox News that \"consumers are still spending.\"\nThe end is near, we are told, all because Trump is attempting something that should have happened a decade or two ago: he is trying to make America competitive again. He is trying to undo the damage done by allowing China to join the World Trade Organization, looking the other way while China broke everyrule meant to promote fair trade(Thank you Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama.) and by a series of trade agreements that allowed U.S. companies to ship jobs overseas.\nThe liberal media\u2019s take on Trump\u2019s tariff battle is relentlessly and universally negative. Isn\u2019t there anyone who worries that the U.S. is dependent on Chinese industry and pharmaceuticals? Isn\u2019t anyone irate that America\u2019s EU allies put 10% tariffs on U.S. autos while we impose only a 2.5% tariff on BMWs and Volvos? Does anyone see any upside at all to the Trump trade agenda?\nWhy yes, it turns out that possibly a great many people agree with the president\u2019s actions. Pollster Frank Luntz convened a group of some 15 Trump voters recently, taking their pulse on the rocky past few weeks and expecting them to blast their elected leader, especially on tariffs and the stock market downturn.\nLuntz seemed surprised to find out that the Trump voters remained solidly in the president\u2019s camp. On predicted tariff-generated price hikes, they said they were willing to pay more for goods made in the U.S. and supported trying to bring home production. On the stock market, they observed that markets go up and down, and that there had been corrections even under President Joe Biden.\nOverall, the group appeared willing to give Trump time to work through his agenda, noting that it was only a few months into his term, and that he had three and a half years to go.\nThat is certainly not the view of the liberal press, which has fought Trump every step of his political journey. Whether it was pushing our NATO allies to up their defense spending or calling out China for breaking trade rules and stealing our intellectual property, or advocating for a border wall, the establishment fought him until voters took his side.\nThe end is near, we are told, all because Trump is attempting something that should have happened a decade or two ago: he is trying to make America competitive again.\nTrump does not have much time. Since he can serve for only four years, and since he might lose the GOP majority in Congress in less than two years, he entered the Oval Office moving at what is now called Trump Speed on a host of initiatives. He is giving Democrats heartburn by tackling so many ambitions at once.\nOf 31 main campaign promises, even The Washington Post has had to acknowledge that he has made progress on all but eight, and that summary is dishonest. Of the eight described as \"Hasn\u2019t Happened,\" the promise to \"cut taxes\" and \"eliminate taxes on tips and overtime\" is clearly \"underway\" (another category) as Congress works toward a reconciliation bill.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThe Post points out that numerous initiatives face \"roadblocks,\" with judges stepping in to deny progress on ending birthright citizenship and cutting funds to sanctuary cities; some of these proposals will succeed, others will not. Trump supporters will cut him some slack for not being able to overcome judicial interference.\nBut they will also applaud those promises that Trump is quickly moving to fulfill: expanding oil and gas production, rolling back destructive environmental regulations, eliminating offensive race and gender curriculms in schools, preventing girls from having to compete in sports with biological males and drastically reducing the flow of people entering our country illegally.\nThese policies offend the liberal establishment, but that isn\u2019t the group that elected Trump. Working-class, common-sense Americans voted for Donald Trump and for the most part I\u2019m guessing that \u2013 like the Luntz sample \u2013 they like what he is doing.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFor sure, because the president has taken on such a boatload of initiatives, mistakes have been made. The roll-out of the tariff program, in particular, was choppy and has created uncertainty. But if the White House can ink deals with India, Japan and South Korea in the next month or so, those wins will calm markets and cheer voters.\nTrump should continue to deliver on his campaign promises. \u00a0The polling will take care of itself\u2026 and become great again.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE LIZ PEEK", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/liz-peek-ignore-biased-polls-trump-voters-love-his-first-100-days"}

Now, he needs to make time to hear the concerns of small businesses. FILE: Afternoon sunlight shines on the historic core of downtown Independence.(iStock)\nSmall business is big businessfor America, which is why it is often referred to as the backbone of the U.S. economy. Per Small Business Administration statistics, there are nearly 35 million small businesses, compared to less than 20,000 big businesses. Small businesses account for around half of the private economy and create the majority of new jobs.\nHowever, as small businesses are spread out across geographies, demographics, industries and sizes, they don\u2019t garner as much attention in Washington. There are fantastic individual advocates as well as advocacy organizations like NFIB (National Federation of Independent Business), the S Corporation Association, the NSBA (National Small Business Association), the SBE Council (Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council) and many industry-specific organizations, among others, that should receive as many invitations to economic discussions as the bigger players.\nSmall businesses have been shouldering the fallout of government mandates for half a decade. First, state and local COVID-19 mandates shut down and negatively impacted millions of small businesses, for which the poorly designed PPP program did not fully compensate.\nOn the back of the COVID mandates, long-term disruptions occurred to supply chains and labor markets which further hurt small businesses. Then, historic inflation under the Biden administration put even more pressure on small businesses and their customers.\nWhile small companies were optimistic for theMain Street-first Trump administration,expecting deregulation and tax certainty to help boost their business growth, millions of small businesses are instead fighting yet another government-imposed battle with tariffs.\nWhether a small business has part or all of their supply chain abroad, has domestic suppliers with exposure to foreign supply chains or customers cutting back on spending and investment due to market and economic uncertainty, they are being hurt financially.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAnd while big companies like Apple were granted a temporary clawback in their tariff exposure, decreasing China-sourced tariffs for smartphones, computers and chips from 145% to 20%, millions of small businesses did not receive any relief. Apple has tens of billions of dollars in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet; small businesses do not have such balance sheet leverage.\nWhile understanding the needs of companies like Apple and Walmart is important, it is just as important to understand the needs of small companies throughout the country.\nSmall businesses have been shouldering the fallout of government mandates for half a decade.

They want to exist on the same playing field as everyone else and not have government-imposed barriers, regulations and challenges put in their path at every turn.\nTo understand these challenges, President Trump should invite more small businesses and their advocates to the White House.

Many frontline leaders\u00a0foresaw its failure, but we could not have imagined the full scale of devastation it would unleash.\nWHY BLUE STATE POLICIES ARE CAUSING EVEN MORE HOMELESSNESS IN AMERICA\nHomelessness has eruptedinto a\u00a0full-blown catastrophe,\u00a0reaching its highest point in recorded history, with bodies sprawled throughout America\u2019s streets, lives lost daily and communities unraveling.\nFar from fostering stability, Housing First has institutionalized dependency \u2013 at the individual level, within the nonprofit sector and among local policymakers.\nThose struggling with homelessness face three primary deficits that keep them stuck:\nDeficit of Income:While seemingly obvious, homeless individuals often lack the capability to earn enough to meet their basic needs. Without intervention, they remain in a cycle of poverty. We must help the homeless grow their earnings through job training and financial literacy programs, enabling them to live within their means.\nHomeless people in San Diego, California, on Jan. 8, 2025.(Derek Shook for Fox News Digital)\nHOMELESS PEOPLE NEED MORE THAN A HOUSE. THEY NEED SOMETHING MONEY CAN'T BUY\nDeficit of Support:If you or I were to become homeless tomorrow, we would have family and friends to lean on\u00a0for\u00a0a hand-up. Not so\u00a0for\u00a0most people on the streets. They often have no support network. We must help them repair or rebuild their support systems \u2013 offering ongoing encouragement and guidance \u2013 so they are not left to struggle alone.\nDeficit of Purpose:Human beings are designed\u00a0for\u00a0purpose. Those experiencing homelessness may have lost their way, but they have not lost the intrinsic purpose\u00a0for\u00a0which they were designed. We must help them rediscover their value to reignite their sense of self-worth.\nToo often, it is suggested thataffordable housingis the silver bullet. It is not.\nHousing alone does nothing to address the income, support and purpose deficits that accompany homelessness.\nHomelessness is a health and human services emergency \u2013 deeply linked to mental health, substance abuse and individual well-being.\nHomeless migrants wait in line to receive food and clothing donations in Tompkins Square Park on Jan. 20, 2024 in New York City.(Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)\nI\u2019M A BLUE STATE MAYOR AND THE FUTURE OF HOMELESSNESS SCARES ME\nHuman First programs like the one I led\u00a0for\u00a013 years \u2013 Northern California\u2019s largest program\u00a0for\u00a0homeless women and children \u2013 prove that addressing these issues and others that often accompany homelessness yields lasting results.\nBy integrating treatment,job training, life-skills and accountability with temporary housing, thousands of\u00a0formerly addicted single mothers achieved sobriety, secured employment and some even became California homeowners.\nOur $19,000 annual cost per person was a fraction of the short-term expense, and a substantial reduction in the long-term public burden that creates massive strain on public systems.\nHomeless individuals with untreated addiction and mental illness cost taxpayers between $30,000 and $50,000 annually in emergency services, health care and law enforcement expenses.\nTo reverse this crisis, we must dismantle the disastrous federal mandates that have shackled the homeless, local communities and innovation.\nTHESE CITIES' FEIGNED COMPASSION MAKING DRUG AND HOMELESSNESS CRISES WORSE\nHousing Secretary Scott Turner\u2019s bold proposal to slash HUD\u2019s bureaucracy and redirect its focus is a vital step. Massive cuts to the agency\u2019s inefficiency and rigidity will empower local governments with the flexibility to create tailored, results-driven solutions.\nEqually promising is the idea of block-granting homelessness funds directly to states \u2013 or better yet, counties. Counties, as frontline providers ofhealth and human services, are best positioned to deliver precise, accountable care. Unlike states, counties have granular, real-time insights into their communities\u2019 needs and can implement nimble, localized solutions.\nMoreover, routing funds through counties rather than states ensures that every dollar stretches further as each layer of bureaucracy siphons off resources. By directing funding to the county level, we reduce administrative waste and ensure resources swiftly reach those in need.\nHowever, these reforms, alone, will not reverse the nation\u2019s crisis.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nFor\u00a011 years, state and county officials have been under HUD\u2019s thumb,\u00a0forced to implement Housing First as homelessness,overdose deathsand public disorder surged in their communities, constrained in challenging it\u00a0for\u00a0fear of losing funding.\nSecretary Turner must also consider how to equip local leaders who are lost when it comes to ways to quickly and effectively reverse their metastasizing crisis.\nHomelessness is far more than a moral dilemma.

Trump\u00a0thinks Powell\u00a0has just one job, which is to do whatever\u00a0Trump\u00a0tells him to do. But that\u2019s wrong. TheFederal Reserveis created by Congress. Powell\u00a0is supposed to do what Congress tells him to do.\u00a0And right there in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 225a Congress has ordered the Fed to promote\u00a0\"maximum employment, stable prices,\u00a0and moderate long-term interest rates.\"\nThat seems clear enough until you turn to Section 10, where Congress tells the president he has the duty to appoint the chair of the Fed. Trump\u00a0claims that this must mean he also has the power to fire the chair.\nIf this was a simple power struggle, it wouldn\u2019t matter all that much. But Trump\u00a0alsostarted\u00a0an\u00a0economic\u00a0fightin January when, in his inauguration speech, he promised to \"overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers\u00a0and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries,\u00a0we\u00a0will tariff\u00a0and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\"\nAMERICA CAN RETURN TO FISCAL SANITY WITH STRONG FEDERAL RESERVE LEADERSHIP AND TRUMP BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE\nSo far Trump\u00a0has been inconsistent in honoring that promise. On April 2 he\u00a0announced his massive \"liberation day\" tariffs. On April 9, he suspended the tariffs. He said China was a big problem that required the U.S. to imposemassive new tariffs. Then he suspended those tariffs on electronic goods.\nYou might think that if the president is talking\u00a0and not doing, things can\u2019t go too badly. Maybe his advisors are keeping him from doing\u00a0any real harm.\nIf only.\nIn fact, the uncertainty is almost worse. Businesses can\u2019t brace themselves for one threat, they must worry about them all.\nTRUMP CRANKS UP HEAT ON FED CHAIR WHILE PRESSING FOR RATE CUT: 'POWELL\u2019S TERMINATION CANNOT COME FAST ENOUGH!'\nPowell\u00a0is in\u00a0an\u00a0even tougher spot. His mandate \u2013low inflationand low unemployment \u2013 are tough enough without a president who thinks he can \"overhaul our trade system.\" It\u2019s nearly impossible with a president who keeps changing his mind about how to do it.\nThis whole thing is especially\u00a0annoying to\u00a0economists.\u00a0We\u00a0can see the damage already being done when\u00a0we\u00a0look at the bad stuff happening in\u00a0bond\u00a0and currency markets.\u00a0And\u00a0we\u00a0know there\u2019s\u00a0an\u00a0easy solution: put a computer in charge of the Fed.\nSeriously. Fire\u00a0Powell, tell\u00a0Trump\u00a0he\u2019s got\u00a0an\u00a0early tee time\u00a0and then program a few simple rules into a computer. Let the machine set interest rates\u00a0and control the money supply.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nFor at least the past 40 years,smart economistshave been debating \"rules versus discretion.\" The question is whether the work of the Fed \u2013 influencing interest rates\u00a0and so forth \u2013 should be done by smart people who adjust to circumstances or\u00a0well-trained clerks who make sure the rules programmed into a computer are followed.

{"title": "Congress can stop California's radical environmental mandates that hurt the entire nation", "date": "2025-04-23", "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has launched an inspiring effort to regain sanity in our nation\u2019s energy policies. One of his initiatives is particularly important \u2014 reversing the Biden administration\u2019s attempt to superchargeCalifornia\u2019s electric-vehicle mandates,which would allow that state to push a radical transformation of our nation\u2019s fleet from gas-powered to electric. Congress has an opportunity for a policy and constitutional win here. The reversal of Biden and California\u2019s undemocratic effort is now on the five-yard line. To score, Congress needs to punch through one more bureaucratic agency.\nOver the last several years, California has tried to aggressively export itsprogressive energy ideology,leading to a wide number of short-sighted and unconstitutional policies. Near the top of the list are California\u2019s bureaucratically crafted electric-vehicle mandates, some of which seek to transform the nation\u2019s heavy-duty fleet from diesel-based to electric.\nCalifornia\u2019s attempt to drive national policy would normally run into both constitutional (interstate commerce clause) and statutory (Clean Air Act) roadblocks. Unfortunately, the Biden Environmental Protection Agency attempted to bless California\u2019s overreach by granting so-called Clean Air Act \"preemption waivers\" tothree electric-vehicle mandatespassed by unelected California bureaucrats.\nTRUMP ADMIN TOUTS ENERGY COMEBACK\nThese waivers give California a Sword of Damocles to hang over the industry. Nebraska has fought back, leading a three-part battle by filing lawsuits against California, the Biden-era mandates and the trucking companies that agreed to eliminate consumer choice in the trucking market.\nEPA chief Lee Zeldin is already going after California's energy waivers. It's a good start.(Getty Images)\nThe good news is that the Trump administration is pushing common-sense energy policies, and Zeldin has taken the first necessary step to repeal the waivers. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can repeal EPA\u2019s waivers by passing a resolution of disapproval through simple majorities in the House and Senate plus the president\u2019s signature.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s promise to unleash American energy by rescinding radical electric-vehicle mandates \u2014 combined with Republican majorities in both houses of Congress \u2014 make a legislative repeal a no-brainer. Nebraskans are grateful that our two United States Senators, Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts, are helping to lead the charge for energy policy sanity.\nNow there\u2019s a roadblock. A nonbinding opinion from the Government Accountability Office judged that the California waivers are not \"rules\" of \"general applicability\" subject to review under the Congressional Review Act. That opinion is wrong.\nThe California waivers are \"rules\" because they enact forward-looking policy decisions. And the waivers are \"generally applicable\" because they reach well beyond California\u2019s borders. Even if one ignores the obvious nationwide (if not worldwide) implications of mandating electric vehicles in the fifth-largest economy in the world, the California waivers are generally applicable because they allow other states to enact electric-vehicle mandates they otherwise could not.\nUnder the Clean Air Act, only Congress can set emission standards for new motor vehicles. The sole exception is California, which can seek a waiver from EPA to enforce emission standards more stringent than the federal ones. But once California gets a waiver, any of the other 49 states can \"adopt and enforce\" emission standards \"identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted\" without asking EPA for permission.\nSo far, 18 states have adopted at least one of California\u2019s electric-vehicle mandates. The Biden-era waiver paves the way for a widespread adoption of California\u2019s bans on internal-combustion engines. This is precisely the kind of agency action that falls within the purview of the Congressional Review Act.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nFinding that the waivers are subject to the CRA is both a lawful and commonsense exercise of congressional authority. The GAO \u2014 headed by an Obama appointee \u2014 broke its own precedent in issuing nonbinding \"observations\" on whether the California waivers are subject to the CRA. Never before had the GAO opined on an agency action that an agency already submitted for CRA review.\nThe GAO itself has said that, once an agency action has been submitted to Congress for CRA review, there are \"no impediments to Congress\u2019s exercise of those powers that could be cured by an opinion from GAO.\" Procedural irregularities aside, the GAO\u2019s opinion is substantively flawed. It fails to mention that once California gets a waiver, every other state can adopt emission standards identical to the California standards, giving the waivers nationwide effect.\nThe California waivers are \"rules\" because they enact forward-looking policy decisions. And the waivers are \"generally applicable\" because they reach well beyond California\u2019s borders.\nAccepting the GAO\u2019s novel observations here would effectively give unelected bureaucrats the final say on whether elected lawmakers get to review sweeping regulatory decisions \u2014 decisions that impact the national economy, consumer choice and federalism itself. If Congress defers here, it risks outsourcing democratic oversight of major national policy to technical advisors. That would weaken our constitutional protections.\nThe Republican Party has claimed unified control of the federal government only five times in the past 100 years. Using that control to repeal California\u2019s waivers is both a policy and constitutional win. Elected representatives in Congress, not unelected bureaucrats in Sacramento or a so-called \"independent\" agency like GAO, have the power to regulate the means of interstate commerce.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDeferring to the GAO would be an undemocratic trifecta \u2014 it would leave in place rules written by unelected state regulators, approved by unelected federal bureaucrats and shielded from democratic review through unelected, self-declared referees. That\u2019s not how a representative government is supposed to work.\nRepealing the waivers would do more than block a radical climate agenda \u2014 it would restore a basic principle of American self-government: that laws with national scope must be subject to national debate, national scrutiny, and national consent. Congress has the authority to act, and I urge it to use that authority and repeal these short-sighted waivers.\nMike Hilgers is Nebraska's 33rd attorney general.

All they can do is take your taxpayer money and use it to give public employees benefits and job security many regular workers will never see.\nPresident Donald Trump just signed an executive order banning the kind of collective bargaining private unions do for most public employee unions. In doing so, he\u2019s aligned with none other than Democratic Party hero and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who famously wrote to a public employee union president in 1937 expressing the danger of such practices used against the employer when \"the employer is the whole people.\"\nThe Trump administration has also ordered public unions to report how much time they spend on union activities on the job, just as it did in his first administration.\nPresident Joe Biden shut down that data collection during his tenure, but the Washington Examiner\u00a0\"managed to get data from 2019\u2026 and according to a report by OPM, government union employees spent a total of 2,606,390 hours that year performing union tasks on government time at a cost of $163,327,235.\"\u00a0As DOGE and a Republican administration audit more agencies, they\u2019ll find more.\nThat\u2019s right, these unions use the majority of the money they bring in (your money!) to pay for political activism, funding candidates and causes to the tune of hundreds of millions and even billions, and they do it\u00a0on the clock.

Misdirection is the art of drawing your opponent\u2019s attention one way, while the real play is happening elsewhere. It\u2019s how a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat. It's how\u00a0Trump\u00a0has always played politics \u2013 and he's back on center stage.\n10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER\nHere are three ways\u00a0Trump\u00a0is\u00a0using magician misdirection right now:\n1. Tariff Hype, But The Real Tariffs Were Aimed At China\nEveryone\u2019s shouting\u00a0about\u00a0Trump\u2019s 10% tariff on all countries \u2013 calling it reckless, inflationary and a new trade war in disguise. But while the mainstream media fixates on the headlines,\u00a0Trump\u2019s real play is something else entirely: Sending awarning message to Chinaand reviving good old American manufacturing.\nConsider\u00a0Trump's tactics.\u00a0Announce a policy.\u00a0Change a policy.\u00a0Announce a policy. Change a policy.\nPart of being a master negotiator is to never let your opponent get balanced footing. In the end of this massive flurry of tariff talks the\u00a0last two weeks, the real tariff hit China the hardest at 145%, sending the ultimate message that we won\u2019t tolerate manipulative tactics from China.\nHERE'S WHAT TRUMP IS REALLY UP TO WITH HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBIT\nWhile behind closed doors, the\u00a0Trump\u00a0team is simultaneously working with economic advisors to roll out a broader industrial plan \u2013 one focused on bringing critical supply chains home, incentivizing American-made goods and loosening our dangerous reliance on China. The tariff talk? That\u2019s just the spark. The fire iseconomic independence.\n2. Tariff Revenue, Tax Talks\nAmid all the tariff scuttlebutt, most Americans are forgetting that right around the corner looms one of thelargest tax discussionsin American history. President\u00a0Trump\u00a0signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, and those very tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025.\nOne of the big initial questions is, how we are going to pay for the tax cuts to continue and for\u00a0what\u00a0was promised on the campaign, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits.\nAccording to a study,\u00a0President\u00a0Trump\u2019s tariff plan\u00a0(as of April 8, 2025) is projected to raise significant revenue \u2013 over $5.2 trillion over 10 years on a \"strict conventional\" basis and $4.2 trillion on a \"partially dynamic\" basis commonly\u00a0used with\u00a0tariffs. This revenue\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0used to reduce federal debt, thereby encouraging private investment.\nHOW THE SENATE AND HOUSE FIND $2 TRILLION\nInstead, while most of the public-facing discussion in the media has been\u00a0abouttrade imbalancesor resurrecting fairness of trade around the world so the United States doesn\u2019t get taken advantage of anymore, this is a master magician move by\u00a0President\u00a0Trump\u00a0as I predict he will\u00a0use these tariffs revenues as a bargaining chip for a new tax plan that will move corporate tax rates to 15%, fulfill part of the \"no tax\" promises made on the campaign trail, and create tax cuts for millions of middle-class families in America.\u00a0It\u2019s just that nobody is talking\u00a0about\u00a0it right now.\n3. It\u2019s\u00a0Not\u00a0A Nobel Prize, It\u2019s The Noble Cause\nFrom Ukraine toGaza, and with growing tensions between Taiwan and China, global instability is on the rise. Some suggest that Trump\u2019s goal in stopping these wars is selfishly to win a Nobel Peace Prize.\nBut while\u00a0President\u00a0Joe Biden tried to walk a tightrope, hoping to please both progressives and defense hawks,\u00a0Trump\u00a0is pushing a simple message:\u00a0peace through energy, economic strength, and keeping our enemies off balance.\u00a0If you don\u2019t comply, \"there will be hell to pay.\"\nWe don\u2019t always know\u00a0what\u00a0President\u00a0Trump\u2019s real goal is in this magic trick.

And the shift back to the policy that was prior to the 2017 tax cuts would be a dramatic tax increase for many.\"\nBut technically, Republicans aren\u2019t cutting taxes.\n\"As simple as I can make this bill. It is about keeping tax rates the same,\" said Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, on Fox.\nCongress had to write the 2017 tax reduction bill in a way so that the reductions would expire this year. That was for accounting purposes. Congress didn\u2019t have to count the tax cuts against the deficit thanks to some tricky number-crunching mechanisms \u2013 so long as they expired within a multi-year window. But the consequence was that taxes could climb if lawmakers failed to renew the old reductions.\n\"It sunsets and so you just automatically go back to the tax levels prior to 2017,\" said Sen.

Republicans are no longer the party of the \"wealthy.\" Manual laborers, shop and storekeepers and small business persons now comprise Trump\u2019s GOP.

Pritzker, D-Ill., gives his take on President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff strategy and more on \u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019\nA month before the 2024 election,Elon Musk tweeted, \"Trump now leading Kamala by 3% in betting markets. More accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line.\"\nThese markets were correct. Also correct is Musk\u2019s assessment of these markets. When people stake their own money, they do so with as much solid information and rational foresight as possible.\nThis fact is a big reason why PresidentDonald Trumpshould reverse his tariff policy. Financial markets are driven by people investing their own money in anticipation of future economic conditions, and these markets are screaming that the president\u2019s tariffs will inflict enormous harm on America\u2019s economy.\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 10, 2025, a day after announcing a 90-day pause on \"reciprocal\" tariffs, with the exception of China.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\nFrom the time of Trump\u2019s April 2 release of his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs until his April 9\u00a0announcement of a 90-day pause in most of these duties, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 11% of its value. The S&P 500 dropped by 12% and the NASDAQ by 13%. These massive declines occurred in a mere six days. Then when investors learned of his tariff pause, the sell-off stopped. Much, though not all, of these losses were recovered.\n10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER\nIf the tariffs were truly likely to restructureAmerica\u2019s economyin a way that, as Trump promises, will \"make us very rich and very strong,\" the tariff announcement would have immediately had Wall Street overrun with bulls. They would have ignored any short-term economic disruptions caused by the tariffs. Focused on the bright future, the bulls would have immediately driven share prices upward.\nBut instead, financial markets tanked as they were mauled by bears \u2013 revealing that people in the know and spending their own money anticipated that the economic damage from these tariffs won\u2019t be temporary. It will be lasting.\nThen the bulls appeared in force as soon as the president announced his 90-day pause. There\u2019s no better evidence that investors with their eyes on the future are convinced that these tariffs are economically destructive.\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t they be destructive?\nRIGHT STARTS TO SOUND LIKE THE LEFT ON TARIFFS: THAT'S NOT AMERICA FIRST\nBy raising the prices of consumer goods, tariffs shrink families\u2019 purchasing power.\nBy protecting producers from competition,businesses becomeless entrepreneurial and innovative. The economy\u2019s dynamism diminishes.\nFurther, because\u00a0more than 61%\u00a0of U.S. imports are raw materials and intermediate goods used as inputs by producers in America, tariffs jack up American firms\u2019 costs of production. Covering these higher costs by raising the prices of their outputs, these firms not only sell less at home, their exports become less competitive globally. As firms sell and export less, they lay off workers.\nAnd several foreign governments retaliate by raising their own tariffs. This retaliation further reduces the market for U.S. exports.\nUnfortunately, the tariffs\u2019 economic carnage doesn\u2019t end there. By dampening the American economy\u2019s competitiveness and dynamism, tariffs incite global investors to retreat from the U.S.\nI OWN A CORVETTE DEALERSHIP AND I\u2019VE ALREADY SEEN THE BENEFIT OF TRUMP\u2019S TARIFFS\nGlobal investment brings capital to our shores and lowers our interest rates. Much of this capital funds the opening of new businesses, the expansion and improvement of existing businesses, and research and development as well as worker training.\nThese investments raise U.S. GDP. More importantly, they increase American workers\u2019 productivity. And increased worker productivity is utterly necessary if real wages are to rise and Americans\u2019 living standards to continue to improve.\nAnd so as the tariffs prod global investors to flee the U.S., American workers will, over time, find themselves less well-trained, and employed in workplaces that are less productive. Americans\u2019 incomes will shrink.\nThis retreat of global investors from America will, ironically, achieve one of Trump\u2019s main goals: smallerU.S. trade deficits. The president believes that these deficits are evidence that other countries are cheating America and\u00a0ripping us off.\nNETWORKS GO FULL NEGATIVE SPIN OVER TARIFF TURBULENCE, STEER CLEAR OF GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS\nBut the president is mistaken. America runs trade deficits because foreigners are especially eager to invest in America. Just as you can\u2019t spend all of your dollars onconsumption goodsif you want to invest, foreigners can\u2019t spend all of their dollars on American exports if they want to invest in America.\nDollars that foreigners don\u2019t spend on American exports raise U.S. trade deficits. But those same dollars are invested in America, causing the U.S. to run capital-accountsurpluses\u2013 meaning, a net inflow of investment to our shores.\nBecause no one invests in places believed to be in economic decline, the now half-century-long run of U.S. trade deficits proves that investors worldwide have immense confidence in America\u2019s economy. We shouldn\u2019t be pestered by having built a globally attractive economy. We should be proud.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAnd just as a company grows by attracting more investment, so does America\u2019s economy grow by attracting more investment.\nFar from U.S. trade deficits signaling Americans being ripped off, theseinvestment inflowsare foreigners\u2019 contributions to the health and growth of America\u2019s economy.

{"title": "New study about IRS reveals just how much Trump tax cuts saved you", "date": "2025-04-17", "body": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses Republican efforts on Capitol Hill to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s tax policy and more on \u2018Special Report.\u2019\nIn Washington, facts are often the first casualty of politics. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the debate over the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s signature tax reform law from his first term in office. As debates rage whether to extend the TCJA\u2019s individual tax cuts, left-wing politicians and legacy media outlets are ramping up their usual misinformation campaign.\nWe\u2019ve all heard the talking points: The TCJA was a\u00a0\"wealth transfer\" that came \"at the expense of working families,\"\u00a0a\u00a0\"giveaway to billionaires,\"\u00a0or my personal favorite, a\u00a0\"reverse Robin Hood\"\u00a0scheme to rob the working class for the benefit of the ultra-wealthy.\nThere\u2019s just one problem: none of that is true. Not even close.\nTAX TIPS: LAST-MINUTE ADVICE FROM EXPERTS AS TAX DAY NEARS\nEarlier in April, I co-authored a new policy study for The Heartland Institute examining the latest IRS personal income tax data. Our goal was to determine if the Republican tax law is still saving taxpayers money, and if so, how much?\nTrump can point to the success of his tax-cut strategy in aiding the middle class, according to a new study.\nWhat we found is that lower- and middle-income Americans have received the largest tax breaks due to the TCJA \u2014 and these are not small amounts, either. We estimate tens of millions of filers have saved thousands of dollars because of the Republicans\u2019 tax reform law, savings that are now at riskshould Congress fail to extendthe cuts before they expire at the end of 2025.\nThe evidence is clear, compelling and impossible to ignore \u2014 unless you\u2019re a partisan activist masquerading as a journalist.\nUsing government data, we were able to calculatehow much in taxesthe average filer in each IRS income bracket paid annually from 2017 to 2022. TCJA was passed into law in 2017 but didn\u2019t go into effect until 2018. By comparing the data from 2017 to later years, we can determine the effect of the tax cuts on individuals and families.\nThe IRS data shows that every income bracket received a tax cut because of the TCJA, but the taxpayers who received the biggest cuts, in terms of percentage saved, went to those who earned less than $75,000.\nFor example, the average filer in the IRS\u2019s \"$40,000 under $50,000\" bracket paid 18.8% less in taxes in 2022 than they did in 2017.\nSimilarly, the tax bill for filers in the \"$50,000 under $75,000\" bracket was 16.5% less in 2022 than it was in 2017.\nFor comparison, those earning between $5 million and $10 million paid 2.3% less over the same period. So much for the \"billionaire tax cut\" narrative. (You can find data for other income brackets in our published paper, which is availablehere.)\nSome critics of the TCJA have claimed that although middle-income Americans received large cuts to their tax rates, those tax rate reductions didn\u2019t amount to significant savings in terms of total dollars. But these assertions are also false. Many middle-class Americans have saved thousands because of the TCJA.\nA new analysis of IRS tax data indicates that everyone benefited from the Trump tax cuts, but those who earned less than $75,000 received a much-higher percentage of savings.(Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nOur analysis found from 2018 to 2022, filers earning between $50,000 and $75,000 annually saved an average of $4,516 because of the personal tax cuts contained in the TCJA. For those in the $75,000 to $100,000 bracket, the savings jumped to $5,923. And those earning $100,000 to $200,000 saved an astonishing $9,638 over five years.\nThese numbers do not tell the full story, however. Because the most recent IRS data available is from 2022, total savings estimates do not include the numbers from 2023 and 2024. To account for these years, we developed projected figures using the average amounts saved in 2018 to 2022.\nAfter extending the analysis through 2024 using consistent annual trends, the numbers become even more impressive. In 2022, more than 50 million middle-class filers fell into brackets that saved on average between $6,322 and $13,494 in total savings.\nEven lower-income and working-class Americans saw substantial relief. We estimate that households making between $30,000 and $50,000 saved $2,537 to $3,833 over the same period.\nIronically, the very law Democrats call a boon for the rich has made the U.S. tax code more progressive. We came to this conclusion by examining the tax burden paid by each IRS income bracket in 2017, the year before TCJA went into effect, compared to their burdens in subsequent years.\nWhat we found is that in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available, every income bracket earning less than $200,000 paid a smaller share of the total personal income tax burden than they did in 2017. Conversely, every bracket above $200,000 paid a greater share.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThat means that although every income group received a tax cut because of the TCJA,the Trump tax cutscaused wealthier filers to pay for a bigger chunk of the personal tax revenue pie than they did in previous years, the exact opposite of what Democrats frequently claim.\nIf Congress does nothing, the TCJA\u2019s personal income tax cuts will expire at the end of 2025. That means tens of millions of Americans will face a stealth tax hike. For many middle-income families, it could mean paying $900 or more in taxes annually.\nAfter extending the analysis through 2024 using consistent annual trends, the numbers become even more impressive.\nWashington elites might not feel it, but working families sure will.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThat\u2019s why this fight matters. This isn\u2019t about President Donald Trump or partisan point-scoring \u2014 it\u2019s about whether the government should take more from families already struggling under the weight of inflation and stagnant wages.\nThe data is in. The verdict is clear. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked \u2014 for everyone, but especially for working-class and middle-income Americans. It\u2019s time to tell the truth about the tax cuts, and then make them permanent.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINS\nJustin Haskins is a New York Times bestselling author and a senior fellow at The Heartland Institute and Our Republic.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/new-study-about-irs-reveals-just-how-much-trump-tax-cuts-saved-you"}

For one thing,\u00a0Biden actually increased\u00a0tariffs on Canadian lumber and received very little backlash from his own party.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that lumber prices alone have a relatively small impact on the cost of home construction (and shouldn\u2019t affect the price of existing homes at all).\nOne analysis by the\u00a0National Association of Homebuilders\u00a0(which advocates for low tariffs on construction materials) found that framing is the single most expensive part of building a new house, accounting for 15.5% of the final construction cost. But when you consider framing as a share of the home\u2019s sales price (which is what buyers actually care about) and try to separate out labor costs, lumber accounts for a much smaller percentage \u2014 perhaps as low as 4%. The current tariff on Canadian lumber is\u00a014.5%.\nCrunch those numbers, and it seems like wood tariffs drive up the cost of a median home by\u00a0a few hundred dollars\u00a0at most. That\u2019s not nothing, but it doesn\u2019t come close to explaining how home prices got so out of control.\nAnother Democratic line of attack, best exemplified by anexchangebetween JD Vance and podcast host Lulu Garcia-Navarro, has focused on immigration policy.\n\"So how do you propose to build all the housing necessary that we need in this country by removing all the people who are working in construction?,\" Garcia-Navarro asked the then-candidate for vice president.\n\"Well, I think it\u2019s a fair question because we know that back in the 1960s, when we had very low levels of illegal immigration, Americans didn\u2019t build houses,\" Vance answered, sarcastically.\nIt\u2019s true that non-citizens disproportionately work in construction (though not all construction workers build homes), but it\u2019s also true that they compete with citizens for scarce housing. Even the libertarian Cato Institute\u00a0acknowledges\u00a0that \"the marginal immigrant increases housing demand more than he increases housing supply.\" This means that, on the whole, less illegal immigration and more deportations will mean cheaper housing.\nDemocrats have tried to blame President Donald Trump for the spike in house prices. But President Joe Biden's administration was responsible. (Photo by TING SHEN/AFP via Getty Images)\nThough, of course, the entire issue is a red herring, since the massive wave of illegal immigration under President Joe Biden coincided with a spike in housing costs. Even if it were true that tight border controls and strict immigration enforcement would make homes\u00a0more\u00a0expensive, it wouldn\u2019t explain how they got so expensive in the first place.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nPerhaps most absurdly, Democrats and the Biden administration even tried to blame\u00a0landlords\u2019 greed and the pricing algorithms they use. The Biden\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0sued\u00a0one of these algorithms\u00a0to \"make housing more affordable for millions of people across the country,\" and Democrats in Congress have proposed similar legislation to end the use of this software.\u00a0This is ridiculous.\u00a0An empty apartment is a huge financial hit for a landlord. That is exactly what happens when they price their units too high \u2014\u00a0they are left holding them back.\nFortunately, while Democrats continue to scapegoat and point fingers, Republicans are aiming to fix the housing cost inflation problem with deregulation.\nThis means that, on the whole, less illegal immigration and more deportations will mean cheaper housing.\nFor example,\u00a0under\u00a0newly confirmed Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner, the Trump administration is working to cut red tape that many builders say has held back new construction.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nTurner has announced a comprehensive review of HUD\u2019s programs. Of course, much of the red tape is state or local, but there are plenty of federal barriers that can be deconstructed as well, and that is exactly what the Trump administration plans on doing.That\u2019s a step in the right direction, which is far more than what the Democrats are currently offering. Hopefully, it\u2019s the first of many similar initiatives to come. Housing is a great populist issue that can provide endless political wins for the White House\u00a0\u2014\u00a0so the more, the merrier.\nJohn Schuler is an economist and assistant professor in Computational and Data Sciences at George Mason University.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/house-prices-skyrocketed-under-biden-now-guess-who-democrats-want-blame"}

We\u2019ve spent 13 weeks in session, including the longest continuous period of session in 15 years, and the Senate has taken more votes at this point than in any other Congress since at least the Reagan era.\nWe have a lot to show for it.\u00a0We confirmed the president\u2019s Cabinet at the fastest pace in more than 20 years, despite Democratic obstruction, and we are building out the rest of PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s team at a brisk pace. As of this week, the Senate has confirmed more than 50 Trump nominees, including a new FBI director, a new chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and several ambassadors to key postings abroad.\nAnd confirmations are far\u00a0from\u00a0the only thing we\u2019ve done. We passed Sen. Katie Britt\u2019s, R-Ala., Laken Riley Act, which ensures that illegal immigrants who steal, assault a law enforcement officer, or kill or seriously injure another person are detained instead of being allowed back out on the street. And we passed Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Bill Cassidy\u2019s, R-La., HALT Fentanyl Act to provide law enforcement with critical tools to combat this deadly drug.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune and President Donald Trump(Reuters)\nWe\u2019ve also been working to repeal burdensome Biden-era regulations. The Senate has so far passed seven Congressional Review Act resolutions to roll back Biden rules.\u00a0Among other things, we\u2019ve repealed theBiden administration\u2019s tax on natural gas, taken action to protect Americans\u2019 financial freedom, and repealed burdensome mandates on household appliances that got caught up in the Biden administration\u2019s climate agenda.\n10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER\nImportantly, we\u2019ve also laid the groundwork for a permanent extension of the2017 tax reliefand a transformational investment in our border, energy and national security. I\u2019m proud of the role the Senate has played in advancing this process, and I\u2019m looking forward to finishing the final bill.\nI should also note that the list of our accomplishments would have been even longer if Democrats had not repeatedly filibustered commonsense legislation. Yes, the party that mere months ago was making plans to destroy the filibuster \u2013 a key Senate rule that today helps preserve the Founders\u2019 vision of the Senate \u2013 is now using it repeatedly.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nDemocrats have filibustered legislation to keep biological men out of women\u2019s sports, protect babies born alive after botched abortions, and sanction the rogue International Criminal Court, which is targeting Israeli\u00a0leaders today and has a history of targeting American citizens.\nWith as much as we\u2019ve already accomplished, there\u2019s a lot more work to be done, and we\u2019ll continue to keep our foot on the gas. There are appropriations bills to consider, more burdensome regulations to repeal, and work to be done to complete the final bill that will deliver on our promises on taxes,border security, strengthening our military, unleashing American energy, and getting our country on a more sustainable fiscal path.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThere are also more nominations to consider, and the Senate will continue to keep up a brisk pace. If Democrats decide to obstruct nominees, that isn\u2019t going to mean we slow down; it means we are going to keep senators here longer to get these confirmations done. If that means late nights or weekends, so be it. As I said to my Democrat colleagues, we can do these nominations the easy way or the hard way.\u00a0 But one way or another we are going to get them done.\nIt\u2019s been a busy 100 days in theUnited States Senate, and I\u2019m looking forward to delivering more results for the American people as Senate Republicans, House Republicans, and the White House continue to work together to advance our shared agenda.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

But\u00a0the\u00a0truth is that\u00a0these promises were always an inefficient way of helping\u00a0the\u00a0planet, and very shortsighted for fossil fuel companies.

Eventually, more people came around to the mistakes and promised this would not happen again.\nToday, embedded in the discourse around tariffs, we are seeing many of the same behaviors and language. But staggeringly, it is many on the right that are standing on the wrong side of freedom.\nThere are, no doubt, myriad fiscal issues plaguing the U.S. today.\nAN AMBITIOUS TRADE DEAL WITH INDIA IS IN OUR GRASP\nTheBiden administrationleft the Trump administration a giant fiscal mess. After Biden propped up growth with massive deficit spending, our U.S. debt/GDP grew to north of 120%. Our deficit/GDP in the 6-7% range is now that of a country at war. Our spending on interest to service our debt exceeds U.S. defense spending, which is a massive warning sign. Biden\u2019s historic inflation remains difficult to combat.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s options are limited given all the above, current interest rates, massive financing and refinancing of debt that needs to happen this year and other factors.\nHowever, tariffs are unlikely to work as a tactic to solve the above.\nTRUMP RISKS IT ALL, TAKES ON THE WORLD WITH TARIFFS AND PUTS AMERICA FIRST\nIn the panic of \"do something,\" many Trump supporters are sacrificing principles, sounding more like the left then purveyors of conservative values.\nSmall businesses who bore the brunt of theCOVID mandates, their after-effects and inflation, are now at risk again. Those who have part or all of their supply chain abroad are going to have a hard time surviving if this goes on much longer and they are not exempted from tariffs.\nI have heard over and over again on social media that those businesses don\u2019t deserve to exist, basically the same thing that I wrote about in \"The War on Small Business\" after COVID, when the left told small businesses they needed to close for \"the greater good\" as they defined it.\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT TARIFFS AND THE HISTORY LESSON MANY CRITICS ARE MISSING\nThat\u2019s not freedom or America first \u2013 that\u2019s central planning garbage.\nMoreover, most of those spewing rhetoric don\u2019t realize that small businesses that have part of their business abroad is stillAmerica first.

The same businesses often have personnel in design, marketing, sales, administration and other functions in the U.S. that create American jobs.\nThey may sell all over the globe, getting desired products not just to Americans, but to citizens of other countries as well.

We\u2019ve been in business for more than 30 years. I witnessed firsthand the near collapse of my business during the tumultuous years of 2021-24.\nCrippled by COVID-19, supply chain disruptions, and unfair trade practices the previous administration neglected or even encouraged, my story mirrors the broader struggle of American industry. However, the Trump administration's 2025 tariff strategy, a \"stratified gambit,\" triggered a dramatic and unexpected turnaround.\nTRUMP'S TARIFF PAUSE THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF HIS PRAGMATISM ON THE POLITICAL STAGE\nIn the game of bridge, a \"stratified gambit\" is a strategic play where players are grouped at different levels, or \"strata,\" competing against those in their tier yet still part of a larger tournament. It's a layered competition that allows different skill levels to coexist, compete and win in their own way based on the player's strategy.\nRetired autoworker Brian Pannebecker, from Detroit, speaks alongside President Donald Trump as he delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs during an event in the Rose Garden entitled \"Make America Wealthy Again\" at the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 2, 2025.(Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images)\nToday, this is precisely what's happening with the American economy under theTrump administration's strategic use of tariffs. It\u2019s a multi-tiered economic gambit aimed at restoring trade balance, boosting national production and providing the forgotten American businesses and workers with a fighting chance.\nAnd that\u2019s all we ask for: For our own government to give us that fighting chance.\nUnlike conventional trade policies, Trump's tariff rollout was meticulously planned and layered, providing American industries vital time to adjust and reshore without facing immediate retaliatory shocks. This strategy signaled a decisive shift away from \"America last\" policies, prioritizing fair trade and bolstering domestic production.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nAgainst the backdrop of dire media predictions, Corvette Warehouse has experienced a remarkable surge in sales and renewed customer confidence. Consumers, driven by both financial and patriotic motivations, began \"buying American again.\" The tariffs effectively corrected longstanding trade imbalances, addressing years of outsourcing and currency manipulation that had eroded American industry. We\u2019ve seen our best week in nearly 36 months.\nAlongside advocacy for strategic, temporary trade protections, the tariffs serve to rectify market failures and unfair global competition. Coupled with potential interest rate reductions by theFederal Reserve, this strategy aims to stimulate domestic growth and alleviate the national debt. Yes, the Trump administration has \"paused\" the customized reciprocal tariffs, but the message is already coming through loud and clear.\nThe shift is palpable in the used-car market, with a notable increase in demand for American-made vehicles and trade-ins of foreign brands. This reflects a growing wave of economic patriotism, where consumers actively prioritize American-made goods. This is exactly what we need to bring jobs back home and rebuild American industry.\nNow, America needs further fiscal prudence, includingreduced government spendingand enhanced efficiency, to maximize the benefits of the tariff strategy. This is not isolationism but a strategic move toward balanced trade that supports American workers and businesses.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhat\u2019s coming next isa tangible revival of American industry. We must have strategic thinking and real-world experience in navigating the complex economic challenges ahead. Trump\u2019s \"stratified gambit\" is unfolding, and it\u2019s the right approach, reshaping the economic landscape and empowering American producers and consumers.\nPresident Trump is giving America the fighting chance we need.

Where is the homework? You know, Greek and Roman letters thrown on a plaque doesn't mean a strategy that you've informed Congress on,\" Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, asked. \"And part of the question is, where's the homework done by the administration to not misconstrue the authority that was given?\"\nSCHUMER SAYS TRUMP 'FEELING THE HEAT' AFTER RECIPROCAL TARIFF PAUSE\nCantwell may not have received a sufficient answer from the Trump administration on the rationale. But Sen.

They wanted the president to hold the hot potato. So now you've got a President who's happy to do that.\"\nArticle I, Section 8 of the Constitution declares that Congress has the \"Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\"\n\"Let's not pretend that this is anything other than the president exercising the statutory authority Congress has given him for decades,\" Sen.

Congress has ratified several of those in recent years. That includes the USMCA. That\u2019s a trade pact President Trump pushed \u2013 alongside former House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in 2020 for the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

Vietnam simply doesn't have the economy or the resources to import from the United States and to\u2026 provide that reciprocity,\" Kapadia explained.\nVietnam charges the U.S. a 90% tariff on imported goods to the nation. The Trump administration last week announced the Southeast Asian country will face a46% tariff on goods importedto the U.S.\nVietnam's industries are also deeply rooted in Chinese business investments, Kapadia said.\nMUSK SAYS HE HOPES FOR 'ZERO TARIFFS,' FREEDOM OF TRADE ZONE BETWEEN US AND EUROPE\n\"To add insult to injury, they also have been a hot bed for Chinese investment. Since the imposition of the Section 301 tariffs under the first Trump administration, which were these large-scale tariffs on Chinese imports, you had a whole number of Chinese companies across a variety of industries in the consumer product segment basically invest, instead, in factories in Vietnam as a way to circumvent paying tariffs, so the Chinese would keep their market share, but just go and make it in another country,\" he explained.\nChinese President Xi Jinping, left, and Vietnam President To Lam pass by an honor guard at a welcoming ceremony at the Great Hall of the People on Aug. 19, 2024 in Beijing.(Andres Martinez Casares-Pool/Getty Images)\nTrump signed a memo under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 in 2018 under his first administration targeting Chinese goods for U.S. tariffs in response to Chinese theft of American intellectual property, Trump said at the time.\n\"This was by far the worst day for the Vietnamese government, in the sense, they're realizing that that door has now closed. A 46% tariff \u2013 Vietnam is not an attractive country to import from.

Kappadia said the newest upcoming tariff and the \"high-band\" tariffs of 45% on some Chinese goods puts the country's tariff barrier at about 75% to 80%, which Kapadia predicted could grow to 150% by the end of 2025.\n\"That's because there's just a lot of ongoing challenges with China that have not begun to kind of roll-out or get resolved, and ultimately the United States is going to have to continue to pressure U.S. companies to invest more in the United States, and the only way to do that is to continue to put pressure on China,\" Kapadia said.\nThe trade expert continued that other nations, particularly European export sectors, could also see fallout from the tariff plan in regard to luxury products or household purchases, but that it's too early to predict where the chips will fall with Europe.\n\"I think that that might resolve itself over time, depending upon how the Europeans behave. From what we've seen, just early next week, we're going to have some dignitaries and officials from Europe come and visit the president to negotiate on a potential resolution. All in the meanwhile, they are threatening a retaliatory 20% tariff to kind of make this tit-for-tat based on the reciprocal tariff announcement, but we know from the president that all that's going to do is turn the 20% that we put on Europe to 40%,\" he said.\nKapadia pointed to India and Japan as the two nations that will benefit from Trump's tariff plan last week.\nHERE\u2019S A CLOSER LOOK AT TRUMP\u2019S TARIFF PLAN: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW DUTIES\n\"We have seen both the Japanese head of state and the Indian head of state come to Washington and provide the president with opportunities where they would then reduce their own tariff barriers,\" he said.\n\"Just a week before this announcement, Prime Minister Modi came out and provided a whole list to the government\u2026 that says, 'Here are all the things that I'm going to reduce, in terms of tariffs of U.S. exports to India' And so I think that's going to continue. And I think that they're going to make headway at getting toward more equitable trade between the two countries,\" he added.\nTrump unveiled a 27% tariff on India on \"Liberation Day\" and a 24% tariff on Japan.\nPresident Donald Trump and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Feb. 13, 2025.(Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\"I think that they're going to make headway at getting toward more equitable trade between the two countries, whether that's India and the U.S. or Japan and the U.S., and honestly serves to the U.S.' benefit to rectify some of those tariff barriers with India,\" he said. \"It is the largest democratic country in the world, and they are strategic ally for geopolitical reasons and a number of other considerations. And so they're going to be a country that I think we have to watch and really see how they negotiate their way through this new tariff regime.\"\nKapadia pointed to a handful of U.S. companies that operate in India, such as Lego, Apple and Goldman Sachs, and predicted companies that have made large-scale investments in India will likely stay there, while they will likely move other overseas operations in nations facing even higher tariffs, such as Vietnam, to India.\nTRUMP TOUTS RETURN OF \u2018AMERICAN DREAM\u2019 IN HISTORIC TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENT\n\"You name it, a whole slew of U.S. companies have made concerted, large-scale investments in India. I think that they're going to stick to them. I think they're going to grow there. And if you look at the difference, just on our arbitrage basis, 46% versus 26% \u2013 that's a big Delta. So if you're Apple, and you're making Apple technology, Apple-related products in Vietnam, and you're importing at 46%, or you're making it in India at 26%, you're obviously going to double down on your India effort,\" he said.\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in the Oval Office of the White House on Feb. 7, 2025.(Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images)\nKapadia continued that Trump's latest tariff policies target corporate America, which opens the doors to which industries will move back to U.S. soil to avoid the tariffs. He pointed to \"critical industries\" such as semiconductor manufacturing, critical minerals, aluminum and steel manufacturing delivering large-scale investments in the U.S. both this year and next year, to increase capacity and production \"out of necessity.\" He noted that Trump's customized reciprocal tariffs are not stackable with existing tariffs on certain industry imports, such as steel and aluminum.\nHERE'S WHAT HAPPENED DURING TRUMP'S 11TH WEEK IN OFFICE\n\"That's going to be the opportunity for the jobs to be created, for the investment to happen. Whereas on the multilateral kind of, 'Hey, here's our new kind of blended rate for these 60 odd countries,' that's just going to be finding more equity with a foreign direct investment from those countries,\" he said.\nIn America's Rust Belt, which stretches from Illinois to upstate New York, critical industries are ramping up production under the second Trump administration and locals are excited after decades of old industrial towns economically suffering,Ohio Republican Rep.

{"title": "SEN RAND PAUL: Terminate the Trump tariffs before it's too late", "date": "2025-04-04", "body": "President Donald Trump predicts US will ultimately flourish and 'boom' because of his tariffs plan.\nIf you think eggs are expensive, just wait until the new tariffs hit cars. Goldman Sachs\u00a0estimates tariffs on imported vehicles could raise prices by $5,000 to $15,000. That\u2019s because tariffs are taxes on foreign imports that are paid by American consumers. These tariffs apply to almost every conceivable product. As a result, energy will be more expensive, andgas pricesin some parts of the country could see as much as a 70-cent increase in the cost per gallon. According to the National Association of Home Builders, the\u00a0building of a single-family home could become up to $10,000 more expensive because of the tariffs. With the tariffs on aluminum, even beer and hard seltzer are likely to increase in price.\nUnfortunately, these tax increases are on top ofthe taxesyou have already paid when tariffs were imposed during the first Trump administration. The Tax Foundation calculated that tariffs between 2018 and 2023 imposed an additional $1,753 in costs on American families. Now that the tariffs apply to even more products, the tax increases are poised to be even higher this time. The Peterson Institute predicts tariffs could annually cost families $1,200 a year, while Yale\u2019s Budget Lab estimates the tariffs would cost the average American family $4,200 annually.\nThe fact that tariffs are taxes paid by consumers is not news to the American people. That is why vehicle sales\u00a0jumped almost 13% \u00a0last month as Americans sought to make their purchases before the 25% tariffs on motor vehicles and parts went into effect.\nVICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE SAYS TRUMP IS 'TAKING THIS ECONOMY IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION'\nConservatives used to publicly acknowledge that tariffs are taxes paid by Americans. Milton Friedman stated plainly that tariffs \"raise prices to customers and waste our resources.\" Ronald Reagan similarly opposed protectionism because it \"costs consumers billions of dollars, damages the overall economy, and destroys jobs.\"\nBut the actions of those who now advocate for tariffs acknowledge the damage tariffs cause, even if their words do not. Recently, the Secretary of Agriculture\u00a0indicated the administration was preparing programs to mitigate \"economic catastrophes\" for farmers harmed by tariffs\u2014a clear admission that tariffs hurt Americans. The firstTrump administrationauthorized $28 billion in farmer bailouts to offset financial losses caused by tariffs. Do Americans expect to get hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars back from the government to pay for their increased costs caused by the tariffs? Of course not.\nTariffs are not just bad for American families and the national economy; tariffs are also bad for Republicans.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nTariffs have been electoral disasters for Republicans.\u00a0The McKinley Tariff of 1890 caused such a spike in prices that theRepublican Partylost nearly 100 seats in the House and by the end of the next election, the House, Senate, and White House were all in Democratic hands.\nWhen the House passed the Smoot-Hawley tariff on May 28, 1929, stock prices in New York fell in June. Senate passage of the Smoot-Hawley tariff on March 24, 1930, triggered a dramatic fall in stock prices.And, on June 17, 1930, President Herbert Hoover signed the bill into law, the stock market plummeted even farther.\nThe 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariff worsened the Great Depression and wiped out the Republican Party. By 1933, Republicans lost over 100 seats in the House as well as their majorities in both chambers of Congress.\nEven seniority and power could not save the tariff\u2019s authors and president who signed it into law the next time they faced the voters. Oregon Republican Congressman WillisHawley, who served 26 years in the House, was not renominated to return to his seat. After serving five terms in the Senate, RepublicanSenator Reed Smoot,of Utah, was defeated in 1932.

{"title": "Biden\u2019s leftover regulations will decide your next light bulb unless Trump stops them", "date": "2025-04-04", "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\nAmericans have shown a real dislike for the wave offederal regulations targeting home appliances.Even more infuriating is the fact that our tax dollars bankroll this unwanted agenda. It is time to pull the plug on those inside and outside the government who make a living micromanaging our appliance choices.\nA threatened regulatory crackdown on\u00a0gas stoves\u00a0in 2023 sparked a surprisingly strong public backlash, but it did not deterBiden administration regulatorsfrom going after\u00a0nearly every other home appliance,\u00a0including washing machines, refrigerators, furnaces, dishwashers, air conditioners, light bulbs and water heaters.\nMost of these rules are from the Department of Energy (DOE), specifically its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). That office has an annual budget north of $3 billion and a staff of hundreds, about a quarter of which is devoted to energy efficiency.\nGOP LAWMAKERS UNLEASH PROPOSAL TO REVERSE BIDEN'S 'ILL-INFORMED' POLICIES CRIPPLING CRUCIAL INDUSTRY\nJust about every clich\u00e9 there is for a bureaucracy run amok \u2013 moving back the goalposts, mission creep etc. \u2013 is true in spades for EERE and its energy efficiency regulations. Many appliances have been subjected to three, four, or even five rounds of successively tighter energy efficiency regulations over the years, with no end in sight.\nThe Biden administration's war on home appliances featured a campaign against gas stoves. (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\nAt this point, it is not unusual for regulations to substantially boost the up-front cost of an appliance, in some cases more than is likely to be earned back in the form of energy savings.\u00a0 Nor is it out of the ordinary for standards to compromise appliance choice, features, performance, or reliability in the single-minded obsession with forcing less energy use.\nTo take but one example, EERE regulated traditional incandescent light bulbs off the market by imposing a series of efficiency regulations they cannot meet. Taking their place over the last decade have been light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, which are more efficient and can meet the standards but cost more and are not to everyone\u2019s liking.\nTo be fair, the initial assault on incandescent bulbs was required under a\u00a02007 statute,\u00a0but as usual the regulators have now gone beyond any legal requirements. The most recent light bulb regulation, published last April, is\u00a0so strict\u00a0that most currently available LEDs can\u2019t comply either, and average prices will rise from $2.98 to an agency-estimated $5.68.\u00a0Keep those candles handy.\nEven worse are regulations that compromise appliance performance, such as the\u00a0dishwasher regulations\u00a0that have doubled the time it takes to do a load from about an hour in pre-standards models to more than two today. Rather than try to fix the problems with existing dishwasher regulations, the Biden DOE came out with yet another set of incrementally tighter energy and water use limits \u2013 its fifth overall.\nClimate change became the Biden administration\u2019s all-purpose rationale for further tightening the screws on appliances. This explains the efforts to use these regulations to discourage appliances that run on natural gas, a fossil fuel. Beyond stoves, other appliances that come in both electric and natural gas versions, such as furnaces and water heaters, now face costly regulations designed to tilt the market away from gas. In the case of furnaces, the additional cost of a compliant gas model could be as high as\u00a0$867, the agency estimates.\nAssisting the federal regulators inside the government is an army of activists outside of it who also make a nice living \u2013 partially at taxpayer expense \u2013 off the appliance game. This includes organizations that focus primarily on appliance regulations as well as big environmental groups that cover appliance efficiency along with many other green causes.\nFor example, the Rocky Mountain Institute, which remains at the forefront of the efforts to ban gas stoves, has no less than\u00a0six federal agencies\u00a0contributing part of its $139 million dollar annual budget.\nSeveral of these groups have recently received extra cash pursuant to the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Even some manufacturers have been showered with IRA giveaways stretching into the\u00a0tens of millions of dollars each\u00a0to make appliances favored by this agenda.\nStacey Abrams is part of Rewiring America, which received $2 billion from the Biden administration.(CBS)\nPolitical favoritism appears to play a role in deciding who gets these handouts. For example, Democrat Stacey Abrams, after twice losing the Georgia governor\u2019s race, moved on to a leadership position at an environmental organization called Rewiring America that is active in this space.\nIn particular, Rewiring America is pushing hard to eliminate natural gas appliances and make homes completely dependent on electricity. And now, the organization is part of a new coalition named Power Forward Communities that received a whopping\u00a0$2 billion dollar IRA grant\u00a0last April.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThese organizations can be counted on to fight for tougher appliance regulations. Several regularly submit comments to DOE in support of measures they want and against ones they don\u2019t, and some also sit on agency advisory committees that help fashion new rules. Many also push for state and local building code changes that favor their preferred appliance choices, and they now have\u00a0millions in IRA grants\u00a0to help stack the deck in their favor. These activities may not necessarily be illegal, but it is doubtful taxpayers would approve.\nIn addition, many green groups are involved in a never-ending stream of lawsuits against DOE, always on the side of more appliance red tape and often with the government paying attorneys\u2019 fees. Expect these litigants to pull out all the stops against any Trump administration reform efforts, as they did\u00a0during the first Trump administration.\nAssisting the federal regulators inside the government is an army of activists outside of it who also make a nice living \u2013 partially at taxpayer expense \u2013 off the appliance game.\nBottom line \u2013 homeowners\u2019 tax dollars are going to organizations that push for unwanted appliance meddling. Fortunately,President Donald Trumpis\u00a0reconsidering\u00a0many of the regulations, and the Department of Government Efficiency is looking for ways to stem further harmful outlays under the IRA. Congress is also targeting some specific appliance rules\u00a0for repeal\u00a0under the Congressional Review Act.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBut ultimately, the underlying laws must be changed. First, Congress needs to sunset EERE\u2019s appliance regulatory program and the government bureaucracy that lives off it. Just as important, Congress should defund all the organizations that have grown around this program, including blocking the IRA dollars not yet spent.\nNeither the appliance bureaucrats nor their activist allies have the support of the American people. Both should stop getting our money.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM BEN LIEBERMAN\nBen Lieberman is a senior fellow who specializes in environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-leftover-regulations-decide-your-next-light-bulb-unless-trump-stops-them"}

Deep down, they\u2019re fighting fora shot at an American Dreamthat now feels more like a mirage.\nWhether it\u2019s United Auto Workers leaning into PresidentDonald Trump\u2019s message of \"Make America Great Again\" or Chicago public school educators digging into their pockets to buy supplies for vulnerable students, the working class represents an electorate long ignored by Washington.\nBoth Democrats and the Trump-informed Republican Party claim to champion workers, but working-class families nationwide still lack real, consistent representation in the halls of power.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, President Donald Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer(Getty Images)\nI\u2019ve seen it up close \u2013 alongside educators, higher education faculty, healthcare workers and public employees. I\u2019ve also listened to factory workers, grocery clerks, long-haul drivers and warehouse staff. Whether in a union hall in the Rust Belt, a hospital in the Sunbelt, or a classroom in Detroit, the message is the same:working people feel unheardand undervalued.\nTHE SURPRISING WAY TRUMP CAN UNLEASH AMERICA\u2019S ECONOMIC COMEBACK\nLabor unions, often demonized by big business and political operatives, are the sum of their parts: everyday working people striving for better.\nThat includes cafeteria workers who kept schoolchildren fed during the pandemic, even when schools were closed; hospital technicians pulling overnight shifts so patients receive care; sanitation crews braving winter storms to keep cities clean; and adjunct professors educating future leaders while barely scraping by. These Americans come together not for power or profit but for dignity \u2013 fighting for better pay, safer conditions and a stable life.\nBut this isn\u2019t just about unions. Millions of workers \u2013unionized or not\u2013 are exhausted, underpaid and navigating broken systems. Yet, they remain the backbone of our economy. In fact, consumer spending by working\u2013 and middle-class families accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. economic activity \u2013 a staggering figure that underscores how deeply labor and livelihoods are tied to the nation\u2019s financial health.\nNEW DEMS READY TO MOVE PARTY AND COUNTRY BEYOND TRUMP CHAOS\nEducators, from kindergarten teachers to adjunct professors, are still paid less than their peers in other fields while facing burnout. Healthcare workers are stretched thin in understaffed facilities. Public employees are asked to do more with less. Meanwhile, private-sector workerscontinue to face job insecurity, outsourcing and wage stagnation.\nThough working-class voters across much of the South and Midwest helped send Donald Trump back to the White House, they also voted pretty clearly on the issues \u2013 including higher wages, paid leave, public schools and reproductive rights.\nOn a recent visit to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania \u2013 and at town halls across the country \u2013 I saw and heard the same thing: people are tired. Tired of broken promises. Tired of political theater. Tired of seeing their lives used as props during elections, only to be forgotten once the votes are counted.\nThe most powerful stories don\u2019t come from podiums. They come from the nurses in North Carolina who are marching to the state Capitol to demand safer staffing. They also come from the stadium workers in Detroit who haven\u2019t taken a sick day in years because missing a paycheck could mean missing rent.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nThese aren\u2019t abstract issues. They\u2019re daily realities. And the people living them deserve more than lip service. Their perseverance, sacrifice and quiet acts of love should be at thecenter of our political conversations.\nIt\u2019s time leaders started listening \u2013 not just during campaigns but always. The working class isn\u2019t asking for much, just respect, a living wage, good schools, affordable healthcare and a dignified life.\nThat shouldn\u2019t be too much to ask in the wealthiest country in the world. And yet, here we are.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe results of Missouri\u2019s 2024 ballot measures, loudly and clearly, said what the people wanted. But too often, lawmakers choose special interests over the public interest.\nEven with poll after poll showing American support for neighborhood public schools, members of Congress are pushing a national school choice bill that would drain public dollars into private institutions. If we want to rebuild trust in our democracy, we have to listen to the people who keep it running. The ones who teach, heal, build and serve. The people in red hats and blue T-shirts who, despite the noise, are more united than we think.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM RICHARD FOWLER\nRichard Fowler is a contributor to FOX News Media and an adjunct professor of journalism at Georgetown University.

As a result, this has siphoned auto manufacturers' resources away from gas-powered vehicle production and toward EV production, ultimately pushing the costs of gas-powered cars higher, according a report by the AEI.\nIf auto manufacturers do not produce enough EVs to meet state and federal standards, they are forced to buy into a credit system to offset their emissions production, inevitably creating another avenue where additional costs are transferred to consumers, according to the report.\nGOP LAWMAKER SEEKS TO SLAM BRAKES ON BIDEN'S \u2018WOKE AND WASTEFUL\u2019 EV TAX CREDIT\nUtility costs also see an impact, AEI's report points out. State and federal subsidy and rebate programs for EV charging infrastructure, while beneficial for utility companies' profits, lead once more to increased costs that are subsequently passed on to rate payers. Forty states offer rebates for in-home level two chargers, while at the federal level, rebate and subsidy programs for EV charging infrastructure received an investment of roughly $7.5 billion under formerPresident Joe Biden.\n\"By distorting the market with regulatory credits, subsidies, and behind-the-scenes rulemaking, federal agencies are shifting costs from affluent EV buyers to working-class Americans \u2014 while straining a grid that\u2019s already under pressure,\" said Jason Isaac, co-author of the report and the founder and CEO of AEI. \"This isn\u2019t about consumer choice or energy innovation. It\u2019s administrative overreach that leaves Americans paying more to drive and to keep the lights on.\"\nIsaac, a formerTexas state representative, admitted that during his time in the legislature, he worked to create an EV subsidy in the Lone Star State, which provided all EV buyers with a $2,500 tax credit. He said that over time, he realized the majority of fully electric vehicles were being purchased by wealthier individuals who, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, would have done so even without the subsidies.\n\"This policy is not a home run,\"saidHunt Allcott, a professor of environmental social sciences and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, with regard to the federal EV tax credit system. \"While the [Inflation Reduction Act's] electric vehicle tax credits have slowed climate change and shifted production to U.S. manufacturing firms, they also impose high costs on U.S. taxpayers.\"\nTOP AGENCY STAFFER TRYING TO BLOCK CRUCIAL TRUMP DIRECTIVE ONCE MANAGED DEI TEAM\nEach EV that's purchased benefits from an estimated $94,000 to $153,000 in hidden subsidies over a 10-year period, according to research from the AEI. These figures account for the costsautomakersbear to meet government mandates as well as losses from forced EV production, expenses that ultimately raise prices for consumers.\nA Tesla charges at an electric vehicle charging station in New York.\nRebates and subsidies for EV charging infrastructure are driving up base utility rates for consumers as well, the AEI report states. It is estimated that if each EV sold resulted in one in-home or commercial charging infrastructure, the more than 1.1 million EVs sold in 2023 would have received more than $827 million in residential charging tax credits.\nIsaac said these rebates and subsidies are then used by utility companies to lobby public utility commissions to approve higher base rates because they are enhancing their infrastructure to improveEV infrastructure.\n\"When you go buy a gallon of gasoline, [taxpayers] are not helping you pay for that gallon of gasoline; all the costs are embedded within a gallon of gasoline,\" Isaac said. \"So the typical EV charge, whatever they pay at the charging station, is only a small portion of the expenses. That charging station itself has received a significant subsidy, both from the state and the federal government, and the utility has come in and increased the infrastructure or improved, enhanced the infrastructure to handle that load, and the rate payers in that particular area are picking up that burden.\"\nDEMOCRATS TURN ON TESLA DESPITE YEARS-LONG ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH\n\"Eliminating these costly EV mandates is exactly the kind of action needed under President Trump\u2019s energy emergency,\" says American Energy Institute's Jason Isaac. \"It would jump-start a resurgence in the American auto industry, lower the price of new vehicles and ease pressure on our electric grid, bringing down energy costs for every household.\"(AP/Getty/Fox)\nOne anecdote used in the report to illustrate the cost burden of EV charging subsidies and rebates posits that if one homeowner were to purchase anEV chargeron a street of 10 people, and the local electric company provides that homeowner with a $500 rebate, the downhill impacts lead to each of the 10 households shouldering a roughly $50 cost to build the charger as a result of the subsidized rate increases.\nThe increased costs on gas-powered car buyers and utility rate payers, Isaac said, illustrates the need to get rid of these clean-air mandates.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Eliminating these costly EV mandates is exactly the kind of action needed under President Trump\u2019s energy emergency,\" Isaac said. \"It would jump-start a resurgence in the American auto industry, lower the price of new vehicles and ease pressure on our electric grid, bringing down energy costs for every household.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to several EV advocacy groups, including Drive Change.

If it wasn\u2019t enough for Canada to rip our products off shelves, the EU\u2019s threat of 50% tariffs on American whiskey, set to take effect\u00a0on April 13, now jeopardizes decades of progress and market expansion in Europe.\nPresident Donald Trump is right:We must trade with the worldin a fair and reciprocal manner. That\u2019s a model that has served the spirits industry well for decades. Small whiskey distillers like me are now counting on the president to strike a deal to ensure zero-for-zero tariffs on American whiskey, starting with the EU.\nMuch is at stake, including jobs,local agriculture and centuries of progress and pride in our craft. So ingrained is whiskey in American history that George Washington himself became a major distiller of rye whiskey after his presidency. But never has our legacy as a nation of distillers been as robust as it is today.\nSTOCKS RISE AFTER TRUMP TEASES 'NICER' TARIFF POLICY\nIn the past 20 years, an explosion of distilleries nationwide \u2014 from 50 in 2005 to more than 3,000 today \u2014 has taken the variety and reputation of American whiskey to new heights, expanding this subtle art to small towns such as Swisher, Iowa, where I operate my family-owned craft distillery. From these communities, our distinctive products have earned an international fanbase.\nJeff Quint is founder and CEO of Cedar Ridge Distillery in Swisher, Iowa, and producer of Cedar Ridge Iowa Bourbon.\nChief among those distinctive products is bourbon, which by definition can be distilled in any state in America, not just Kentucky. American whiskeys, such as bourbon, were exported from 37 states in 2024. In recent years, bourbon has become a sensation in foreign countries, earning a place alongside other national categories like scotch (a distinctive product of Scotland) and tequila (a distinctive product of Mexico).\nThese international markets are essential for the growth of small distilleries. Here in the U.S., there is only so much bourbon we can sell. A 50% tariff on bourbon in the EU would hike prices sharply and curb demand just as it is taking off. Many American distilleries will be forced to stop exporting, which could lead to bourbon overcapacity in America.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nI have experienced the sting of tariffs firsthand. In 2016, my craft distillery \u2014 Cedar Ridge \u2014 started the arduous but exciting process of establishing our brand in the EU. It takes three to five years to find foreign distribution partners, promote your brand and fight for shelf space in a new market before you see a dime of real profit.\nWe were devastated when, in 2018, just as we were getting our sea legs in Europe, the EU retaliated against U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs with a 25% tariff on American whiskey. Our business became collateral damage in a trade dispute that had nothing to do with us. The choice was either to raise our prices to cover the tariffs, eat the cost ourselves and take the loss, or pull out of the market entirely. We made the painful decision to pull out, as did many others.\nAt the time, the EU was the largest American whiskey export market. But between 2018 and 2021, our exports plunged 20%, from $552 million to $440 million. The EU suspended its tariffs in 2021, enabling exports to surge back even higher \u2014 to $699 million last year. But many small distilleries like mine stayed out of the market due to uncertainty over whether these tariffs would be reimposed.\nThat uncertainty is kryptonite for a small business. It leaves us paralyzed, unable to embark on a three-to-five-year investment journey when we know the rug could be pulled out at any moment. This hurts not just our family and our 65 employees, but the local Iowa farms we buy our grains from, the American manufacturers who make our barrels and bottles, and the other downstream industries that support us.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWe\u2019re counting on this administration to fight for us and restore certainty in our trade relationships, first with the EU before the\u00a0April 13\u00a0deadline, and then in Canada and other crucial markets.\u00a0There are also many markets where we do not have fair and reciprocal trade, and we hope that the Trump administration will open those doors for our great American products.\nOn the line is nothing less than America\u2019s whiskey legacy \u2014 centuries old and aged to perfection.\nJeff Quint is founder and CEO of Cedar Ridge Distillery in Swisher, Iowa, the producer of Cedar Ridge Iowa bourbon.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/eu-tariff-threats-crushing-craft-whiskey-distillers-like-me"}

NPR CEO Katharine Maher made a very belated admission to GOP questions about their harsh dismissal of the Hunter Biden laptop story as a \"pure distraction\" right before the 2020 election: \"Our current editorial leadership thinks that was a mistake, as do I.\" This was breaking news, because no one heard them admit that before now, when their taxpayer cash is on the line.\n2. Maher confessed that she would not send the same wild tweets she put out calling Trump a \"deranged racist sociopath\" and saying America was \"addicted to white supremacy.\" She called looting \"counterproductive,\" but it\u2019s \"hard to be mad\" about property crimes. She claimed she has \"evolved\" from these views. But these hot takes neatly match NPR\u2019s wokeness. They probably helped her get the gig.\n3. Both President and CEO of PBS Paula Kerger and Maher proclaimed against all the evidence that PBS and NPR news programs are nonpartisan and unbiased. Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon cited NewsBusters studies, like one that found the \"News Hour\" used 162 labels of \"far-right\" extremism and only six uses of \u2018far left\" terms.

Several Republicans cited the expose of NPR senior editor Uri Berliner, who found in research on the D.C. voter registrations of NPR newsroom employees that there were 87 Democrats and zero Republicans.

In Oregon, a state with aggressive climate goals, the Department of Transportation has anticipated that it will face an estimated $350 million budget shortfall due in part to declining gas tax revenues. California, which requires auto manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles, is looking at a potential loss of $5 billion \u2013 or 64% \u2013 over the next decade, according to analysts.\nJason Isaac is the founder and CEO of the American Energy Institute, a trade organization representing mainly oil and gas companies. He told Fox News Digital that states are losing about $2,506 in gas tax revenue per every EV sold.

The only company that's making money selling EVs is Tesla, and they're making money because they're selling fuel emissions credits to other automobile manufacturers,\" Isaac said. \"Tesla would just break even, maybe a little bit of profit, if it wasn't for the selling of the credits to Ford and GM, Stellantis, and other automobile manufacturers that are forced to buy fuel economy credits because of requirements from the federal government.\"\nAs a result, Isaac said, gas-powered car manufacturers are compelled to make moreelectric vehiclesin an effort to keep up with government mandates.\n\"It's really destroying the market,\" he said.\nEPA ADMINISTRATOR ROLLS BACK 31 BIDEN-ERA REGULATIONS\nHummer EVs are seen on the production line as former President Joe Biden tours the General Motors 'Factory ZERO' electric vehicle assembly plant, in Detroit, Michigan, on Nov. 17, 2021.(Reuters/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo)\nMeanwhile, Isaac posited, fuel economy mandates and the ongoing credit-buy-back system have generated a \"multi-billion dollar market out of nothing that's not improving fuel economy.\"\n\"There\u2019s bipartisan support to get rid of these credits,\" he said, adding that the move would help auto manufacturers relying on the system \"to make a comeback and truly improve fuel economy and vehicles, because they won't be wasting billions of dollars from vehicles that people just overwhelmingly don't want.

A debate has also emerged over raising the federal gas tax\u2014which has not increased since 1993\u2014as a potential solution.\nIsaac said that in addition to amending federal fuel economy standards, he noted that raising the registration fee for EVs is a good solution. He said putting a tax on electric-vehicle charging stations would likely not generate enough funds to make up for the lost revenue.\nIsaac also posited that he was not very keen on the implementation of a vehicle-mile travel tax. He suggested that it could serve as a \"regressive\" tax on lower-income people who are struggling with the cost of housing, because they will have to move out of urban areas to rural or suburban areas, increasing the amount of miles they need to travel for work and other activities.\nIsaac is not a proponent of raising the federal gas tax either.\n\"We don't need to raise the tax, we just need to spend our dollars more efficiently,\" Isaac said. \"I thinkDOGE is going to helpwith that efficiency, so that dollars are truly making it to the maintenance of our nation's infrastructure.\"", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/clean-air-mandates-gas-tax-revenues-roads-bridges-infrastructure-expert"}
